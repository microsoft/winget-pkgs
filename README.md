This repository contains the manifest files for the **Windows Package Manager** default source. You are highly encouraged to submit manifests for your favorite application.

> Note: At this time installers must be MSIX, MSI, APPX, or .exe application installers. Script-based installers and fonts are not currently supported.

The **Windows Package Manager** is an [open source client](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli) designed for command-line usage. If you are interested in exploring third-party repositories offering private winget package hosting, see [third-party repositories](THIRD_PARTY.md).

# Submitting a Package

To submit a package to this repository, you should follow these steps:

1. Follow the [Contributing](#Contributing) guidelines below.
2. [Author](AUTHORING_MANIFESTS.md) a Manifest.
3. [Test](#test-your-manifest) your manifest.
4. [Submit](#submit-your-pr) your pull request (PR).
5. Respond to any feedback in your PR.

> Note: Please check the package's manifest you intend to submit does not already exist in the repository, and there are no open PRs for it in order to avoid duplicates.

## Authoring a Manifest

A few different tools are available to help you author a manifest.

- [Windows Package Manager Manifest Creator](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-create)
- [YamlCreate.ps1](doc/tools/YamlCreate.md)
- Other WinGet Manifest Creators developed by the community:
  - [Komac - Kotlin Manifest Creator for WinGet](https://github.com/russellbanks/Komac) (maintained by [**@russellbanks**](https://github.com/russellbanks))

> Note: Only one manifest may be submitted per PR.

## Test your manifest

Now that you have authored your manifest, you should make sure it works as expected.

> Note: You will need to run `winget settings --enable LocalManifestFiles` in an administrative shell before working with local manifests.

### Locally

1. Verify the syntax by executing the following command:

```
winget validate <path-to-manifest>
```

2. Test the install by executing the following command:

```
winget install -m <path-to-manifest>
```

For more details, see ["Submit packages to Windows Package Manager"](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/package-manager/package) at Microsoft Docs.

### In Windows Sandbox

You can use the [Sandbox Test](Tools/SandboxTest.ps1) PowerShell script for testing a manifest installation in [Windows Sandbox](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-sandbox/windows-sandbox-overview). The manifest will be also validated.

Just provide the path to manifest as parameter:

```
.\Tools\SandboxTest.ps1 <path-to-manifest>
```

## Submit your PR

With the manifest verified, you will need to submit a PR. Your manifest should be located in the folder path matching

```
manifests\<first lower case letter of publisher>\<publisher>\<package>\<version>\
```

### Validation Process

The PR request will go through a validation process. The core team or the Microsoft bot (BOT) will use [labels](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/package-manager/package/winget-validation#pull-request-labels) to help during the process. In the event of a failure, the BOT will suggest the problem with the submission and assign the PR back to you.

### Respond to PR feedback

If the PR has been assigned to you, a timer is triggered. You will have 7 days to resolve the issue, or the BOT will automatically close the PR.

Submissions to the repository are reviewed by Windows Package Manager administrators and/or community moderators. We've provided a [Public Service Announcement](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs/issues/15674) to help identify these individuals.
