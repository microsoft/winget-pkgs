# Documentation Overview

## Authoring a Manifest

A few different tools are available to help you author a manifest.

- [Windows Package Manager Manifest Creator](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-create)
- [YamlCreate.ps1](tools/YamlCreate.md)
- Other WinGet Manifest Creators developed by the community:
  - [Komac - Community Manifest Creator](https://github.com/russellbanks/Komac) (maintained by [**@russellbanks**](https://github.com/russellbanks))

> [!Note]
> Only one manifest may be submitted per PR.

## Testing a Manifest

Now that you have authored your manifest, you should make sure it works as expected.

> [!Note]
> You will need to run `winget settings --enable LocalManifestFiles` in an administrative shell before working with local manifests.

### Locally

1. Verify the syntax by executing the following command:

```
winget validate --manifest <path-to-manifest>
```

2. Test the install by executing the following command:

```
winget install --manifest <path-to-manifest>
```

For more details, see ["Submit packages to Windows Package Manager"](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/package-manager/package) at Microsoft Docs.

### In Windows Sandbox


You can use the [Sandbox Test](../Tools/SandboxTest.ps1) PowerShell script for testing a manifest installation in [Windows Sandbox](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-sandbox/windows-sandbox-overview). The manifest will be also validated.

Just provide the path to manifest as parameter:

```
.\Tools\SandboxTest.ps1 <path-to-manifest>
```

## Submitting a Manifest

To submit a package to this repository, you should follow these steps:

1. Follow the [Contributing](#contributing) guidelines below.
2. [Author](Authoring.md) a Manifest.
3. [Test](#test-your-manifest) your manifest.
4. [Submit](#submit-your-pr) your pull request (PR).
5. Respond to any feedback in your PR.

> [!Note]
> Please check the package's manifest you intend to submit does not already exist in the repository, and there are no open PRs for it in order to avoid duplicates.

## Submit your PR

Once you have verified your manifest, it's time to submit a PR. Place your manifest in a folder path that matches the following structure:

```
manifests\<first lower case letter of publisher>\<publisher>\<package>\<version>\
```
### Validation Process

Your PR will go through a validation process. The core team or the Microsoft bot (BOT) will use  [labels](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/package-manager/package/winget-validation#pull-request-labels)  to assist during the process. In case of a failure, the BOT will suggest the problem with the submission and assign the PR back to you.

### Respond to PR feedback

If your PR has been assigned to you, a timer will be triggered. You will have 7 days to resolve the issue, or the BOT will automatically close the PR.

Submissions to the repository are reviewed by Windows Package Manager administrators and/or community moderators. To help identify these individuals, we have provided a  [Public Service Announcement](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs/issues/15674).
