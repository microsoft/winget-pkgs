                Hello @${issueAuthor},


                During installation testing, this application failed to install without user input. Did you forget to add Silent or SilentWithProgress switches?


                This can also happen when a dependency is missing. You can test based on the [documentation](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs/blob/master/doc/README.md#testing-a-manifest).


                Please investigate a fix and resubmit the Pull Request.


                You may also try using the [Windows Package Manager Manifest Creator](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-create) to determine the proper installer type. If the installer type is MSIX, MSI, or a known installer technology like NullSoft, Inno, etc. the wingetcreate tool can detect them and the winget client will know what switches to pass. If it's a .exe installer of an unknown type, you will need to search to determine the proper switches for Silent and SilentWithProgress.
