                This PR removes the last version of this package in the repository, meaning it will completely remove this package from WinGet.


                Please provide the reason for removal to help our moderators understand the context and check if the package requires an update or is available from another source.


                Is it available from another location? (This might be in error if the version is switching from semantic to string, or string to semantic.)
