                Hello @${issueAuthor},


                This package appears to depend on .dlls that aren't available via symlink. Support for this form of zipped binaries was implemented in:

                * microsoft/winget-cli/issues/2711


                To ensure this package works correctly for all users, the property `ArchiveBinariesDependOnPath` must be set to `true` at either the installer level or root level in the installer manifest. Additionally, your manifest will need to conform to the [1.9 manifest specification](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs/tree/master/doc/manifest/schema/1.9.0). Please update your PR accordingly.
