                Sorry we cannot process ${number} because you are changing validation-pipeline.yaml. Please remove that file from your PR. If you would like to discuss changes to validation-pipeline.yml, please file an issue.

                Hello @${issueAuthor},


                It looks like this pull request is missing the manifests folder. For example: manifests\<first letter of the publisher in lower-case>\<publisher>\<application>\<version>\*.yaml


                Please review the path of your manifest file and resubmit.
