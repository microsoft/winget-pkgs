                The package manager bot was blocked from installing one of the installers listed in the url field, and cannot continue.


                The application included in this pull request failed to pass the [Installers Scan](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/package/winget-validation) test. This test is designed to ensure that the application installs on all environments without warnings.


                Please check to ensure the installer URL is correct and update the URL and the Hash if a change is made.


                If the package is mistakenly flagged as malware, you can [submit the installer(s) to the Microsoft Defender team for analysis](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/filesubmission).
