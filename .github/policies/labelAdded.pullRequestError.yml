                Hello @${issueAuthor},


                The package manager bot determined there was an issue with the pull request. Make sure the manifest files are under the manifests\partition\publisher\appname\version directory and only one package version is being modified in your PR. The partition of the path must be the first letter of the publisher in lower-case.


                Example:

                Path: manifests / m / Microsoft / WindowsTerminal / 1.6.10571.0 / WindowsTerminal.yaml


                For details on the error, see the details link below in the build pipeline.
