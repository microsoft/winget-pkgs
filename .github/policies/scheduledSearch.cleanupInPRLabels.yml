# Due to limitations in the policy service, it isn't possible to check on the state of the linked PRs because of this
# the assumption is made that if a linked PR is merged, the issue will be closed automatically. If the issue doesn't
# close, then the PR must not have been merged and is either stale or was closed. Since there is no way to check for
# that state specifically, the policy checks to see if there has been any activity on the issue. Any comments, labels
# or other actions on the issue will reset the 15 day period.
