                The package manager bot determined that your submission uses a `Singleton` Manifest, which been deprecated in this repository. Please update your submission to use the newer multi-manifest format. If you built your manifest by hand, a tool like [WingetCreate](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-create) or [YamlCreate](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs/blob/master/doc/tools/YamlCreate.md) can help you build the multi-manifest.
