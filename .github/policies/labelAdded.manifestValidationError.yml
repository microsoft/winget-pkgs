                Please verify the manifest file is compliant with the package manager [1.6 manifest specification](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs/tree/master/doc/manifest/schema/1.6.0).


                Make sure the ID is of the form publisher.appname and that the folder structure is manifests\partition\publisher\appname\version.

                > Note: The path and "PackageIdentifier" are case sensitive.


                Be sure to use a tool like [VSCode](code.visualstudio.com) to make sure the manifest YAML syntax is correct. You can also validate your manifest using the `winget validate` command.


                For details on the specific error, see the details link below in the build pipeline.
