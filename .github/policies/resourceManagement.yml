                The package manager bot determined there was an issue with the pull request. Make sure the manifest files are under the manifests\partition\publisher\appname\version directory and only one package version is being modified in your PR. The partition of the path must be the first letter of the publisher in lower-case.


                Example:

                Path: manifests / m / Microsoft / WindowsTerminal / 1.6.10571.0 / WindowsTerminal.yaml


                For details on the error, see the details link below in the build pipeline.

                During installation testing, this application failed to install without user input. Did you forget to add Silent or SilentWithProgress switches?


                This can also happen when a dependency is missing. You can test with https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs#test-your-manifest.


                Please investigate a fix and resubmit the Pull Request.


                You may also try using the [Windows Package Manager Manifest Creator](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-create) to determine the proper installer type. If the installer type is MSIX, MSI, or a known installer technology like NullSoft, Inno, etc. the wingetcreate tool can detect them and the winget client will know what switches to pass. If it's a .exe installer of an unknown type, you will need to search to determine the proper switches for Silent and SilentWithProgress.

                I am sorry to report that the Sha256 Hash does not match the installer. This may be caused by using a vanity URL rather than a URL directly to the binary.


                Please check the HASH and submit again. Sorry for the inconvenience.

                This package fails because it is dependent on some frameworks, and we do not support the dependencies yet. See issue: microsoft/winget-cli#163

                In the meantime, if you include the dependencies in your package, it should pass.

                Hello @${issueAuthor},


                This package fails because it is dependent on the Visual Studio Runtime and we do not support the dependencies yet. See issue: microsoft/winget-cli#163


                In the meantime, if you include the dependencies in your package, it should pass.
