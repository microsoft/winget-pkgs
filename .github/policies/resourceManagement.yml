            The package manager bot determined that the metadata was not compliant.


            Please verify the manifest file is compliant with the package manager [1.4 manifest specification](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs/tree/master/doc/manifest/schema/1.4.0).

            Make sure the ID is of the form publisher.appname and that the folder structure is manifests\partition\publisher\appname\version.

            Note: The path and "PackageIdentifier" are case sensitive.


            Be sure to use a tool like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to make sure the manifest YAML syntax is correct.


            You could also try our [Windows Package Manager Manifest Creator](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-create) or the [YamlCreate script](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs/blob/master/doc/tools/YamlCreate.md).


            For details on the specific error, see the details link below in the build pipeline.

            During validation, the MSIX package was evaluated. There were either inconsistencies or values not present in the manifest.

            Please adjust the manifest accordingly.

            The package manager bot determined there was an issue with the pull request. Make sure the manifest files are under the manifests\partition\publisher\appname\version directory and only one package version is being modified in your PR. The partition of the path must be the first letter of the publisher in lower-case.


            Example:

            Path: manifests / m / Microsoft / WindowsTerminal / 1.6.10571.0 / WindowsTerminal.yaml

            During installation testing, this application failed to install without user input. Did you forget to add Silent or SilentWithProgress switches?


            This can also happen when a dependency is missing. You can test with https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs#test-your-manifest.


            Please investigate a fix and resubmit the Pull Request.


            You may also try using the [Windows Package Manager Manifest Creator](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-create) to determine the proper installer type. If the installer type is MSIX, MSI, or a known installer technology like NullSoft, Inno, etc. the wingetcreate tool can detect them and the winget client will know what switches to pass. If it's a .exe installer of an unknown type, you will need to search to determine the proper switches for Silent and SilentWithProgress.

            I am sorry to report that the Sha256 Hash does not match the installer. This may be caused by using a vanity URL rather than a URL directly to the binary.


            Please check the HASH and submit again. Sorry for the inconvenience.

            Hello @${issueAuthor},


            This package fails because it is dependent on some frameworks, and we do not support the dependencies yet. See issue: microsoft/winget-cli#163

            In the meantime, if you include the dependencies in your package, it should pass.

            This package fails because it is dependent on the Visual Studio Runtime and we do not support the dependencies yet. See issue: microsoft/winget-cli#163


            In the meantime, if you include the dependencies in your package, it should pass.

            One or more of the installer URLs doesn't appear valid.


            This may happen for sites with policies prohibiting distribution or use by third parties.


            This may happen for URLs pointing to domains that do not align with the publisher domain or package domain. If you could provide supporting evidence from the publisher that the URLs for the installer are correct, that would help us to validate and approve this PR.
