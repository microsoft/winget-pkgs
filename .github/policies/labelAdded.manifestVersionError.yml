                The package manager bot determined that the ManifestVersion key does not match any version currently approved for release. Please verify the manifest file is compliant with the package manager [1.10.0 manifest specification](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs/tree/master/doc/manifest/schema/1.10.0).


                For details on the specific error, see the details link below in the build pipeline.
