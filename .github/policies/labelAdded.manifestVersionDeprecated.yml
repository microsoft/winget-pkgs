                Hello @${issueAuthor},


                The package manager bot determined that the Manifest Version used in your submission has been deprecated in this repository. Please update your submission to use a newer manifest version. If you have used a tool like [WingetCreate](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-create) or [YamlCreate](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs/blob/master/doc/tools/YamlCreate.md), you may need to update to the latest version of the tool.


                For details on the specific error, see the details link below in the build pipeline.
