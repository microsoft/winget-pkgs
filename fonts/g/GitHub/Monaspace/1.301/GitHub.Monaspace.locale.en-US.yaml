ShortDescription: An innovative superfamily of fonts for code.
Description: The Monaspace type system is a monospaced type superfamily with some modern tricks up its sleeve. It consists of five variable axis typefaces. Each one has a distinct voice, but they are all metrics-compatible with one another, allowing you to mix and match them for a more expressive typographical palette.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  v1.301
  🫣 The italics in the 1.3 release were broken, as reported in #339. This was caused by an incorrect setting in our build pipeline; we have regenerated the files with the correct setting.
  Thank you to @codeman38 @douglascamata @cmdrrobin @vikky49 for the detailed report! 🔥 🔡
