ShortDescription: PH-UKL is the first Unicode-based keyboard layout made for the Filipino nation and state of the Philippines.
Description: |
  The Philippines Unicode Keyboard Layout or PH-UKL is the first Unicode-based keyboard layout made for the Filipino nation and state of the Philippines. Its main feature is the incorporation of the characters commonly used in the Philippines especially the Philippine Peso Sign (₱). Prior to this, Filipinos have to use a strike-through letter P (P); the Dollar Sign ($) [the de facto universal currency sign but is confusing today]; or the not-so-common neutral currency symbol: ¤

  PH-UKL also comes with Baybayin (incorrectly known as Alibata) keyboard layout, in particular the Tagalog variant. Baybayin is the original writing script of most, if not all, Filipino ancestors. Originally thought to be a dead script, it was discovered that there are still Filipino tribes who actively use Baybayin as part of their culture, undisturbed by time.
