ShortDescription: Nightly builds for youtube-dl.
ReleaseNotes: |-
  This is a nightly build of youtube-dl.
  I've marked this as latest (ie, not a pre-release). It should now be possible to get videos that require authentication (using cookies), private, age-gated, etc, albeit with fewer formats, but please report any issues or even confirm success, especially for premium users and music.youtube.com. Other more complex usages with, eg, JSON, playlists, subtitles, are not well tested: please report issues that you find according to ytdl-org/youtube-dl#30839.
