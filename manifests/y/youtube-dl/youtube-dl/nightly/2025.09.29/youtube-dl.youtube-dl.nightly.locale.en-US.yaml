ShortDescription: Nightly builds for youtube-dl.
ReleaseNotes: |-
  This is a nightly build of youtube-dl.
  As it appears to work for me with the basic cases that were previously failing, I've now marked it as latest (ie, not a pre-release). More complex usages with, eg, JSON, playlists, subtitles, cookies, are not well tested: please report issues that you find according to ytdl-org/youtube-dl#30839.
