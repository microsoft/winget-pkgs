ReleaseNotes: |-
  NOTE: This release significantly reworked how it detects where Doom engines store their data files (configs, saves, ...), because the previous detection didn't work correctly for many engines. That means if you previously relied on the auto-detection when adding new engines, your setup is now wrong. When you start this version for the first time, it will ask you if you want to keep your current settings or re-detect all paths according to the new (hopefully correct) rules, and if you select "Yes" it will fix your setup automatically.
  Other changes:
  - new application icon
  - fixed the output path format for Windows (slashes)
  - added an ability to prepend the command with a prefix
  - added an option to load maps after mods
  - added new launch option "Resume demo" (for DSDA-Doom)
  - added dmflags3 options for latest GZDoom
  - added pistolstart option for those engines that support it
  - added support for Woof multiplayer parameters
  - added an ability to choose player name and suit color for multiplayer (ZDoom family)
  - fixed the port spin-box up/down buttons
  - fixed loading saved games for PrBoom, DSDA-Doom and Woof
  - removed the no longer used mod dir from Initial Setup dialog
  - reorganized the second tab so that the launcher fits into a small resolution screen
  - minor bug-fixes and optimizations
  For package maintainers: This is the first version that is compatible with Qt 6. It still works with Qt 5, but its support will officially end soon, so Qt 6 should be preferred whenever possible.
  If you don't know which binary release to choose, read Which Windows release should you take (legacy vs recent)
  And finally .... the MacOS builds are back ðŸ™‚
