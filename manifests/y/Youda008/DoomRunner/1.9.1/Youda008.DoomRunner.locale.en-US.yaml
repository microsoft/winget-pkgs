ReleaseNotes: |-
  This version fixes several quite serious bugs. Sorry that it took so long.
  Bug fixes:
  - fixed crash when reordering mods on some operating systems
  - fixed all dmflags2 being mistakenly put into dmflags3
  - fixed broken layout with Qt versions older than 6.8
  - fixed compatibility with the KEX-based Doom re-release (the file paths will be absolute)
  - fixed the special character escaping in the "Additional arguments" lines
  - fixed tooltips for the Custom data sub-directories and some gameplay flags
  Changes in behaviour:
  - only add -pistolstart and +sv_cheats to the command if the engine supports it (to prevent errors when starting)
  - allowed entering absolute paths into the "Custom data sub-directories" fields
  - Demo directory is now a separate directory from Save directory with its own override
  New features:
  - introduced "Doom Mod Bundles" (for a quick demonstration see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvUpT2ZegJ0)
  - added the possibility to copy&paste mods from one preset to another
  - added "Move to top/bottom" actions to the right-click menu
  - added "Open file" action to the right-click menu
  - added possibility to hide the map list help label via a right click
