  Important changes
  - A stopgap release with a TEMPORARY partial fix for YouTube support
    Some formats may still be unavailable, especially if cookies are passed to yt-dlp. The NEXT release, expected very soon, will require an external JS runtime (e.g. Deno) in order for YouTube downloads to work properly. Read more
  - The minimum required Python version has been raised to 3.10
    Python 3.9 has reached its end-of-life as of October 2025, and yt-dlp has now removed support for it. Read more
