ReleaseNotes: |-
  Important changes
    Beginning with this release, yt-dlp's Python dependencies must be installed using the default group
    If you're installing yt-dlp with pip/pipx or requiring yt-dlp in your own Python project, you'll need to specify yt-dlp[default] if you want to also install yt-dlp's optional dependencies (which were previously included by default). Read more
    The minimum required Python version has been raised to 3.9
    Python 3.8 reached its end-of-life on 2024.10.07, and yt-dlp has now removed support for it. As an unfortunate side effect, the official yt-dlp.exe and yt-dlp_x86.exe binaries are no longer supported on Windows 7. Read more
