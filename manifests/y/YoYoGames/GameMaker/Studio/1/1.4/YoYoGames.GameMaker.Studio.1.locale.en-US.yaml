ReleaseNotes: |-
  Headline Changes Since 1804
  - Removal of Online Connectivity in the IDE
    - The News feed has been disabled (also stops the script errors shown on startup in previous versions)
    - Links to the Marketplace and for managing your YoYo Account have been removed - please use your browser to do this now
    - Demos and Tutorials now work off a download, rather than the online feeds - see this "Download Studio 1.4 Demos And Tutorials" Hepdesk FAQ for more info
    - GGS support for automatically downloading our third-party extensions has been removed - please download in your browser and drag the package onto the IDE to import the extension to your project
  - macOS
    - In order to comply with current AppStore requirements and ahead of Xcode and Mojave being 64bit-only, we've removed the 32bit components of macOS packages
    - NOTE: This will require you to update any 32bit extensions you're using, to ensure your projects are Xcode/AppStore/Mojave compliant
    - NOTE: If you do not need AppStore support and want to instead continue using the older Xcode and 32bit packages, please continue using 1804 for this
    - Deprecated the synchronous developer get_...() dialog functions, so they now do nothing in-game (avoids errors) - use the ..._async() versions instead
  - iOS
    - As per Mac above, only 64bit information is added into packages now, in order to avoid AppStore submission issues. See the two Notes above.
    - Fixed playing music externally and then running your game could crash the game or result in broken audio
    - Fixed getting a call or other system notification sound crashed your game
    - Fixed the iPhone X home bar being visible all the time
    - Fixed message dialogs to stop crashes when trying to show code errors on iOS 11+ because the OS has changed how message dialogs work
    - Ignore GGS's "Minimum Time to Display" to fix black splash screen on startup if you had set this option greater than 0 in versions since we changed the splash screen method
    - Deprecated the synchronous developer get_...() dialog functions, so they now do nothing in-game (avoids errors) - use the ..._async() versions instead
  - Ubuntu
    - Fixed the name of the audio library the runner looks for on starting the game - fixes lack of audio for some users
    - Fixed "Error deleting sources + buffers" error when trying to close games
    - Fixed sounds popping when stopped if another sound is played directly afterwards
  - Android
    - Fixed memory leak when using HTTP functionality and also a memory management issue which could have crashed the game if lots of HTTP traffic
    - Deprecated the synchronous developer get_...() dialog functions, so they now do nothing in-game (avoids errors) - use the ..._async() versions instead
  - UWP
    - Fixed the window size always being locked to a fixed size dictated by the UWP tools
    - Fixed url_open() so it now works the same as Windows native
  - HTML5
    - Fixed 0029360: HTML5: Audio doesn't play on iOS Safari, iOS Chrome or Android Chrome
    - NOTE: Fix is for iOS and Android only - Windows Chrome betas currently exhibit this also, but Chrome are not yet committed to keeping the change on desktops
    - NOTE: This change does mean initial loading times for HTML5 will now be longer while the audio files in your game are downloaded
    - Fixed Mouse Pressed events not working on scaled canvases because the collision mask is offset
    - Fixed mouse coordinates aren't scaled to match when your window or view is scaled
    - Fixed functions to set the gain on an audio resource so they work as per native platforms
    - Fixed high refresh rate monitors cause the game to run quicker than intended in Chrome and Firefox
  - Changed the default size of the GUI layer
    - Changed the default GUI size for Draw GUI events to match the application_surface size so it is more consistent cross-platform
    - Fixes various issues, such as text placement on some platforms (e.g., Mac)
    - NOTE: If you use a Draw GUI event to scale your GUI and draw the application_surface, you might need to change your project to maintain your expected results:
    - In your first object's Create/Game Start, you could do "var pos = application_get_position(); display_set_gui_maximise(1, 1, pos[0], pos[1]);"
    - Depending on your project, you might find also that simply changing your Draw GUI event to be a Post Draw gives the intended result
    - See the manual for more information
  - Fast Collisions Fixes
    - Lots of fixes have been added for the Fast-Collisions system (if you enabled this for your project in GGS)
    - Includes deactivating and reactivating instances doesn't refresh collision status, collision information persisting in the wrong room or after game_restart()
    - Multiple fixes for Spine sprites and collisions, also ensuring that Animation Events fire correctly
  - New Audio System Fixes
    - Lots of fixes for the new audio engine released with 1804
    - Better support for stereo files being incorrectly used for positional audio
    - Fixes for: volume levels and sync groups, audio distortion or lower quality output files than expected, whitespace "hissing" from very high bitrate ogg files, and more
    - Fixes for the wrong sounds playing on audio_play_sound(), especially after using an emitter to play audio.
  - Misc
    - Fixed sprite_add_from_surface() to now show a code error if the sprite has not already been duplicated (as is required), rather than crashing the game
  - Known Issues
    - iOS and macOS Entitlements for IAPs and Game Center are not being set correctly in Xcode during builds, so you need to enable these manually when doing Create Exe
    - For UWP YYC builds, you must have the old Windows SDK 10.0.10240.0 as well as our stated minimum, as Visual Studio 2015 expects Windows SDK 10.0.10240.0 to be installed
    - Some audio devices can cause the runner to take longer than normal to initialise when running projects, so you might need to disable these temporarily
    - Monitors with refresh rates higher than 60hz can cause timing issues on Windows, games run more slowly than expected on these devices
    - Android NDK 17b above is not supported and neither is ARM64 package builds
