ReleaseNotes: |-
  2023.11 brings lots of behind-the-scenes performance improvements to both the IDE and Runtime; various new functions have been added to expand what you can do with buffers and rooms; following on from the SDF Effects added last release, you can now apply these effects to text tracks within your Sequences; you can now create your own Game Strip projects (and there is a new template you can use to learn about Game Strips); and there is a very large number of bug fixes and also some of the popular community requests since our public request system was revealed a few months ago.
  For all the public general changes and bug fixes added for 2023.11 click here to open the Bugs Milestone page and for all of the public new features click here to open the Feature Requests Milestone page

  Changes To The Release Notes
  - The milestone pages linked already higher up this page shows what is fixed or changed in this release (the "Closed" list on each page)
  - It also shows you what else is intended for the Monthly release and is yet to be fixed or implemented (the "Open" list on each page)
  - You can expand the "Show More" near the top of the page to read the overview/summarised information about what's in the release
  - Both lists will stay up-to-date during Beta periods as features are added and bugs are found, and so this is the new way of seeing all of the "Headline Known Issues" during Betas also
  - To see what's already planned for upcoming releases or (in future!) went into old releases, you can do this on the Milestones list pages also: Bugs - Feature Requests
