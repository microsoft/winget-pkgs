ReleaseNotes: |-
  2023.11 brings lots of behind-the-scenes performance improvements to both the IDE and Runtime; various new functions have been added to expand what you can do with buffers and rooms; following on from the SDF Effects added last release, you can now apply these effects to text tracks within your Sequences; you can now create your own Game Strip projects (and there is a new template you can use to learn about Game Strips); and there is a very large number of bug fixes and also some of the popular community requests since our public request system was revealed a few months ago.
