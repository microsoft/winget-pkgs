  2024.400 Betas bring part 2 of our changes to the release notes system, bug fixes... and soon a whole lot more!
  Changes To The Release Notes, Part 2
  - https://releases.gamemaker.io is the new home for GameMaker release notes
  - This is the planned next phase of the new release notes process, tying together all of the various places where you can find information about a new release into the one page - the notes themselves, GMLSpec changes, download links, and more
  - You can see those GameMaker releases since we moved the bug database are there already, plus the latest LTS release - going forward, all releases will use this new system
  - Along the side are the really important links for Required SDKs and also the permissions guides that you should check every time before updating
  - The milestone page is of course still available and you can click here to open for 2024.4's Milestone page directly
