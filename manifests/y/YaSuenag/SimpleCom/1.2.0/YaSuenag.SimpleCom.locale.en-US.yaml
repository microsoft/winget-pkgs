  Breaking changes
  - Use 0x05 (ENQ) as a marker for TTY Resizer - if you enable TTY Resizer on SimpleCom, 0x05 means resize request, and it does not propagate to serial session.
  - Any chars are not propagated to serial session when resize request is proceeding.
  - Any chars are replaced to NUL when resize request is proceeding
