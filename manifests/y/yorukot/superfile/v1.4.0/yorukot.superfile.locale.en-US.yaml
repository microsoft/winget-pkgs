  Click me to know how to install
  Highlights
  - We have the Zoxide Panel now. Ensure zoxide is installed on your system, set zoxide_support to true in the config, and press z to use zoxide. Image
  - File previewing is now async, meaning reduced lag while scrolling through images, or on slow systems.
  - Many bug fixes. See 'Detailed Change Summary'
  Internal Updates
  - Most file operations are now truly async with the usage of the recommended tea.Cmd pattern.
  - Enabled many new linters to improve code quality.
  - Moved golangci-lint to v2. Now developers don't need to keep the old v1 in their systems.
  - Refactored file preview in its own package for better maintainability and readability.
  - Fixed flaky unit tests.
