  Added
  - New command line option -user for changing the process UID/GID
  Changed
  - The routing algorithm has been updated with RTT-aware link costing, which should prefer lower latency links over higher latency links where possible
      - The calculated cost is an average of the link RTT, but newly established links are costed higher to begin with, such that unstable peerings can be avoided
      - Link costs are only used where multiple next-hops are available and will be ignored if there is only one loop-free path to the destination
      - This is protocol-compatible with existing v0.5.x nodes but will have the best results when peering with nodes that are also running the latest version
      - The getPeers endpoint will now report the calculated link cost for each given peer
  - Upgrade dependencies
  Fixed
  - Multicast discovery should now work again when building Yggdrasil as an Android framework
  - Multicast discovery will now correctly ignore interfaces that are not marked as running
  - Ephemeral links, such as those added by multicast, will no longer try to reconnect in a fast loop, fixing a high CPU issue
  - The TUN interface will no longer stop working when hitting a segment read error from vectorised reads
  - The AllowedPublicKeys option will once again no longer apply to multicast peerings, as was originally intended
  - A potential panic when shutting down peering links has been fixed
  - A redundant system call for setting MTU on OpenBSD has been removed
