ReleaseNotes: |-
  Added
  - The getPeers admin endpoint will now report the current transmit/receive rate for each given peer
  - The getMulticastInterfaces admin endpoint now reports much more useful information about each interface, rather than just a list of interface names
  Changed
  - Minor tweaks to the routing algorithm:
      - The next-hop selection will now prefer shorter paths when the costed distance is otherwise equal, tiebreaking on peering uptime to fall back to more stable paths
      - Link cost calculations have been smoothed out, making the costs less sensitive to sudden spikes in latency
  - Reusable name lookup and peer connection logic across different peering types for more consistent behaviour
  - Some comments in the configuration file have been revised for clarity
  - Upgrade dependencies
  Fixed
  - Nodes with IfName set to none will now correctly respond to debug RPC requests
  - The admin socket will now be created reliably before dropping privileges with -user
  - Clear supplementary groups when providing a group ID as well as a user ID to -user
  - SOCKS and WebSocket peerings should now use the correct source interface when specified in InterfacePeers
  - Peers and InterfacePeers addresses that are obviously invalid (such as unspecified or multicast addresses) will now be correctly ignored
  - Listeners should now shut down correctly, which should resolve issues where multicast listeners for specific interfaces would not come back up or would log errors
