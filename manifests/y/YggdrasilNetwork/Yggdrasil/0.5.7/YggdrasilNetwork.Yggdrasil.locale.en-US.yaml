ReleaseNotes: |-
  Added
  - WebSocket support for peerings, by using the new ws:// scheme in Listen and Peers
      - Additionally, the wss:// scheme can be used to connect to a WebSocket peer behind a HTTPS reverse proxy
  Changed
  - On Linux, the TUN adapter now uses vectorised reads/writes where possible, which should reduce the amount of CPU time spent on syscalls and potentially improve throughput
  - Link error handling has been improved and various link error messages have been rewritten to be clearer
  - Upgrade dependencies
  Fixed
  - Multiple multicast connections to the same remote machine should now work correctly
      - You may get two connections in some cases, one inbound and one outbound, this is known and will not cause problems
  - Running as a Windows service should be more reliable with service startup and shutdown bugs fixed
