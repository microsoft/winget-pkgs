ShortDescription: A powerful tool for building the contents of your CONTENTdm site.
Description: |-
  Project Client provides a range of powerful tools for building the contents of your CONTENTdm site. You can add digital items in batch using tab-delimited files, edit metadata in a spreadsheet view, easily add Compound Objects, manipulate preview images, generate OCR text, and set up templates to easily continue your workflow with specific collections.
  In Project Client, you work with "projects". Each project connects to one (and only one) collection. But you can have multiple projects connect to the same collection. For example, you can set up one project to upload all the images and another project for your PDFs.
  First, items and metadata are added to your projects. Then, they are uploaded from projects to the CONTENTdm Server. They reside in the pending queue until they are reviewed and approved by a CONTENTdm administrator. After they have been approved, the text index must be built to include the item metadata in the database so that they can be discovered by end user searches.
