ReleaseNotes: |-
  - first release in almost three years - so three years' worth of performance benefits as a result of updating from rust 1.59 to 1.76
  - fix a decryption error, which was being inadvertently caused by gm82 in the way it writes EXEs
  - add support for decompiling 810 and 811 room formats, by prepending the relevant code to room/instance creation events
