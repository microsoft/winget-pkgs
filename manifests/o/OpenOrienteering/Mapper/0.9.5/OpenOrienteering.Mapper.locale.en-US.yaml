ReleaseNotes: |-
  Enhancements
  - Mapper finally learned to export KMZ files (GH-138).
    These files can also be used as templates.
  - For organisers of MapRun or Vikazimut events, the KMZ export is complemented by a "Simple Course" export feature, turning a single line object (course) into a KML or IOF Data Standard 3.0 course file.
  - Geospatial vector data export formats can be selected explicitly, instead of relying on the filename extension (GH-1779).
  - For the Paint-on-Template feature (aka Scribbling), it is now possible to select and modify alternative colour palettes (GH-945).
  - In touch mode, the editor can ignore touch input from palm and fingers when there is an alternative pointing device (inductive stylus, mouse) (GH-1368).
  - Template data saving (GPX, paint-on-template) is more robust now (GH-1785), and error reporting is improved (GH-1790).
  - The OMAP file format preserves the order of object tags, facilitating git version control (GH-1290).
  - Minor OCD support improvements (GH-1786).
  - Translations were updated again.
  - The User Manual was restructured in order to improve the usability of the online version.
  - qtbase, Qt's key component for cross-platform support, was updated to 5.12.10 plus selected extra patches.
  Fixed bugs
  - Coordinate system issues with GeoTIFF (GH-1755).
  - Missing "datumgrid" files for precise georeferencing (GH-1802).
  - Minor OCD format improvements, including a fix for a crash (GH-1796).
  - Template saving now working for all file formats (GH-1791).
  - Consistent GPX track positioning (regression, GH-1709).
  - Area symbol patterns rotated properly when rotating the map (GH-1812), but not for North lines pattern (GH-1870).
  - Crash on early activation of GNSS location display (GH-1893).
  - ISSprOM 2019 Passable rock face symbol line width (GH-1875).
  - Symbol editing and Copy-and-paste quirks (GH-1837, GH-1828).
  - Editing values in template position dock widget (GH-1769).
  - Warnings without details at ocd import (GH-1766).
  - Windows (7 and up): You can choose between an installer (.exe) and a portable archive (.zip).
  - macOS (10.12 and up): You may need to run the app via Ctrl+Click the first time, in order to allow it to run despite coming from an "unknown source".
  - Android (4.1 and up): You can try arm64-v8a package on newer devices.  Otherwise, the armeabi-v7a package should work for most older devices.
