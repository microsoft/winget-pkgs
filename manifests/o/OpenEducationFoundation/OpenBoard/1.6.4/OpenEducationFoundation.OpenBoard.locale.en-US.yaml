ReleaseNotes: |-
  New features
  - Added the possibility to zoom using ctrl/cmd + mouse wheel, scroll up/down with mouse wheel, and scroll left/right with alt + mouse wheel, thanks to @letsfindaway
  - Updated Simplified Chinese translation, thanks to @wcxu21
  - Updated basque translations, thanks to @alexgabi
  Bug fixes
  - Fixed an issue where a PDF imported in OpenBoard, then exported as PDF, could have the original PDF inside not correctly scaled, with the help of @letsfindaway
  - Improved performance of building font model, thanks to @letsfindaway
  Known Issues
  - When Control screen is not the first screen on the left, main menu will not appear where it should.
    It is due to a Qt bug (cf. https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-84462 for more details)
  - With OpenBoard no longer able to be launched multiple times, double-clicking on an ubz file while OpenBoard is open won't open it.
  Linux
  - In Desktop Mode, Gnome Dock should be set to bottom position to workaround the issue with the Openboard left palette not beeing usable from above it (cf. https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-81341 for more details).
  macOS
  - To make a video stop playing immediately after drag'n'drop, we had to stop doing  the "play then pause" operation we usually do to load the first frame.
    This makes the player object not resizing to the size the video will occupy after clicking "play"
  - Playing a video is not working in Mac M1 with macOS 12
