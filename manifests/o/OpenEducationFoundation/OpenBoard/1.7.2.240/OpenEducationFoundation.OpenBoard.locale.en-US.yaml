ShortDescription: OpenBoard is an open source cross-platform interactive white board application designed primarily for use in schools. It was originally forked from Open-Sankoré, which was itself based on Uniboard.
ReleaseNotes: |-
  Version 1.7.2
  New features
  - Added the "Snap-to-Grid" feature, which allows the user to snap elements on the lines of the backgrounds. If no ruled/crossed background is displayed, the feature uses the crossed background setting.
  Improvements
  - Scenes are loaded on idle time of the main thread when possible
  - Improved a bit how thumbnails are handled to avoid useless and heavy operations
  - Export axes tools when exporting document to PDF
  - The current rotation angle is now displayed for any object, also for a group of objets being rotated
  - The current z-index of an object is now displayed when clicking on the layer up/down buttons.
  - It is now possible to draw on each side of the triangle
  - It is now possible to draw beyond the triangle/ruler limits
  - The rotation center is now the triangle corner instead of the 0 graduation
  - Screen gray borders are now transparent and reflects the secondary screen resolution
  - Upgraded from Qt 5 to Qt 6 on all officially supported platforms
  Bug fixes
  - Fixed a bug where annotating the first page when OpenBoard launches and exiting from the Board would make the application crash and the data lost
  - Fixed impossible to read a video on Debian
  - Dice interactivity was not working
  - Fixed several crashes

  Full Changelog: https://github.com/OpenBoard-org/OpenBoard/compare/v1.7.1...v1.7.2Known issues
  - On any widget, select options (Drop-down lists) won't appear at the right position. Be careful as it sometimes will appear behind the left or right palette of the Board Mode.
  - Still some issues with local videos and sounds
  - Some use cases remain where you can end up with documents at the same level having the same name.
  - An issue can occur, that is not clearly identified at this time, when importing an UBX, where users end up with the imported documents appearing multiple times in the documents tree, at the same level.
  Linux
  - In Desktop Mode, Gnome Dock should be set to bottom position to workaround the issue with the OpenBoard left palette not being usable from above it (cf. https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-81341 for more details).
