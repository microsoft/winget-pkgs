ReleaseNotes: >-
  - CS-Script ported to .NET 10

    - Added '-l' option for auto-selecting the latest available .NET Runtime with the call: `css -self-rt -l`

    - Added support for .NET 10 file-based execution directives: `#:package` and `#r`.

    - Changed the search dir priorities to low local overwrite of the distributed included scrips (libs): `%CSSCRIPT_INC%` is now higher than "%CSSCRIPT_ROOT%/lib`

    - In the `css.exe` status print out is now saying `<not set>` instead of `<not integrated>` for the InstallationDir field.

    It's not really about the integration but setting the CSSCRIPT_ROOT envar.

    - Updated `ProjectBuilder.GenerateProjectFor` to include the script engine assembly and global includes (e.g. `global-usings`)
