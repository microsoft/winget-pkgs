ShortDescription: opkssh is a tool which enables ssh to be used with OpenID Connect allowing SSH access management via identities like alice@example.com instead of long-lived SSH keys.
Description: opkssh is a tool which enables ssh to be used with OpenID Connect allowing SSH access management via identities like alice@example.com instead of long-lived SSH keys. It does not replace ssh, but rather generates ssh public keys that contain PK Tokens and configures sshd to verify the PK Token in the ssh public key. These PK Tokens contain standard OpenID Connect ID Tokens. This protocol builds on the OpenPubkey which adds user public keys to OpenID Connect without breaking compatibility with existing OpenID Provider.
