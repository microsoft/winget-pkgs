  New
  1. Fragmentation prediction tool: A new Results Table to display all passing sizes.1
  2. Introduced country-based product lists based on the user feedback. Please refer to this article for more information.
  3. Users can select cached country product lists when offline. More details here: Changing product lists while offline.
  4. Users can now quickly compare the actual face burden to target values across the entire face.
  Information
  1. Data can be easily copied (and transposed) and exported as CSV or Excel. A detailed tutorial can be accessed here: SHOTPlus™ Fragmentation modelling.

  Improved
  1. SHOTPlus™ now records the source for profile log data, allowing different filtering methods to apply on the data import. 1
  2. For type 2 loading rules, SHOTPlus™ now sends adjusted loading design as design to make reporting in BlastIQ™ Insights more consistent.
  3. Legacy browser support has been removed for BlastIQ™ Login Services.
  4. SHOTPlus™ displays names for initiating systems more clearly in the Available Resources list.
  5. Fragmentation prediction tool:
     - Results graph tool tip will now display decimal values for all the points on curves.
     - Clicking on a legend item now highlights the corresponding curve line and vice versa.
     - Fragmentation curve manager displays the names of curves for better management.
     - The default graphing mode will be Log/Linear to support standard practices.
  6. Display unit of measure while importing OBJ files.
  7. Implemented logical, left-to-right, top-to-bottom tab order for editable fields in the Edit Charging Rule dialog.
  8. Improved tie legend display in plans by preventing label cut-offs and accurately grouping ties by length and delay.
  Information
  1. Supported data types are RHINO, XML, LAS, Unknown.

  Fixed
  1. SHOTPlus™ encounters an import error when attempting to import a Blast from BlastIQ™.
  2. The loading factor does not persist when editing loading via the edit hole dialog.
  3. The Imperial units for rock density were incorrect for rock volume calculations.
  4. Users were experiencing issues with the 'update template' option within the Template Manager.
  5. SHOTPlus™ was not considering differences in in-hole delays when preparing lists of detonators to pick from.
  6. Boretrack data disappears when adding a Hole on the Front Row.
  7. The OBJ imports default to and convert to SI Units, regardless of the currently selected "Display Units" setting within SHOTPlus™.
  8. Blast clearance zone report not respecting imperial unit selection.
  9. When drawing a polygon, if the user selects H or V to draw a vertical line, before clicking, the line is not horizontal or vertical.
  10. Fragmentation prediction tool: The export button only exports a single curve that has been calculated, it doesn't export the ones that were imported.
  11. An issue with Energy Factor not being updated in Analytics View.
  12. The use of detonation lead lengths that are no longer available in the site's resource list.
  13. EBS field report: Fixed report totals to prevent them from incorrectly incrementing with each plan edit.
  14. Ensured consistent harness wire quantity calculations across the application, including EBS lead-in and quantities reports, by applying the surface waste parameter consistently.
  15. An error occurred after opening the Edit deck Measurement tool for the hole that has been copied.
  16. An error when syncing actual loading data via the Edit Deck Measurement tool with BlastIQ™.
