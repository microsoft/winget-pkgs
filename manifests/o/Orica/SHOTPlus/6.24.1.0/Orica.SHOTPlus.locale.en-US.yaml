  Fixed
  1. Fixed a bug that caused an error when exporting to BlastIQ™ with a SHOTPlus™ file using graphical loading rules.
  2. Resolved an issue where opening a specific SHOTPlus™ file triggered an exception.
  3. SHOTPlus™ now sends updated designs for holes with unsupported rules, e.g. loading based on MWD profile rules, by matching GUIDs instead of rule names, ensuring accurate design updates. 1
  Information
  1. Older SHOTPlus™ files will still load correctly. During this process, their rules will be assigned new GUIDs. To ensure the GUID based matching works as intended, you must run the loading rules at least once on each old file before exporting to BlastIQ™.
