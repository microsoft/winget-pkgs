ReleaseNotes: |-
  Version 6.24.1 of SHOTPlus™, first offered to users on Monday, 16th June 2025.
  A notification will appear on start-up in SHOTPlus™ once the update is available.
  For further information on updating SHOTPlus™, please contact the BlastIQ™ Support Team via support.blastiq.com.

  Important
  This update will include changes affecting forward compatibility.

  Files created in SHOTPlus™ 6.24.1 or greater will not be readable by older versions of SHOTPlus™.

  SHOTPlus™ has been migrated to the BlastIQ™ product database, where products are managed at a country and site level through the BlastIQ™ admin portal. The existing infrastructure, which supported a global region-level product list, has been retired.
  Due to the above compatibility issues it is recommended that updates of SHOTPlus™ are completed for all users, as soon as possible.
  Detailed information of these changes can be found in these Knowledge Base Articles:

  - Resolve unsupported products
  - FAQ - Product database migration

  New
  1. Users can now edit the following properties for an imported solid object to change how it is displayed 1:
     - Layer
     - Layer properties
     - Display mode
  2. Users can now choose to use a semicolon as a delimiter when exporting text files.
  3. Ability to export 'Extended firing data with cosines' with Design Loading data or Actual loading data (if available).
  4. A visual indicator system to clearly differentiate between the states of blastholes, such as design, adjusted design, and actuals, enhancing user clarity. 2
  5. Users can now submit bug reports and feedback directly from within SHOTPlus™, streamlining support with the ability to attach the current SHOTPlus™ file and a Screenshot. 3
  6. A new feature to display the blast hole angles for the front row only, allowing users to visualise and manage only the necessary holes, when all other holes are drilled at a consistent angle. 4
  Information
  1. To edit, right-click the object and Select Edit. The following properties can be modified for the object.
  2. The calculation of hole states mainly relies on BlastIQ™, using measurements captured on the bench if they are available. If not, it uses local data like the presence of decks or drill information.
  3. It’s now easier to send feedback or report a bug in SHOTPlus™. Submit using Help -> Create support ticket...

  4. Use the hole legend in the visibility manager and choose 'Angle (front row)'.

  Improved
  1. Standardised hole visualisations across all hole diagrams to display the current state, aligning with the formatting used in the Hole Table for consistent user understanding. 1
  2. Improved the SHOTPlus™ licensing system to ensure version numbers update in BlastIQ™ Admin with preactivated version updates, rather than only changing with new installations or extended activations.
  3. Standardised all font formats.
  4. Enhanced the visibility of 'Distance at Depth' in the Hole Measurement Tool by displaying it with two decimal points.
  5. Improved the comparison of the actual face burden to a target value.
  6. Row View improvement allows drill and blast engineers to quickly compare actual face burden against target values across the entire face. 2
  7. The LAS file import improvement feature ensures that colours are correctly imported, enhancing the visual representation of point clouds for files that use Point Data Record 7 or greater.
  8. Updated SHOTPlus™ fragmentation interpolation method to use OLS for consistent modelling across FRAGTrack™, BlastIQ™, and SHOTPlus™.
  Information
  1. All hole diagrams now display the current hole state.
  2. The row view face burden view enhances rapid performance assessment and decision-making. It includes the ability to enter a nominal target burden with a specified tolerance, integrated into the Row view.

  Fixed
  1. Issue with importing and viewing DTM file types.
  2. Resolved issue with importing specific DXF files using standard importer.
  3. Resolved inconsistency in displaying Hole State across different views.
  4. Resolved issue where the recording of 'Actual' initiators was causing files to be come corrupted under certain circumstances.
  5. Resolved issue where Design Length was replaced with Measured Length and/or Drilled length in SHOTPlus™ under certain circumstances.
  6. Blasthole collar icons were appearing distorted in certain circumstances.
  7. Using the Exclusion Area Tool with a mix of Design blastholes and blastholes containing measurements was causing an unhandled exception in certain circumstances.
  8. SHOTPlus™ was becoming unresponsive when displaying the 'Tie Legend' when opening files with legacy surface connector products.
  9. Saving files with legacy products was causing an unhandled exception.
  10. Fixed an issue where holes with Type 2 loading rules were being exported to BlastIQ™ with an incorrect loading design in certain circumstances. 1
  11. Strata Definition Rules: The values for RHINO data were not consistently highlighted correctly.
  12. Incorrect coordinate import issue for Georeferenced Images.
  13. Fixed an error in the Time Envelope Overview tool that caused unexpected application closure when undoing changes.
  14. A file corruption issue occurred after resolving the product conflict.
  15. Importing a LAS file results in an odd surface representation.
  16. Resolved the issue where packaged explosives with IDeX/CPeX data were missing from the product dropdown list when the 'Only show explosives with IDeX/CPeX data' filter was applied.
  17. Corrected the misalignment issue in SHOTPlus™ text export where headers did not align with columns when exporting EBS det data for holes with multiple primers.
  18. Fixed the bug where the selected hole type in the Design Data -> Hole Types dialogue didn't update with new data from an imported .hdv template.
  19. Fixed an issue where refreshing the product list for a file triggered an error.
  20. Fixed a bug that caused an error when exporting to BlastIQ™ with a SHOTPlus™ file using graphical loading rules.
  21. Fixed an intermittent issue where occasionally it was not possible to change the country product list.
  22. Resolved an issue where the selected i-kon lead lengths were not being correctly applied to the loaded holes.
  23. Resolved an issue where opening a specific SHOTPlus™ file triggered an exception.
  24. SHOTPlus™ now sends updated designs for holes with unsupported rules, e.g. loading based on MWD profile rules, by matching GUIDs instead of rule names, ensuring accurate design updates. 2
  Information
  1. Older SHOTPlus™ files will still load correctly. To ensure the rules work as intended, you must run the loading rules at least once on each old file before exporting to BlastIQ™.
  2. Old files should load correctly, and their rules will be assigned new GUIDs. To ensure the GUID test functions properly, you must run the loading rules at least once on an old file.
