ReleaseNotes: |-
  Version 2.22.2 of SHOTPlus™ Tunnel, first offered to users on Thursday 11th January, 2024.
  A notification will appear on start-up in SHOTPlus™ Tunnel once the update is available.
  For further information on updating the SHOTPlus™, please contact the BlastIQ™ Support Team via support.blastiq.com.

  Supporting ongoing improvements to SHOTPlus™
  SHOTPlus™ will be undergoing a database transition to complete an upgrade of its services to the BlastIQ™ platform.
  In order to make this transition as smooth as possible for our users, some changes will be implemented to collect information about which products are being used within SHOTPlus™ files. This data will be collected for at least a 90 day period. This information will only be used internally to ensure that all products in use are available on the BlastIQ™ Platform when the service transition takes place.
  This will be implemented in SHOTPlus™ Tunnel Beta v2.21.7 and greater.
  It is strongly recommended that you upgrade to this version when it is available.
  If you do not upgrade to these versions when they become available, you may experience disruptions when the service upgrade takes place.
