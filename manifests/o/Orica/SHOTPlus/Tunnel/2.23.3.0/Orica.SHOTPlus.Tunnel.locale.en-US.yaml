ReleaseNotes: |-
  Version 2.23.3 of SHOTPlus™ Tunnel, first offered to users on Tuesday, 8th July 2025.
  A notification will appear on start-up in SHOTPlus™ Tunnel once the update is available.
  For further information on updating SHOTPlus™, please contact the BlastIQ™ Support Team via support.blastiq.com.

  Important
  Update to SHOTPlus™ Tunnel Support Policy
  There has been an update to the support policy for SHOTPlus™ Tunnel. Support will be provided for the current version, with a buffer of 60 days for the previous version to allow time to update.
  For more information on this update, please refer to this article.

  New
  1. Users will no longer able to license SHOTPlus™ Tunnel with product keys.
  2. "Hole Type Names" are now able to be exported via text export.
  3. "Decking mode" in the eDev™ timing tool is no longer supported .1
  4. A new GUID parameter is generated each time File > Export > All MDCU charge files is run support changes to the WebGen™ workflow.2
  5. Users can now export local collar coordinates via Text Export.
  6. There are now two volume calculations in Calculations > Performance Indicators:
     1. "Blast volume" is the profile cross-section area multiplied by the hole length.
     2. "Blast volume (hole based)" is the sum of the calculated volume per hole.
  Information
  1. "Decking mode" was a specialised tool used for a specific use case in civil tunneling. Users are still able to use eDev™ in holes with multiple decks without "Decking mode".
  2. The GUID will be made available to copy from the confirmation dialog box once file export is complete. A new code is generated each time the MDCU files are created. Users can check the current GUID via "Blast header information" in Blast Properties.

  Improved
  1. The old print functionality has been retired as part of the SHOTPlus print standardization across the SHOTPlus suite. 1
  2. In 'Program Settings,' >'BlastIQ™ Online Settings', is now renamed to 'NCVIB Server' to more accurately describe the pane's function.
  3. The "Void" hole type now accurately displays the hole diameter in the main window.
  4. Improved messaging for timing decked holes using eDev™.
  5. When using the eDev™ tool, holes with multiple decks and detonators are being counted correctly.
  6. Users exporting files for MDCU charge plans can now use an ejection charge > 0.2kg.
  7. Increased range of hole angles:
     1. In Horizontal/Vertical mode: the horizontal and vertical angles are valid within the range (-80°, 80°).2
     2. In Angle/Bearing mode: the angle values are valid within the range (0°, 80°).
  Information
  1. For further information about the new print functionality please refer to the KBA.
  2. When an angle is greater than 80° approaching 90°, the mathematical calculations exceed the limits of the model.

  Fixed
  1. The 'Remove Timing' function in the Tools > Holes menu, now re-named 'Remove in-hole initiation', was not operating as designed.
  2. Dimension text labels now align with the plan view during printing.
  3. The "Retain existing timing function", was not performing after loading design was emptied and reapplied.
  4. The Cut Tool template editor now applies EBS timing and displays the EBS toolbar correctly.
  5. The 'Edit Template' and 'Delete Template' options in the Cut Tool template window now function correctly upon template import.
  6. The Hole tool now reflects the applied program unit settings.
  7. Summary block was not printing properly.
  8. Deleted profiles were appearing the Project Overview tool.
  9. Main window refresh was delayed when hole type colours were changed.
  10. When importing a cut template, all objects will now be stored in the "Cut" layer.
  11. SHOTPlus™ Tunnel was not importing as-drilled holes correctly.
  12. SHOTPlus™ Tunnel was incorrectly counting the number of as-drilled holes in Project Overview.
  13. Deleting a cut template from a project was causing an error.
  14. When using the Dimension tool in the Cut Editor, dimension objects were not automatically being stored in the Dimension layer.
  15. SHOTPlus™ Tunnel was not allowing users to create blasted sections using a DXF.
