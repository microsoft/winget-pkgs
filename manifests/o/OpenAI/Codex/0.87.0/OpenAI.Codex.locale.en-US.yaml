ReleaseNotes: |-
  New Features
  - User message metadata (text elements and byte ranges) now round-trips through protocol/app-server/core so UI annotations can survive history rebuilds. (#9331)
  - Collaboration wait calls can block on multiple IDs in one request, simplifying multi-thread coordination. (#9294)
  - User shell commands now run under the user snapshot so aliases and shell config are honored. (#9357)
  - The TUI now surfaces approval requests from spawned/unsubscribed threads. (#9232)
  Bug Fixes
  - Token estimation during compaction is now accurate, improving budgeting during long sessions. (#9337)
  - MCP CallToolResult now includes threadId in both content and structuredContent, and returns a defined output schema for compatibility. (#9338)
  - The TUI “Worked for” separator only appears after actual work has occurred. (#8958)
  - Piped non-PTY commands no longer hang waiting on stdin. (#9369)
  Documentation
  - MCP interface docs updated to reflect structured output schema and threadId behavior. (#9338)
  Chores
  - Windows builds enable the PowerShell UTF-8 feature by default. (#9195)
