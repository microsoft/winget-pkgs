ReleaseNotes: |-
  New Features
  - Memory files now include the working directory in stored context, improving memory behavior when switching between different project directories. (#11591)
  Bug Fixes
  - Model resolution now preserves the requested model slug when selecting by prefix, so model references stay stable instead of being rewritten. (#11602)
  - Developer messages are now excluded from phase-1 memory input, reducing noisy or irrelevant content entering memory. (#11608)
  - Memory phase processing concurrency was reduced to make consolidation/staging more stable under load. (#11614)
  Chores
  - Cleaned and simplified the phase-1 memory pipeline code paths. (#11605)
  - Minor repository maintenance: formatting and test-suite hygiene updates in remote model tests. (#11619)
