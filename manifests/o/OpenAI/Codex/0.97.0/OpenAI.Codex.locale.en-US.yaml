ReleaseNotes: |-
  New Features
  - Added a session-scoped “Allow and remember” option for MCP/App tool approvals, so repeated calls to the same tool can be auto-approved during the session. (#10584)
  - Added live skill update detection, so skill file changes are picked up without restarting. (#10478)
  - Added support for mixed text and image content in dynamic tool outputs for app-server integrations. (#10567)
  - Added a new /debug-config slash command in the TUI to inspect effective configuration. (#10642)
  - Introduced initial memory plumbing (API client + local persistence) to support thread memory summaries. (#10629, #10634)
  - Added configurable log_dir so logs can be redirected (including via -c overrides) more easily. (#10678)
  Bug Fixes
  - Fixed jitter in the TUI apps/connectors picker by stabilizing description-column rendering. (#10593)
  - Restored and stabilized the TUI “working” status indicator/shimmer during preamble and early exec flows. (#10700, #10701)
  - Improved cloud requirements reliability with higher timeouts, retries, and corrected precedence over MDM settings. (#10631, #10633, #10659)
  - Persisted pending-input user events more consistently for mid-turn injected input handling. (#10656)
  Documentation
  - Documented how to opt in to the experimental app-server API. (#10667)
  - Updated docs/schema coverage for new log_dir configuration behavior. (#10678)
  Chores
  - Added a gated Bubblewrap (bwrap) Linux sandbox path to improve filesystem isolation options. (#9938)
  - Refactored model client lifecycle to be session-scoped and reduced implicit client state. (#10595, #10664)
  - Added caching for MCP actions from apps to reduce repeated load latency for users with many installed apps. (#10662)
  - Added a none personality option in protocol/config surfaces. (#10688)
