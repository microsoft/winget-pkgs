  Highlights
  Improved MCP support
  We are in the middle of significantly improving support for connecting to MCP servers including support for streamable http servers with optional bearer token or oauth login support.
  Enable the experimental_use_rmcp_client = true flag in config.toml to use the new MCP stack. If you encounter issues, create a GitHub issue and add the mcp label. We would like to remove the experimental flag soon and will continue to expand MCP support over time.
