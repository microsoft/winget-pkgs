ReleaseNotes: |-
  New Features
  - Added WS_PROXY/WSS_PROXY environment support (including lowercase variants) for websocket proxying in the network proxy. (#11784)
  - App-server v2 now emits notifications when threads are archived or unarchived, enabling clients to react without polling. (#12030)
  - Protocol/core now carry distinct approval IDs for command approvals to support multiple approvals within a single shell command execution flow. (#12051)
  Bug Fixes
  - Ctrl+C/Ctrl+D now cleanly exits the cwd-change prompt during resume/fork flows instead of implicitly selecting an option. (#12040)
  - Reduced false-positive safety-check downgrade behavior by relying on the response header model (and websocket top-level events) rather than the response body model slug. (#12061)
  Documentation
  - Updated docs and schemas to cover websocket proxy configuration, new thread archive/unarchive notifications, and the command approval ID plumbing. (#11784, #12030, #12051)
  Chores
  - Made the Rust release workflow resilient to npm publish attempts for an already-published version. (#12044)
  - Standardized remote compaction test mocking and refreshed related snapshots to align with the default production-shaped behavior. (#12050)
