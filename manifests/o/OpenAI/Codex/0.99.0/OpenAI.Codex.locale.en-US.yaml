ReleaseNotes: |-
  New Features
  - Running direct shell commands no longer interrupts an in-flight turn; commands can execute concurrently when a turn is active. (#10513)
  - Added /statusline to configure which metadata appears in the TUI footer interactively. (#10546)
  - The TUI resume picker can now toggle sort order between creation time and last-updated time with an in-picker mode indicator. (#10752)
  - App-server clients now get dedicated APIs for steering active turns, listing experimental features, resuming agents, and opting out of specific notifications. (#10721, #10821, #10903, #11319)
  - Enterprise/admin requirements can now restrict web search modes and define network constraints through requirements.toml. (#10964, #10958)
  - Image attachments now accept GIF and WebP inputs in addition to existing formats. (#11237)
  Bug Fixes
  - Fixed a Windows startup issue where buffered keypresses could cause the TUI sign-in flow to exit immediately. (#10729)
  - Required MCP servers now fail fast during start/resume flows instead of continuing in a broken state. (#10902)
  - Fixed a file-watcher bug that emitted spurious skills reload events and could generate very large log files. (#11217)
  - Improved TUI input reliability: long option labels wrap correctly, Tab submits in steer mode when idle, history recall keeps cursor placement consistent, and stashed drafts restore image placeholders correctly. (#11123, #10035, #11295, #9040)
  - Fixed model-modality edge cases by surfacing clearer view_image errors on text-only models and stripping unsupported image history during model switches. (#11336, #11349)
  - Reduced false approval mismatches for wrapped/heredoc shell commands and guarded against empty command lists in exec policy evaluation. (#10941, #11397)
  Documentation
  - Expanded app-server docs and protocol references for turn/steer, experimental-feature discovery, resume_agent, notification opt-outs, and null developer_instructions normalization. (#10721, #10821, #10903, #10983, #11319)
  - Updated TUI composer docs to reflect draft/image restoration, steer-mode Tab submit behavior, and history-navigation cursor semantics. (#9040, #10035, #11295)
  Chores
  - Reworked npm release packaging so platform-specific binaries are distributed via @openai/codex dist-tags, reducing package-size pressure while preserving platform-specific installs (including @alpha). (#11318, #11339)
  - Pulled in a security-driven dependency update for time (RUSTSEC-2026-0009). (#10876)
