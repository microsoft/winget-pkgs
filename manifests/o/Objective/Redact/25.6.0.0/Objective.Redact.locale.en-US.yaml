ShortDescription: Redaction software for security conscious organisations. Protect yourself and your organisation from accidental disclosure.
Description: |-
  It’s an awful feeling when, after manually redacting a document, you can’t help but wonder if you’ve got every word. Yes, “find and replace” works, but only to a certain point. Hidden metadata may still be lurking in your document.
  Protect yourself and your organization from accidental disclosure. Objective Redact is a powerful, automated redaction software that makes redaction much faster, internal review much simpler, and keeps your most sensitive information safe.
  Ideal for compliance and disclosure processes, Objective Redact quickly and easily redacts information, no matter how large or complex your documents are.
