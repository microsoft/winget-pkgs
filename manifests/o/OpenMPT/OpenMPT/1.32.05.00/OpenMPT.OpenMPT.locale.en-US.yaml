ShortDescription: A powerful audio application that makes writing music fun, easy and efficient.
Description: |-
  OpenMPT is a popular tracker software for Windows. OpenMPT (short hand for Open ModPlug Tracker) is completely free and allows you to create and play back some great music on your computer. Based on the original ModPlug Tracker written by Olivier Lapicque, OpenMPT is free software, can import a wide variety of module formats and offers an intuitive, native GUI as well as advanced features such as VST plugins and ASIO output.
  In addition to its own song format, OpenMPT can natively edit Impulse Tracker, FastTracker, Scream Tracker and ProTracker module files. Read more about it on the features page!

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Pattern tab
  - [Fix] <js> Since OpenMPT 1.31, having both "Contiunous scroll" and "Cursor wrap in pattern editor" disabled, jumping by beat or measure no longer jumped to the first or last row of the pattern and instead stayed on the current row if it was close to the start / end than a beat / measure (http://forum.openmpt.org/index.php?topic=7374.0).
  - [Fix] <js> Transposing a selection didn't refresh the (potentially changed) default volume display if the selection of the last channel didn't contain the volume column.
  - [Fix] <js> Automatically hiding the volume column didn't work for newly-created MODs (http://bugs.openmpt.org/view.php?id=1928).

  Sample tab
  - [New] <js> Added option to slice a sample at grid points instead of cue points, including a keyboard shortcut (http://forum.openmpt.org/index.php?topic=7376.0).
  - [Fix] <js> Since OpenMPT 1.31.14.00, fine adjustment of sustain loop start / end was broken.

  Instrument tab
  - [Fix] <js> Sample Map dialog: Fixed font scaling in the keyboard display when moving the window between screens with different DPI settings.

  IT
  - [Mod] <js> Files are no longer interpreted as ModPlug-made (thus disabling all compatibility settings) just because instrument extensions are found (no such files are currently known to exist in the wild).

  Third-Party Libraries
  - [Imp] Update ancient (v2.3.0), mpg123 (v1.33.3) and unrar(v7.2.1)
