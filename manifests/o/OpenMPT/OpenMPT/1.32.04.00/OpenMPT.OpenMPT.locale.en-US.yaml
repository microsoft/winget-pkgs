ShortDescription: A powerful audio application that makes writing music fun, easy and efficient.
Description: |-
  OpenMPT is a popular tracker software for Windows. OpenMPT (short hand for Open ModPlug Tracker) is completely free and allows you to create and play back some great music on your computer. Based on the original ModPlug Tracker written by Olivier Lapicque, OpenMPT is free software, can import a wide variety of module formats and offers an intuitive, native GUI as well as advanced features such as VST plugins and ASIO output.
  In addition to its own song format, OpenMPT can natively edit Impulse Tracker, FastTracker, Scream Tracker and ProTracker module files. Read more about it on the features page!

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Pattern tab
  - [Fix] <js> Find & Replace: Selecting a Transpose value of -4 or -5 caused the replace tab to assume that the replacement note was a PC event (tx cs127).
  - [Fix] <js> Find & Replace: When finding a PC event and replacing it with a regular note, the instrument / volume fields were not always updated correctly (tx cs127).
  - [Fix] <js> Quick Channel Settings: Avoid keyboard focus trap when navigating to the first or last channel and the keyboard focus was on one of the previous / next channel controls.
  - [Fix] <js> The order list focus rectangle was sometimes not drawn with the correct colors.

  Sample tab
  - [Imp] <js> Added keyboard shortcuts for toggling loop types (http://forum.openmpt.org/index.php?topic=7354.0).
  - [Fix] <js> Sample slicing did not adjust the sustain loop points in the sliced samples, and did not reset the "Keep sample on disk" setting.

  IT
  - [Fix] <js> Even when the filter cutoff envelope is stopped before its first tick is applied, the filter should still be activated (http://bugs.openmpt.org/view.php?id=1914).

  Audio I/O
  - [Fix] <js> It was possible that OpenMPT could crash when stopping playback of a module when using bridged plugins in combination with certain ASIO drivers, likely since OpenMPT 1.31.10.00 (tx coda).

  Misc
  - [Imp] <js> Quick Start Dialog: Collapsed status of item groups is now memorized (http://bugs.openmpt.org/view.php?id=1916).
  - [Imp] <jh> On Windows XP and Wine 3.12 and older, messages with "don't show again" option now offer control over whether they should be shown again.
  - [Imp] <jh> Wine integration now supports RtAudio 6.
  - [Imp] <js> Several numeric input fields no longer allow arbitrary text to be entered into them.
  - [Mod] <js> In export dialogs, the currently active subsong is now chosen for export by default.
  - [Fix] <jh> Wine integration was broken on Wine 10.13 due to a Wine regression.

  Third-Party Libraries
  - [Imp] Update lhasa (v0.5.0), mpg123 (v1.33.2) and unrar(v7.1.10)
