Description: |-
  OpenMPT is a popular tracker software for Windows. OpenMPT (short hand for Open ModPlug Tracker) is completely free and allows you to create and play back some great music on your computer. Based on the original ModPlug Tracker written by Olivier Lapicque, OpenMPT is free software, can import a wide variety of module formats and offers an intuitive, native GUI as well as advanced features such as VST plugins and ASIO output.
  In addition to its own song format, OpenMPT can natively edit Impulse Tracker, FastTracker, Scream Tracker and ProTracker module files. Read more about it on the features page!

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Sample tab
  - [Imp] <js> Relaxed BRR file rejection heuristics a bit (http://bugs.openmpt.org/view.php?id=1859).
  - [Imp] <js> Loop and cue point information is now also copied for sample selections (http://bugs.openmpt.org/view.php?id=1869).
  - [Fix] <js> Possible crash when replacing a sample with a shorter one while outside of the sample editor, and then returning to the same sample slot (http://bugs.openmpt.org/view.php?id=1866).
  - [Fix] <js> Drawing sample data from right to left caused the drawn lines to not be interpolated properly.

  Instrument tab
  - [Fix] <js> Fixed crash when trying to remove the only point of an envelope.

  Misc
  - [Fix] <js> If multiple keyboard layouts were installed, note key mapping could be based on the wrong layout, causing e.g. B-4 and Note-Off keys to be swapped on the default key map with an active US keyboard layout but also a German layout being present.

  Third-Party Libraries
  - [Imp] Update FLAC (v1.5.0)
