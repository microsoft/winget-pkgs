ShortDescription: A powerful audio application that makes writing music fun, easy and efficient.
Description: |-
  OpenMPT is a popular tracker software for Windows. OpenMPT (short hand for Open ModPlug Tracker) is completely free and allows you to create and play back some great music on your computer. Based on the original ModPlug Tracker written by Olivier Lapicque, OpenMPT is free software, can import a wide variety of module formats and offers an intuitive, native GUI as well as advanced features such as VST plugins and ASIO output.
  In addition to its own song format, OpenMPT can natively edit Impulse Tracker, FastTracker, Scream Tracker and ProTracker module files. Read more about it on the features page!

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Tree view
  - [Imp] <js> Add option to open modules and instrument library entries in Explorer through the context menu (http://bugs.openmpt.org/view.php?id=677).
  - [Fix] <js> The folder browser could not handle paths longer than 260 characters.

  Pattern tab
  - [Fix] <js> Special note keys (Note Cut / Off / Fade / PC / PCs) were not available in the default key map on various keyboard layouts (http://bugs.openmpt.org/view.php?id=1838).
  - [Fix] <js> When partially pasting a normal pattern event over a PC event, the effect column was not erased properly if it wasn't part of the copied region.
  - [Fix] <js> When evaluating MIDI macros containing letters "u" or "v" during seeking, the initial global volume was applied to them, rather than the global volume that would be reached at that pattern position.

  Instrument tab
  - [Imp] <js> When moving the last envelope point, avoid it snapping back quickly when moving backwards (http://bugs.openmpt.org/view.php?id=297).
  - [Imp] <js> Show tooltips for disabled envelope toolbar buttons, and show the button name in the toolbar.
  - [Fix] <js> When importing a soundfont instrument, its bank number was off by one (http://bugs.openmpt.org/view.php?id=1842).

  Mod Conversion
  - [Imp] <js> Improve handling of the transpose = -1 / finetune = 0 case when converting samples from another format to MOD. This combination is now automatically translated to finetune = -8.

  IT
  - [Imp] <js> Don't report files claiming to be made with Impulse Tracker 2.08+ as IT-made if they have no edit timer.
  - [Fix] <js> Ignore sample data in slots that don't have the "sample data present" flag set, if the file vaguely looks IT-made to avoid playing garbage caused by an Impulse Tracker bug that should not be audible (http://www.un4seen.com/forum/?topic=20542.0).

  S3M
  - [Imp] <js> Detect early Schism Tracker versions.

  MOD
  - [Imp] <js> When trying to detect MOD files with broken order lists, the file size is now rounded down to an even number. This helps identifying some malformed files (MOD files can technically not have an odd size).
  - [Fix] <js> Also enable ProTracker-compatible tremolo ramp waveform for M!K! modules.
  - [Fix] <js> In ProTracker 1/2 mode, retrigger with instrument-less notes now keeps using the previous sample offset.

  Other formats
  - [Imp] <js> Warn when Startrekker AM companion file for synthesized instruments is most likely missing.
  - [Imp] DBM / IMF / MED: When merging pattern commands, allow to move offset to volume column at the expense of a lower offset resolution. Slightly improves playback of ShowMeLove.med (http://www.un4seen.com/forum/?topic=15448.msg144136#msg144136).
  - [Fix] <js> MED: Fix correct octave transposition in some MED files that have hardware mixing disabled but sample transpose enabled. Fixed Journey.med (http://www.un4seen.com/forum/?topic=15448.msg143713#msg143713).
  - [Fix] <js> MED: Don't enable Amiga resampler if any stereo samples are found, as it does not support stereo samples (http://www.un4seen.com/forum/?topic=15448.msg144058#msg144058).
  - [Fix] <js> MED: Fix tempo in some files using software mixing mode and legacy tempo values (http://www.un4seen.com/forum/?topic=15448.msg144080#msg144080).
  - [Fix] <js> MED: Avoid importing effect memory for some commands (http://www.un4seen.com/forum/?topic=15448.msg144131#msg144131).
  - [Fix] <js> MED: Retrigger with instrument-less note now keeps using the previous sample offset. Fixes Kris Hadalot.med (http://www.un4seen.com/forum/?topic=15448.msg144130#msg144130).
  - [Fix] <js> MED: Disable sample swapping on notes with portamento, and don't resume stopped notes with portamento. Fixes Homeward_Trek.med by Soundburst (http://www.un4seen.com/forum/?topic=15448.msg144148#msg144148).
  - [Fix] <js> MED: Only use 7-bit volume commands in MMD3 files made with a new enough version of MED Soundstudio.
  - [Fix] <js> STM: Do not sanitize sample loop data. Scream Tracker 2 reads into the next sample's data when loops exceed the sample length (http://www.un4seen.com/forum/?topic=15448.msg144130#msg144130).

  Module cleanup
  - [Fix] <js> Possible crash when searching for unused samples if an instrument refers to a non-existing sample slot.

  Misc
  - [Imp] <js> Added the possibility to disable enhanced GDI upscaling via hidden setting "Display.UseGDIUpcaling". This may fix freezes when opening the editors of some older VST plugins when this mode is enabled (http://bugs.openmpt.org/view.php?id=1524).
  - [Imp] <js> Channel Manager: Channel buttons now have tooltips.
  - [Mod] <js> When enabling the "Display.HighResUI" option, OpenMPT claimed to support per-monitor awareness. This was not really usable, so OpenMPT now only claims to support one system-wide DPI setting.
  - [Mod] <js> Auto save no longer uses relative paths for external samples when auto saving to a user-specified folder.
  - [Fix] <js> MIDI recording: Velocity amplification was rounded down to integer multiples of 100% (http://bugs.openmpt.org/view.php?id=1835).
  - [Fix] <js> After loading a module with missing external samples, OpenMPT still prompted to save those empty sample slots to disk when closing the module. Doing that resulted in a crash.
  - [Fix] <js> Fix truncated display of first item in checkbox lists in particular "Display.HighResUI" enabled. Potentially also fixes http://bugs.openmpt.org/view.php?id=1480
  - [Fix] <js> When changing a shortcut via a search that had results in multiple contexts, a wrong context could be assigned to the shortcut.
  - [Fix] <js> File/Append shortcut didn't work.
  - [Fix] <js> Cleaning up auto save files, scanning for missing samples or creating the list of templates or example songs in paths longer than 260 characters did not work.
  - [Fix] <ze> When saving a copy of a module, its modified status is no longer reset (http://bugs.openmpt.org/view.php?id=1843).
  - [Fix] <js> On Windows XP, the advanced settings list was not formatted correctly.
