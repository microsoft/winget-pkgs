ShortDescription: A powerful audio application that makes writing music fun, easy and efficient.
Description: |-
  OpenMPT is a popular tracker software for Windows. OpenMPT (short hand for Open ModPlug Tracker) is completely free and allows you to create and play back some great music on your computer. Based on the original ModPlug Tracker written by Olivier Lapicque, OpenMPT is free software, can import a wide variety of module formats and offers an intuitive, native GUI as well as advanced features such as VST plugins and ASIO output.
  In addition to its own song format, OpenMPT can natively edit Impulse Tracker, FastTracker, Scream Tracker and ProTracker module files. Read more about it on the features page!

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Pattern tab
  - [Fix] <js> Upon data entry, the status bar display was not updated unless playback was running.
  - [Fix] <js> Fixed potential crash when trying to move the cursor past the start or end of a pattern when the order list is empty (http://bugs.openmpt.org/view.php?id=1854).

  Sample tab
  - [Imp] <js> Pressing Ctrl while moving loop points or clicking loop start / end spin buttons now moves the loop, keeping the loop length constant.
  - [Imp] <js> Cue preview shortcuts now set the cue point if it's currently unused and the sample is being previewed (http://bugs.openmpt.org/view.php?id=1852).
  - [Fix] <js> Time stretching didn't update cue points.

  Playback
  - [Fix] <js> Default velocity for instrument plugins was broken in OpenMPT 1.31.13.00 (tx coda).
  - [Fix] <js> MIDI Macros: An unfinished byte right before an "s" SysEx checksum macro letter was not considered in the checksum.
  - [Fix] <js> Avoid NNA channel starvation due to sample-based instruments that have a MIDI channel assigned and NNA set to "Continue". It can still happen if a VST plugin or the MIDI I/O plugin is associated with the instrument. Other built-in plugins are not affected (http://bugs.openmpt.org/view.php?id=1848).

  XM
  - [Imp] <js> Warn when saving an instrument that references more than 16 (compatibility export) or 32 samples (http://bugs.openmpt.org/view.php?id=1846).
  - [Imp] <js> Identify XMs saved with Digitrakker that were converted from other formats.
  - [Fix] <js> In non-compatible linear slide mode, the sample rate could wrap around with portamento slides to extremely low frequencies. This should only happen in compatible mode.

  Other formats
  - [Imp] <js> MO3: XM dummy command W is now imported.
  - [Fix] <js> ITP: Instruments paths were always read as relative paths since OpenMPT 1.31.01.00, usually causing them to fail to load.
  - [Fix] <js> ITP: Since OpenMPT 1.28.01.00, instrument and envelope flags were no longer read correctly.

  Misc
  - [Imp] <js> Fine tempo adjustment shortcuts now also work with formats that don't support fractional tempo.
  - [Imp] <js> "Find MPT Hacks" now warns when an XM instrument uses more than 16 samples (http://bugs.openmpt.org/view.php?id=1846).
  - [Fix] <js> Passing a relative path to a module file as a command-line parameter for OpenMPT did not work as intended since OpenMPT 1.29.10.00.
  - [Fix] <js> Real BPM approximation reported infinity when rows per beat was set to 0. A default of 4 rows per beat is now assumed in this situation.
  - [Fix] <js> Advanced Settings: It was not possible to enter fractional values for settings of type float with system locales using a decimal separator other than ".".

  Third-Party Libraries
  - [Imp] Update mpg123 (v1.32.10) and unrar (v7.1.2).
