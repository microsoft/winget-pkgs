ShortDescription: A powerful audio application that makes writing music fun, easy and efficient.
Description: |-
  OpenMPT is a popular tracker software for Windows. OpenMPT (short hand for Open ModPlug Tracker) is completely free and allows you to create and play back some great music on your computer. Based on the original ModPlug Tracker written by Olivier Lapicque, OpenMPT is free software, can import a wide variety of module formats and offers an intuitive, native GUI as well as advanced features such as VST plugins and ASIO output.
  In addition to its own song format, OpenMPT can natively edit Impulse Tracker, FastTracker, Scream Tracker and ProTracker module files. Read more about it on the features page!

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Sample tab
  - [Imp] <js> Shift-clicking the loop start / end spin buttons now moves the loop points finely, instead of snapping to the next self-similar point (tx Platonist).
  - [Fix] <js> Using Shift to move loop or cue points when zoomed into the sample actually accelerated mouse movement, so it was no longer "fine" movement as intended.

  Other formats
  - [Fix] <js> PT36: Some MODs with samples larger than 64k inside PT36 containers were not read correctly (tx AliceLR).

  Stream Export
  - [Fix] <js> Exporting the same module multiple times (or exporting individual instruments / channels) could lead to files differing in length by one sample when using modern tempo mode.

  Misc
  - [Fix] <jh> Fixed crash when saving IT / MPTM files and shutting down OpenMPT on Wine 10.20 and potentially Wine 11.1 (http://bugs.openmpt.org/view.php?id=1933).
  - [Fix] <js> MIDI Export: Choosing the percussion channel for an instrument and then keeping "Mapped" mode selected and never manually touching the dropdown menu resulted in wrong MIDI percussion notes to be exported.
