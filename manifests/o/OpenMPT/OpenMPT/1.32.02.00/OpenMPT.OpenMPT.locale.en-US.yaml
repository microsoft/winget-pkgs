ShortDescription: A powerful audio application that makes writing music fun, easy and efficient.
Description: |-
  OpenMPT is a popular tracker software for Windows. OpenMPT (short hand for Open ModPlug Tracker) is completely free and allows you to create and play back some great music on your computer. Based on the original ModPlug Tracker written by Olivier Lapicque, OpenMPT is free software, can import a wide variety of module formats and offers an intuitive, native GUI as well as advanced features such as VST plugins and ASIO output.
  In addition to its own song format, OpenMPT can natively edit Impulse Tracker, FastTracker, Scream Tracker and ProTracker module files. Read more about it on the features page!

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Tree view
  - [Fix] <js> Since OpenMPT 1.32.01.00, the MIDI input focus remained on the tree view after dragging an instrument to a sample or instrument editor, while keyboard input focus was on the editor (http://bugs.openmpt.org/view.php?id=1899).

  Pattern tab
  - [Imp] <js> Added keyboard shortcuts for expanding and shrinking patterns (default: Ctrl + Alt + E / D).

  Sample tab
  - [Imp] <jh> FLAC encoding can now be configured to be multithreaded, using all available CPU cores, by toggling the hidden setting "Sample Editor.FLACMultithreading".

  Instrument tab
  - [Fix] <cs127> When saving an ITI file, parts of the volume envelope were damaged (http://github.com/OpenMPT/openmpt/pull/32).
  - [Fix] <js> Switching between envelopes using keyboard shortcuts didn't update accessible announcements (http://bugs.openmpt.org/view.php?id=1892).

  Playback
  - [Fix] <js> Previewing a sample, instrument or pattern note after pausing playback in a module using synth instruments continued playing those synth instruments (tx squeaktoy).

  MPTM
  - [Fix] <js> Inserting / duplicating / moving sequences reset the default tempo and speed for all sequences (http://forum.openmpt.org/index.php?topic=7345.0).

  IT
  - [Fix] <js> Picking up a note after a Note Cut effect through a lone instrument number restores the original note pitch without any portamento slides, as if there was a note.
  - [Fix] <js> If there is a note and a tone portamento next to a Note Cut effect, the Note Cut is not executed - unless there is also a row delay effect and we are on the second repetition of the row.

  S3M
  - [Mod] <js> Old ModPlug Tracker versions allowed to use the 28th character of sample names to be used. Such sample names are now displayed correctly again.

  Other formats
  - [Fix] <js> MED: When triggering a synth note with a Synth Jump command on the same row, the initial speed command was not executed (http://www.un4seen.com/forum/?msg=145046).

  Stream Export
  - [Imp] <js> The currently active subsong is now selected by default for the single subsong export mode, subsong field for single-subsong export to the currently edited subsong. This also applies to OPL and MIDI export (http://forum.openmpt.org/index.php?topic=7340.0).
  - [Imp] <js> In export dialogs, the song index within the selected sequence is now also shown (http://forum.openmpt.org/index.php?topic=7340.0).
  - [Imp] <jh> FLAC encoding is now multithreaded by default, using all available CPU cores. Can be disabled by toggling the hidden setting "Export.FLACMultithreading".

  Misc
  - [Imp] <js> Main toolbar: Icon groups can now be hidden as well. At least one icon group needs to be always visible, though (http://bugs.openmpt.org/view.php?id=1889).
  - [Imp] <js> Added help button to Setup dialog title bar.
  - [Imp] <js> A few more icons are now inverted when using dark themes.
  - [Imp] <js> Added a default key binding for Toggle Between Upper / Lower View (Ctrl + Shift + Tab).
  - [Imp] <js> TCB has been added to list of recognized file extensions for TCB Tracker modules. Both ModLand and Fujiology use .TCB instead of the canonical .MOD extension.
  - [Fix] <js> Estimate Song Length: Subsong start order format was not adhering to the "Display rows / orders in hex" setting.
  - [Fix] <js> Large parts of the GUI were broken in XP / Vista builds when running them on Windows 10 version 1607 or newer. (http://bugs.openmpt.org/view.php?id=1887).
  - [Fix] <js> On Windows XP / Vista and Wine versions older 3.13, message boxes there were supposed to only show once were always shown instead.

  Third-Party Libraries
  - [Imp] Update miniz (v3.0.2), mpg123 (v1.33.0) and ogg (v1.3.6)
