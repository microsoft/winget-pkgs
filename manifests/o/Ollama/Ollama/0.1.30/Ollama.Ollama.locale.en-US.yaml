ReleaseNotes: |-
  New models
  - Command R: a Large Language Model optimized for conversational interaction and long context tasks.
  - mxbai-embed-large: A new state-of-the-art large embedding model
  What's Changed
  - Fixed various issues with ollama run on Windows
      - History now will work when pressing up and down arrow keys
      - Right and left arrow keys will now move the cursor appropriately
      - Pasting multi-line strings will now work on Windows
  - Fixed issue where mounting or sharing files between Linux and Windows (e.g. via WSL or Docker) would cause errors due to having : in the filename.
  - Improved support for AMD MI300 and MI300X Accelerators
  - Improved cleanup of temporary files resulting in better space utilization
  Important changeFor filesystem compatibility, Ollama has changed model data filenames to use - instead of :. This change will be applied automatically. If downgrading to 0.1.29 or lower from 0.1.30 (on Linux or macOS only) run:

  find ~/.ollama/models/blobs -type f -exec bash -c 'mv "$0" "${0//-/:}"' {} \;
