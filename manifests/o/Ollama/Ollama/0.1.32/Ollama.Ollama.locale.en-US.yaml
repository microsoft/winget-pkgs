  What's Changed
  - Ollama will now better utilize available VRAM, leading to less out-of-memory errors, as well as better GPU utilization
  - When running larger models that don't fit into VRAM on macOS, Ollama will now split the model between GPU and CPU to maximize performance.
  - Fixed several issues where Ollama would hang upon encountering an error
  - Fix issue where using quotes in OLLAMA_ORIGINS would cause an error
