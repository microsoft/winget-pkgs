ReleaseNotes: |-
  New embedding models
  - BGE-M3: a large embedding model from BAAI distinguished for its versatility in Multi-Functionality, Multi-Linguality, and Multi-Granularity.
  - BGE-Large: a large embedding model trained in english.
  - Paraphrase-Multilingual: A multilingual embedding model trained on parallel data for 50+ languages.
  New embedding endpoint with batch support
  Ollama now supports a new API endpoint /api/embed for embedding generation:
  curl http://localhost:11434/api/embed -d '{
    "model": "all-minilm",
    "input": ["Why is the sky blue?", "Why is the grass green?"]
  }'
  This API endpoint supports new features:
  - Batches: generate embeddings for several documents in one request
  - Normalized embeddings: embeddings are now normalized, improving similarity results
  - Truncation: a new truncate parameter that will error if set to false
  - Metrics: responses include load_duration, total_duration and prompt_eval_count metrics
  See the API documentation for more details and examples.
  What's Changed
  - Fixed initial slow download speeds on Windows
  - NUMA support will now be autodetected by Ollama to improve performance
  - Fixed issue where the /api/embed would sometimes return embedding results out of order
