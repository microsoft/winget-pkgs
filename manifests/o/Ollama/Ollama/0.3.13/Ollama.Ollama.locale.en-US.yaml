ReleaseNotes: |-
  New safety models
  - Llama Guard 3: a series of models by Meta, fine-tuned for content safety classification of LLM inputs and responses.
  - ShieldGemma: ShieldGemma is set of instruction tuned models from Google DeepMind for evaluating the safety of text prompt input and text output responses against a set of defined safety policies.
  What's Changed
  - Default model in quickstart is now llama3.2
  - Fixed issue where ollama pull would leave connections when encountering an error
  - ollama rm will now stop a model if it is running prior to deleting it
  New Go runner (for contributors):
  Ollama is transitioning to a new Go-based subprocess model runner with improved reliability and caching. This new runner found under the llama directory replaces the previous code under llm/ext_server. During this transition period, the new Go runner is opt-in at build time, and requires using a different approach to build. For more information see development.md.
