ReleaseNotes: |-
  Updates to Ollama for macOS and Windows
  A new version of Ollama's macOS and Windows applications are now available. New improvements to the apps will be introduced over the coming releases:
  - Download for macOS
  - Download for Windows
  New features
  Expose Ollama on the network
  Ollama can now be exposed on the network, allowing others to access Ollama on other devices or even over the internet. This is useful for having Ollama running on a powerful Mac, PC or Linux computer while making it accessible to less powerful devices.
  Model directory
  The directory in which models are stored can now be modified! This allows models to be stored on external hard disks or alternative directories than the default.
  Smaller footprint and faster starting on macOS
  The macOS app is now a native application and starts much faster while requiring a much smaller installation.
  Additional changes in 0.9.5
  - Fixed issue where the ollama CLI would not be installed by Ollama on macOS on startup
  - Fixed issue where files in ollama-darwin.tgz were not notarized
