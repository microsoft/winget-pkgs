ShortDescription: Prototyping tool for React/Typescript Applications.
Description: |-
  ReacType is a rapid prototyping tool for developers employing React component architecture alongside the comprehensive type-checking of TypeScript. In other words, you can draw prototypes and export React / TypeScript code!
  
  ReacType allows users to visualize their application architecture dynamically, employing a drag-and-drop canvas display , a real-time demo render , a real-time component code preview. 
  Users can create components and drag instances of these components, as well as HTML elements, onto the canvas. 
  This architecture can then be exported as TypeScript application files to be used as a starter template for any repository.
