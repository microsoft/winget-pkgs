  Features
  • Plugins synchronization can be sandboxed to avoid app crashes (#27). A selector is available in the Options tab to choose between two implementations OwlPlug JNI (legacy) and the new OwlPlug Scanner. For now, the legacy implementation is used by default, but based on community feedback, it may be replaced by the new scanner in future releases. More information about this feature is available on this wiki page.
  • OwlPlug can be installed using winget on windows : winget install owlplug
  • Google Analytics features have been removed from the app.
