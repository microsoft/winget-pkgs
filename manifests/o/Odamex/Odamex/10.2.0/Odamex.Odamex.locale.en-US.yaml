ShortDescription: Multiplayer-oriented source port for Doom
ReleaseNotes: |-
  Added
  - A new r_softinvulneffect setting, enabled by default, which changes the invulnerability effect to the visible weapon as opposed to the entire screen.
  - The vanilla invulnerability effect has always been a bit of an eyesore, but now that we have spawn invulnerability it has turned migrane-inducing.
  - The current look is not necessarily set in stone, and we plan on making further tweaks to it in the future.
  - A new g_preroundreset setting which will reset the level between the pre-round countdown and the actual game.
  - You can now change the length of time messages appear in the obituary feed with  hud_feedtime.  This setting is also surfaced in the menu.
  - Item counts now show up in the automap.
  - A new cl_centerbobonfire setting which emulates the ZDoom 2.x behavior of centering the weapon when firing.
  - Introduce co_removesoullimit for eliminating the 20 count lost soul limit offline.  Online, this adjusts the cap to 128.  Thanks, Mia!
  - Horde now respects sv_nomonsters.
  - Boss monster projectiles now have the same palette shifts as the bosses themselves.  The projectile behavior itself is still identical...for now.
  - hordenextwave now respawns players.  Thanks, Mia!
  - "AUTOMAP" graphic now appears in the automap options menu.
  - Support for the new Steam WAD file locations.
  Changes
  - Horde bosses now lose their "sparkles" on death.
  - All non-RGB sliders in options menu now display current value to the right.
  - con_notifytime and con_midtime now accept non-integer message timeout times.
  - Certain variations of the scoreboard surrounding round and lives logic had less-than-useful configurations, these have been improved.
  Fixed
  - A significant "pump fake" misprediction of monster behavior was fixed.
  - Multiplayer vanilla demos did not play back at all, now they should work, though there are some remaining assorted issues.
  - Ultimate Doom E2M7 didn't always get detected correctly in the previous map behavior fix, now it should.
  - Online, certain trigger-once line specials were not properly cleared by the client, or improperly able to be triggered again by a newly connecting client.  Now these issues have been fixed.
  - Scrolling floors were being mispredicted in client/server by a factor of two, now they scroll properly.
  - Secrets areas were not getting cleared properly when triggered by other players - now they clear properly.
  - Online, scrollers were being inited twice when restarting the map, this has been fixed.
  - Horde bosses now trigger special lines again.
  - Horde spawns were capable of being pushed around by scrolling floors, now they stay in place.
  - Online, glowing sectors were incorrectly reinitializing when restarting the map, this has also been fixed.
  - Sector flags did not properly save to a savegame, now they do.
  - Single-activation specials were not being cleared on the client, resulting in a desync.  This has been fixed.
  - Horde monsters no longer get crunched by doors.
  - A_HealCorpse did not give resurrected monsters height, now they do.
  - judgment.wad now loads correctly.
  - WDLStats now properly count the last frag in deathmatch modes.
  - Fixed instances of doubled sounds when using A_PlaySound.
