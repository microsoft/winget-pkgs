ReleaseNotes: |-
  🔧 Odamex 12.1.0 is out now!
  This is a minor release with fixes for a few issues found in 12.0.0.
  Added
  - The CVar sv_startwadscript has been added. Similar to sv_startmapscript and sv_endmapscript, the contents of this CVar are executed by the server as a command when changing wads through the maplist or wad command. The script is executed before sv_startmapscript but after compatibility settings have been set by a COMPLVL lump.
  Changed
  - Performance of the server has been improved on Windows 11 by disabling background process throttling.
    - This change raises the minimum required Windows version for Odasrv to Windows 8 or Windows Server 2012
  - Things in sectors with transferred light properties are now lit according to the base sector's original lighting, rather than averaging the transferred floor and ceiling light levels, unless mbf is specified in the COMPLVL lump. See here for more details.
  Fixed
  - Client stability has been improved, with multiple crashes fixed:
    - Frequent crashes when rendering railgun particles
    - A crash when printing serverchat on some platforms
    - A skybox-related crash that occurred in many situations, including playing netdemos or changing resolutions.
  - r_clipmaskedspecial is now properly set in multiplayer, fixing bleeding middle textures in some MBF21 wads
  - Skyboxes now work in both singleplayer and multiplayer
  - The indicator for unknown thing types is visible once again
  - CVE-2019-17544 has been addressed
