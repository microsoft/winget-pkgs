ReleaseNotes: |-
  üöÄ Odamex 11.1 is here!
  While technically a minor release, this update brings some major improvements ‚Äî and we couldn‚Äôt have done it without our amazing contributors.
  üé∂ One of the standout additions is OPL3 Synth emulation, courtesy of PR contributor @jpernst. This long-requested feature (over a decade in the making!) now brings classic-sounding MIDI music right into Odamex ‚Äî and it feels right at home. This is now the default midi synth for Linux platforms.
  üõ†Ô∏è Additional thanks go to:
  - @ceski-1 for fixing long-standing SNDINFO issues
  - @chewi for improving our build system with support for system FLTK 1.4
  - @cmbernard333 for contributing Dockerfile and docker-compose support for odasrv
  - @Acts19quiz and all our dedicated community members for relentless playtesting, bug-hunting, and feedback
  üôå We‚Äôd also like to give a warm official welcome to @electricbrass, who joins the Odamex team! Their contributions have already been enormous, and we‚Äôre incredibly lucky to have them on board.
  üåü And of course, continued thanks to @bcahue for his ongoing work and leadership across the project.
  üîÆ Looking ahead:
  Our next release is expected to be Odamex 12.0.0, which will include full DSDHACKED support and compatibility with most ID24 features. That means you can look forward to running WADs like Eviternity 2, Legacy of Rust, and new versions of Odamex Horde in the very near future!
  Special recognition goes to @cmbernard333 for the monumental effort over the past year in implementing DSDHACKED support.
  If you spot any of these contributors in the Odamex Discord, be sure to thank them ‚Äî their hard work continues to push Odamex forward!
