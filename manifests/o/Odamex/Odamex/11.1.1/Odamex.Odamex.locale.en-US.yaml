  Added
  - Modding Additions

  - New Automap Features
    - Added thick automap line option
    - Add option to highlight locked doors on the automap when not using custom colors
  Fixed
  - Modding and Mapping Fixes
    - Several fixes to UMAPINFO episode handling
  - General Client and Server Fixes
    - Fixed ZDoom line of sight checks, which sometimes allowed enemies to be alerted through walls
    - Corrected incorrect text string when clients would switch to spectator
    - Corrected netdemos failing to record when saving to the default location
    - Remove killfeed toasts that haven't happened yet when rewinding a netdemo
    - Corrected CTF blue flag appearing as an imp in certain netdemos
    - Fixed wrong map numbers being used for IDCLEV
    - Clean up some issues with gotomap on startup
    - Draw scoreboard over crosshair instead of vice versa
  - Vanilla Doom Compatibility
    - Archvile thrust behavior once again matches vanilla Doom
    - Fix Revenant melee attack distance to match vanilla Doom
    - Correct low damage from raising floor crushers
  - Unlagged Fixes
    - Made changes to unlagged which resolves the bug of players taking damage on spawn when they respawn immediately after death, caused by players generally holding +use to respawn immediately, and with no spawn delay, resulting in players respawning on the same tic as death.
  Build/Compiler Additions/Changes/Fixes
  - Added a notification that will print in the Odamex Discord when OdaTests (vanilla demos) results change
  - Allow building against external zstd library without requiring libdwarf
