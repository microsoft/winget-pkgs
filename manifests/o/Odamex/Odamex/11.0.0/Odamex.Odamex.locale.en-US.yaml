ReleaseNotes: |-
  The next major version of Odamex is here! This is a major release with an incredible amount of bug fixes, new features, and quality-of-life improvements. A big thanks to PR contributors @jiffygist (sv_allowfov cvar), @jpernst (console font scaling!), @keyboardcrash32 (fixing Odalaunch crash caused by sorting), @Rudicito (game window initialization bug fix), @FozzeY (fixed coop player starts out of order, special doors desyncing on map restarts, and endianness check on *BSD platforms), and @Acts19quiz (update wad download links).
  It needs to be said that @electricbrass and @bcahue carried a majority of the load in this release. They are incredible. Looking forward, they have been helping lead the way toward Odamex 12, along with @cmbernard333 who has taken the reigns on implementing full DSDHACKED support. Look for that in the near future. Please take a chance to thank everyone involved in this incredible release!
