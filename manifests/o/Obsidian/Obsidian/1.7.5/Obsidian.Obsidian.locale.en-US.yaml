ReleaseNotes: |-
  No longer broken
  - Updated the behavior of the "Add internal link" command so the cursor is placed at the end of the link text, and the link suggestion pop-up appears.
  - Fixed issues where Sync Sidebar timestamps would not reflect changes made locally.
  - Improved render performance of Canvas when there are many nodes on the screen.
  - Fixed issues where the attachment folder would be displayed incorrectly in settings.
  - Fixed regression where the "Add tag" command was not causing the tag suggestions to appear.
  - Fixed bug where Sandbox vault would fail to load if the "Start here" file was missing.
  - File Explorer: "Reveal in file navigation" now waits for the view to load.
  - Fixed bug where tree components (such as the Outline view) would be slow to refresh on Android.
  - Fixed bug where switching between Obsidian and other apps would cause the navigation bar and the toolbar to both be active.
  - Fixed "Installing theme" notice not disappearing when installing a legacy theme.
  - Fixed middle-click not closing tabs.
  - Fixed bug where Graph view options would sometimes get overridden when opening a new graph view.
  Developers
  - The installer has been updated to use Electron v32 (requires downloading the latest installer).
  - Fixed vim langmap failing to load properly.
  - Added a new debug mode for developers. To enable, run app.debugMode(true); in developer tools. When active, inline source maps will not be stripped from loaded plugins.
  - Fixed MarkdownCodeBlockProcessor adding an extra newline when in reading mode.
