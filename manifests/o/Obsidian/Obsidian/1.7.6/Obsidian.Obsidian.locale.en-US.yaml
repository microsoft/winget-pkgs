ReleaseNotes: |-
  No longer broken
  - Fixed Canvas performance issue where media files were remounted during panning.
  - Fixed issue with property editor where property names would overlap with the property values.
  - Clicking on a link in page preview will no longer switch the preview to edit mode.
  - Fixed regression where Obsidian URI left the target window minimized.
  - Fixed issue with parser using too much memory to parse larger Markdown files. This could cause Obsidian to crash when opening very large Markdown files.
  - Fixed File Explorer not highlighting the active file on initial load.
