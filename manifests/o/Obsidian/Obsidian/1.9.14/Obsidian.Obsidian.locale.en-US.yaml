  No longer broken
  - Improved performance when opening quick switcher and command palette when using the latest Obsidian 1.9 installer (Electron v35+).
  - Fixed Global Search reporting inaccurate result count.
  - Bases: Word count is now hidden in the status bar when a base file is focused.
  - Bases: Fixed lag when resizing table columns.
  - Bases: file.hasTag('#tag') is no longer case-sensitive. file.hasTag('test') and file.hasTag('TEST') now return the same results.
  - Bases: The contains function now correctly handles nested tags. For example,tags.contains("A") will now return results containing #A as well as #A/B.
  - Bases: Formulas using this now work if a Base file is embedded inside Canvas.
  - Bases: Formulas using this now resolve to null if the Base is not in the sidebar and not embedded.
  - Desktop: Fixed an issue where pop-out windows would not reopen after quitting the app.
  Developers
  The installer has been updated to use Electron v37.6.0 (requires downloading the latest installer). For users on macOS Tahoe, this may improve app performance.
