ReleaseNotes: |-
  Improved
  - Secret Storage is now encrypted at rest.
  - Daily notes: Folder path is now normalized.
  - Daily notes: If you were previously using the "Open daily note on startup" option, you will be automatically migrated to use the new "Files & Links › Default file to open" setting.
  No longer broken
  - Fixed Default file to open not working when the configured file path omits the file extension.
  - Fixed daily notes not opening if the path began with a leading / or used \ as a path delimiter.
  - Restored default display text when inserting a link with folders in the linktext (e.g. [[a/b/file]] will automatically be inserted as [[a/b/file|file]]).
  Developers
  - The CSS variables --blur-translucency-s and --blur-translucency-m have been renamed to --blur-opacity-s and --blur-opacity-m.
