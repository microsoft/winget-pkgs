ReleaseNotes: |-
  Improvements
  - Recently used commands now appear at the top of the command palette.
  - The editor suggestions now scroll back to the top on input changes.
  - Middle-clicking on the tab forward/back navigation buttons now opens the file in a new tab.
  - Added a "Comment" option to the editor context menu under the "Format" submenu.
  - Improved handling of files with invalid frontmatter:
    - Reading mode shows an error message at the top of the file.
    - The "Add property" command now shows an error instead of removing invalid frontmatter.
  No longer broken
  - Fixed line renumbering issue when pasting multi-line list items. Subsequent numbers now update correctly.
  - Pressing Enter in a multi-line list item now continues the list properly.
  - Fixed regression where the "Open in new window" command caused files to fail to open.
  - Fixed "Toggle comment" command sometimes placing the cursor in the wrong position.
  - Fixed hover preview sometimes appearing in the wrong position.
  - Fixed issue where closing a pop-out window at certain times prevented events like saving the workspace from firing.
  - Fixed issue where the "Toggle backlinks in document" command threw an error.
  - Fixed bug where opening a note with folded headings didn’t restore folds correctly if a heading contained a code block.
  - Fixed graph view errors when setting "force" options to 0.
  - Fixed page preview not working reliably in Graph view:
    - Hovering over nodes now reliably opens page previews.
    - Hovering then pressing the modifier key also opens the page preview.
    - Hovering over multiple nodes in quick succession now properly updates the preview.
  - Clicking a link in the sidebar (without pressing a modifier) now focuses the tab as expected.
  - Canvas: Fixed issue where double-clicking a node label switched the node to edit mode.
