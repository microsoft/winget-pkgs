  Details
  - Bugfix - Wrong davUser in cmd client: #10946
    We fixed a bug where the wrong dav user was used in the url, when the username from the credentials differed from the username used on the server.

  - Bugfix - Missing mtime in ocis uploads: #10950
    When uploading a file to ocis the server ignores the X-OC-Mtime header and expects the mtime to be part of the Upload-Metadata header. We now provide both.
