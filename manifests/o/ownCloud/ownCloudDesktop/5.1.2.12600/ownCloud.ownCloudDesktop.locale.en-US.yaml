  - Bugfix - Fix crash when keychain job takes longer than expected: #11361
    In 5.1.1, we introduced a timeout for keychain jobs that killed them when their execution time exceeded 5 seconds and log this to allow debugging of problems related to secrets handling.
    Apparently, there are valid cases in which these jobs can take longer than the expected timeout, e.g., when the user needs to unlock their keychain first or configure it otherwise.
    We now let the jobs run indefinitely and log every 5 seconds whether the job is still running.
