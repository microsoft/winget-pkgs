ReleaseNotes: "Session\nSession uses the Session encryption protocol and the Oxen blockchain’s decentralised Service Node network to provide anonymous, end-to-end encrypted messaging without relying on central servers.Release Overview\n- Disappearing Messages now has two modes, Disappear after Send and Disappear After Read #3016\n- When Disappear after Send is selected, messages will disappear from sender, recipient and network simultaneously a set time after they have been sent, regardless of whether the recipient has received or read the message.\n- When Disappear after Read is selected, messages will disappear for the sender and the sender’s swarm a set time after they have been sent, and for the recipient and the recipient’s swarm a set time after they have been read. Messages which haven’t been read\t after 14 days will disappear for the recipient and their swarm.\n- Both options will be available in 1-1 chats, but only Disappear after Send will be available in Groups. Neither will be available in Communities.\n- This release includes the new version of Disappearing Messages, however the feature won't be enabled until March 13th 10am AEDT, this will give users time to update their clients to be able to interpret the new type of messages\n- Moved the Message Info in the right panel #3021 #3024\nSignatures\n\n\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\nHash: SHA256\n\nThe following hashes have been signed for verification using keejef's GPG keys\nlocated in the oxen core repository at \n\nSHA256 Hashes\n\nlatest-linux.yml c2db51a948fb7db6fc2bac2f5aab1a966a2aec670f780fefd1e3ff05c4d951b5\nlatest-mac.yml 98c2f607ffc8a3a5976d443a7eed1c26c325d37e3ecebba77b1cfaa118c05f47\nlatest.yml a5ffbcffb6d76ee56eef488c0626156e3518091388c0f6b9959b7980703317db\nsession-desktop-linux-amd64-1.12.0.deb 98825369bff16194c63990b3089cd10c75a81d21748207935f4fee67d5ba611c\nsession-desktop-linux-x64-1.12.0.freebsd c9f8b693734bfb2921a08b55cc9c47a48d0b17ee6686c99ef9747ff34979de8c\nsession-desktop-linux-x86_64-1.12.0.AppImage f4e177d69778b2d0492be9e41dab6c8d594dc345a745b6373e61acb77b5fbc90\nsession-desktop-linux-x86_64-1.12.0.rpm 5ee9d97f52d069dd09c4093769e2197c4175ed1c8affb2c3602bd3ae712e21de\nsession-desktop-mac-x64-1.12.0.dmg 180ce32aae9c846e0550e8ecaea25642d8f909c9cb467724633992d7252b41b7\nsession-desktop-mac-x64-1.12.0.dmg.blockmap 8c71054b8ef16175c31de7802a7925410e4594973ee6c0f0837e1c650f7c2864\nsession-desktop-mac-x64-1.12.0.zip 8323f11aea5f87d26097b0332a7deceb0e6d8c87e959d68875f043d3a74e5a65\nsession-desktop-mac-x64-1.12.0.zip.blockmap 6999defb5200fc22488e1ec84aed4ca577c2ddcdc2d9afcf0f21dcb97d85ac72\nsession-desktop-win-x64-1.12.0.exe 46637ed547d11c3d05ebd609cda06a8d635f77ab9ef886ad5d1fcd1aed34b581\nsession-desktop-win-x64-1.12.0.exe.blockmap f7212f5cf3c68683f71721d9a99ccc42805bf6fca470b2aa2dc2912adab309eb\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\niIIEARYIACoWIQT8KCHeNb2DnpPTrnZQ94kLze2QqwUCZd6ptQwca2VlQG94ZW4u\naW8ACgkQUPeJC83tkKtsdAD/UmX/k1JvhugXuGPrkWY78/ymg/iVEAyaPXjuJr4y\nHfgBAKTrRfkbo3pWfaXH+0tzs/vKtuSLWCQllo4IxmUMD0UG\n=0vl2\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\nSupported Platforms\nSession requires Windows 10 or later, macOS Catalina (10.15) or later, or a linux distribution with glibc 2.29 or later like Debian 10 or Ubuntu 20.04."
