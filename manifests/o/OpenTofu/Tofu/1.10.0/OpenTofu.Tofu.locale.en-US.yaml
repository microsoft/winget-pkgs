  OpenTofu 1.10.0
  We're thrilled to announce the release of OpenTofu 1.10.0, our most comprehensive update yet! This release represents months of dedicated work from our community, introducing some fantastic features that will improve how OpenTofu users manage and distribute infrastructure as code.
  Highlights
  This release cycle introduces major new capabilities and integrations:
  OCI Registry Support
  Full integration with OCI registries for both provider and module distribution, valuable for organizations with private infrastructure-as-code components, air-gapped environments, or enhanced security requirements.
  # Configure OCI registry mirrors in your CLI configuration:
  provider_installation {
    oci_mirror {
      repository_template = "example.com/opentofu-providers/${namespace}/${type}"
      include             = ["registry.opentofu.org/*/*"]
    }
  }
  # Use OCI modules directly in your configuration:
  module "vpc" {
    source = "oci://example.com/modules/vpc/aws"
  }
  Native S3 Locking
  Simplify your infrastructure by using S3's conditional writes capability for state locking, eliminating the need for a separate DynamoDB table.
  terraform {
    backend "s3" {
      bucket       = "tofu-state-backend"
      key          = "statefile"
      region       = "us-east-1"
      use_lockfile = true  # Enable native S3 locking
    }
  }
  OpenTelemetry Tracing
  Gain insights into OpenTofu operations with experimental OpenTelemetry tracing, completely local and under your control.
  # Launch a tracing backend like Jaeger
  docker run -d --name jaeger \
    -p 16686:16686 -p 4317:4317 \
    jaegertracing/jaeger:2.5.0
  # Configure OpenTofu to use OpenTelemetry
  export OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER=otlp
  export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4317
  export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_INSECURE=true
  # Run your operations and view traces at http://localhost:16686
  tofu init
  Resource Management with Target Files
  Manage complex deployments more easily with the new -target-file and -exclude-file options, allowing version-controlled resource targeting patterns.
  # Create a targets.txt file
  # Critical infrastructure components
  module.networking.aws_vpc.main
  module.networking.aws_subnet.public[*]
  # Apply only those resources
  tofu apply -target-file=targets.txt
  # Similarly, create an excludes.txt file to skip certain resources
  tofu plan -exclude-file=excludes.txt
  Compatibility Notes

  - macOS: Requires macOS 11 Big Sur or later
  - The ghcr.io/opentofu/opentofu image is no longer supported as a base image
