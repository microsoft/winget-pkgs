ReleaseNotes: |-
  OpenTofu 1.11.0
  We're proud to announce that OpenTofu 1.11.0 is now officially available! 🎉
  Highlights
  This release cycle introduces major new capabilities and integrations:
  Ephemeral Values and Write Only Attributes
  Ephemeral resources allow you to work with confidential data, temporary credentials, and transient infrastructure without persisting them to your state.
  ephemeral "aws_secretsmanager_random_password" "password" {
  }
  resource "kubernetes_secret_v1" "credentials" {
    metadata {
      name = "admin"
      namespace = "my-app"
    }
    data_wo = {
      username = "admin"
      password = ephemeral.aws_secretsmanager_random_password.password.random_password
    }
    data_wo_revision = 1
    type = "kubernetes.io/basic-auth"
  }
  The enabled Meta-Argument
  If you want to conditionally deploy a resource, you no longer have to use count = var.create_my_resource ? 1 : 0, you can now add the new enabled meta-argument to your resource to conditionally deploy it.
  resource "aws_instance" "web" {
    ami           = "ami-12345"
    instance_type = "t3.micro"
    lifecycle {
      enabled = var.create_instance  # Simple boolean condition
    }
  }
  Compatibility Notes
  - macOS: Requires macOS 12 Monterey or later
  - Azure Backend (azurerm):
    - The endpoint and ARM_ENDPOINT configuration options are no longer supported
    - The msi_endpoint and ARM_MSI_ENDPOINT options are no longer supported
    - The environment and metadata_host arguments are now mutually exclusive
  - issensitive() Function: Now correctly returns unknown results when evaluating unknown values. Code that previously relied on the incorrect behavior may need updates.
  - Testing with Mocks: Mock values generated during testing now strictly adhere to provider schemas. Test configurations with invalid mock values will need to be corrected.
  - S3 Module Installation: When installing module packages from Amazon S3 buckets using S3 source addresses OpenTofu will use the same credentials as the AWS CLI and SDK.
  - TLS and SSH Security:
    - SHA-1 signatures are no longer accepted for TLS or SSH connections
    - SSH certificates must comply with the draft-miller-ssh-cert-03 specification
