  1.10.3
  BUG FIXES:
  - OpenTofu will no longer crash in a rare case where a dynamically-invalid expression has its error suppressed by try or can and then that expression becomes relevant for deciding whether to report a "change outside of OpenTofu" in the human-oriented plan diff. (#2988)
  - Ensure provider downloads into temp are cleaned up correctly on windows. (#2843)
  - Correctly handle structural typed attributes during test provider mocking. (#2994)
  - Fix erroneous detection of changes with sensitive resource attributes. (#3024)
