ReleaseNotes: |-
  We're proud to announce that OpenTofu 1.9.0 is now officially out! ðŸŽ‰This release includes a lot of major and minor new features, as well as a ton of community contributions!The highlights are:
  - for_each in provider configuration blocks: An alternate (aka "aliased") provider configuration can now have multiple dynamically-chosen instances using the for_each argument:
  provider "aws" {
    alias    = "by_region"
    for_each = var.aws_regions

    region = each.key
  }

  Each instance of a resource can also potentially select a different instance of the associated provider configuration, making it easier to declare infrastructure that ought to be duplicated for each region.
  - -exclude planning option: similar to -target, this allows operators to tell OpenTofu to work on only a subset of the objects declared in the configuration or tracked in the state.
  tofu plan -exclude=kubernetes_manifest.crds

  While -target specifies the objects to include and skips everything not needed for the selected objects, -exclude instead specifies objects to skip. OpenTofu will exclude the selected objects and everything that depends on them.
  Please take the above for a spin and let us know your feedback!For all the features, see the detailed changelog.You can find the full diff here.
