ReleaseNotes: |-
  Fixes ##
  - Updated SteamVR Libraries to 1.26.7
  - Changed behavior of space drag to ignore play area error In some setups the play area does not seem to be properly reported to steamvr, this does not effect the chaperone, and as such we should ignore it as a UX matter for users.
  - Updated the camera options in SteamVR tab, these may not work but the update to steamvr requires it
  - Updated and fixed some errors in space drag with ResetSeatedZeroPose and ResetZeroPose
