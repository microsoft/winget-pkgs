ReleaseNotes: |-
  Changelog
  - Removed support for older drivers that ship an AMF Runtime older than version 1.4.14.
    You will now need a minimum Driver version of 19.7.1, however the recommended minimum is 19.9.2 which contains a lot of fixes compared to 19.7.1.
    This also includes dropping support for unmodified Windows 8 systems as AMD has stopped providing driver updates to Windows 8.
  - Added the new "High Motion Quality Boost" option which seems to be exclusive to the Navi (RDNA) series of AMD GPUs.
  - Fixed automatic VBV Buffer calculation with values close or above 50%.
  - The Video API option will now only show the most modern supported API on the platform, which is Direct3D 11 on Windows 10 and Direct3D 9 on Windows 7.
    Users on Windows 8 are urged to upgrade to Windows 10.
