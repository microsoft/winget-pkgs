  If you would like to support the OBS Project, please consider contributing to our Patreon or Open Collective!
  [!NOTE]
  NVIDIA users may need to update their GPU drivers to 531.61 (Windows) / 530.41.03 (Linux) or newer.
  [!IMPORTANT]
  The code signing certificate for OBS is being updated. This may impact game capture compatibility with some anti-cheat solutions starting with the next major OBS update. If you are a game or anti-cheat developer please see https://obsproject.com/kb/capture-hook-certificate-update for more information.
  30.2 New Features
  - Added support for Multitrack Video streaming [palana]
      - On Twitch, this is known as Enhanced Broadcasting. For more information, see: https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/multiple-encodes
      - The supported audio channel configurations are stereo or mono.
      - This feature is currently only available on Windows and requires an NVIDIA GTX 900, GTX 10, or RTX 20 series GPU or newer or an AMD RX 6000 series GPU or newer. Support for other operating systems and GPU vendors is planned.
      - When this feature is enabled, the following data about your system will be sent to the streaming service when starting a stream:
          - OBS version and audio/video settings (Resolution, framerate, audio channels/tracks)
          - CPU info (Name, speed, core counts)
          - GPU info (Model, memory, driver version, device ID, vendor ID)
          - Memory info (Free, total)
          - OS info (name, version, arch, emulation)
              - Windows info (Gaming feature status: Game Bar, Game DVR, Game Mode, Hardware-accelerated GPU Scheduling)
          - Multitrack Video settings (Maximum streaming bandwidth, maximum video tracks)
  - Added support for Enhanced RTMP/FLV multi-track audio and video [palana/kc5nra]
      - Replaces the old metadata-based "VOD Track"
  - Added "Hybrid MP4" output format (BETA) [derrod]
      - Combines fault-tolerance of fragmented MP4 with wide compatibility and faster access times of regular MP4. For more information, see: https://obsproject.com/kb/hybrid-mp4
      - Supports inserting chapter markers into the file via a hotkey or API. These markers are supported by most video players and editing software, such as DaVinci Resolve
  - Added Linux support to the native NVENC encoder [derrod]
      - NVENC AV1 is now supported on Linux
  - Added Linux shared texture support to the NVENC encoder [derrod]
  - Added Linux shared texture support to the QuickSync encoder [kkartaltepe]
  - Added Linux shared texture support to the VA-API encoder [nowrep]
  - Added HEVC support to WebRTC output [murillo128]
  - Added Composable Themes system to simplify theme creation, maintenance, and enable future customization options [derrod/Warchamp7]
      - Themes now consist of a base theme and variants that can be switched between in the new "Appearance" settings tab
      - Old themes will no longer work and will need to be updated to the new system. See the wiki page for details: 
      - The legacy System theme is no longer available. If it was used for accessibility reasons with high contrast, enable high contrast in your operating system settings to re-enable the OBS System Theme. OBS can only detect high contrast on Windows and macOS at this time.
  30.2 Changes
  - Various UI and Theme tweaks [Warchamp7]
  - Audio of multiple instances of a source in a scene/group is now deduplicated [derrod]
      - Deduplication is recursive, but does not apply on groups or nested scenes that are currently playing show/hide transitions, this may be fixed in the future
  - Scene Collection specific plugin data is now retained for plugins that are not currently loaded [derrod]
  - Closed-captions are now supported for HEVC and AV1 [jhnbwrs]
  - Qt Fusion style is now always enforced on Linux [tytan652]
  - Combined PipeWire window/display capture into unified "Screen Capture" source to align with other platforms [tytan652]
      - Renamed "Screen Capture (XSHM)" as "Display Capture (XSHM)" for consistency with other capture sources [tytan652]
  - Set default recording format on macOS to fragmented MOV [gxalpha]
  - Improved freetype2 text source performance [kkartaltepe]
  - File open dialogs now start in the directory of the currently selected file, rather than the default [Warchamp7]
  - Moved warnings in advanced output to bottom of settings window for better visibility [GPattenden]
  - Various performance improvements for texture encoding [kkartaltepe]
  - Prioritize NVDEC decoder on NVIDIA systems [moocowsheep]
