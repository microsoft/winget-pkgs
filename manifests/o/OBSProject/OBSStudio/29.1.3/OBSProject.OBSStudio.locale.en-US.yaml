  - Added support for multiple audio tracks in Simple output recording [pkv]
  - Added a DLL blocking feature for Windows.
    This allows OBS to block problematic DLLs from attaching to OBS and causing freezing or crashes, for example 3rd party overlay hooks and outdated video capture devices. [notr1ch]
  - This blocks old versions of popular VTubing software virtual cameras that are known to cause freezes when accessing video capture device properties.
    If you are affected, please update to the latest version of your VTubing software.
