ReleaseNotes: >
  27.2.1 Hotfix Changes
 
  • Fixed an issue that triggered a full system freeze for some users. Made a legendary workaround to some sort of driver/kernel bug which was triggered by the browser source (I am really proud of this) [Jim]
  
  • Improved performance of the updated Chromium build of browser source (I am also really proud of this) [Jim]

  • Fixed an issue where some users with certain older Windows versions would not be able to stream at a very high bitrate [R1CH]

  • Fixed an issue where some cameras wouldn’t decode correctly on Linux [kkartaltepe]

  • Fixed an issue where common in-program shortcuts stopped working sometimes (such as Ctrl-F to make a source fit to screen) [gxalpha/WizardCM]

  • Fixed a bug on Windows 8.1 where desktop audio capture stopped working [WizardCM]

  • Fixed SRT and RIST from crashing OBS when a URL isn’t set or when disabling a Media source with a RIST URL [pkv]

  • Fixed a memory leak in PipeWire capture on Linux [fzwoch]

  • Fixed an issue where the resize grip would break if you dragged it all the way to the top in the filters window [WizardCM]

  • Updated AOM/SVT encoders again because there seems to be some new good changes [Jim]

  • Hiding OBS from capture is now logged [WizardCM]

  • Fixed an issue on macOS where FFmpeg dependency filenames were unnecessarily complex, breaking some third party plugins [PatTheMav]

  • Added the ability to set different blend modes to sources via the source right-click context menu (similar to Photoshop’s layer blending for example) [jw0z96]

  • Added hotkey filter search [furious]

  • Added hotkey duplicate detection [furious/Jim]
