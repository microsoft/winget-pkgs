  - Added Hybrid MOV support [derrod]
    - Brings ProRes support on macOS and a more widely supported HEVC/H.264 + PCM audio option to all platforms
  32.0 Changes
  - OBS Studio will no longer load plugins built for a newer release of OBS to prevent future compatibility issues [norihiro]
  - Added custom OBS widgets in preparation for larger UI updates [derrod/gxalpha/Warchamp7]
