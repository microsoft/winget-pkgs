  - 5416a16b  2023-04-20 Jonathan Thomas          Adding back in "layers", "markers" to webview changes - since we accidentally filtered them out.
    HEAD, origin/release-20230417
  - 1ee5f7b3  2023-04-19 Jonathan Thomas          Allow "duration" to be sent to the webview, to allow auto-increase project duration / auto resize the timeline
  - 0979288d  2023-04-18 Jonathan Thomas          Protect setWindowTitle from being called by a different thread (preview_thread - if sample_rate is updated).
    Protect preview_thread::update() method from triggering with 'sample_rate' update.
  - 91b19e54  2023-04-17 Jonathan Thomas          Protecting timeline webview from unrelated changes - which can sometimes happen prior to the webview being fully loaded (causing a freeze on launch of OpenShot)
  - 967a429b  2023-04-17 Jonathan Thomas          On launch of OpenShot, convert float sample_rate into Integer (if needed), and update settings::sample_rate if needed.
    This causes our audio device to freeze

    Reported in Sentry: OPENSHOT-1WJ5
  - 8d896e84  2023-04-16 Jonathan Thomas          Show friendly error to user when Export dialog fails to parse project JSON data: Reported in Sentry: OPENSHOT-6X

  - e0af3c5f  2023-04-16 Jonathan Thomas          Refactor some logic in Parent / Child property context menus - to be simpler, and more efficient.
    This solves a bug on Windows also, where file paths were not matching correctly.
  - 954d8685  2023-04-16 Jonathan Thomas          Adding debug logs to property widget context menus
  - 92cf3d40  2023-04-13 Jonathan Thomas          Removing items from "Parent" and "Child Clip ID" and "Parent Effect" context menus in the Property dialog - for example, clips with no effects, or clips with no tracking data, etc...
    Also, making things more consistent with parent folders in context menus (None, Clips, Tracked Objects)
  - 3b260d73  2023-04-13 Jonathan Thomas          Fix object detector and tracker effects when using context menus, color pickers, and other property dialog editors - to correctly update the JSON without destroying certain data or "objects"

  - 36d9b361  2023-04-13 Jonathan Thomas          Updating timeline changed callback to always reset the current value of ENABLE_PLAYBACK_CACHING.

    This method was accidentally re-enabling the caching when we were not expecting it to.
