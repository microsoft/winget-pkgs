ShortDescription: Command-line Git information tool
Description: |-
  Onefetch is a command-line Git information tool written in Rust that displays project information and code statistics for a local Git repository directly to your terminal.
  The tool is completely offline - no network access is required.
  By default, the repo's information is displayed alongside the dominant language's logo, but you can further configure onefetch to instead use an image - on supported terminals -, a text input or nothing at all.
  It automatically detects open source licenses from texts and provides the user with valuable information like code distribution, pending changes, number of dependencies (by package manager), top contributors (by number of commits), size on disk, creation date, LOC (lines of code), etc.
  Onefetch can be configured via command-line flags to display exactly what you want, the way you want it to: you can customize ASCII/Text formatting, disable info lines, ignore files & directories, output in multiple formats (Json, Yaml), etc.
  As of now, onefetch supports more than 50 different programming languages.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Onefetch is now typically more than twice as fast when executing. This was made possible by reducing allocations and switching from git2-rs to gitoxide. A big thank you to @Byron for his contribution.
  - A web interface onefetch.dev was developed by @spenserblack allowing users to visualize an ASCII preview for all the programming languages currently supported by onefetch. Like the binary, the data is parsed from the Languages.yaml file.
