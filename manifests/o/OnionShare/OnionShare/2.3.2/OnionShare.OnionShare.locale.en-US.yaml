ShortDescription: OnionShare is an open source tool that lets you securely and anonymously share files, host websites, and chat with friends using the Tor network
Description: |-
  OnionShare lets you securely and anonymously share files of any size.
  It works by starting a web server, making it accessible as a Tor onion service, and generating an unguessable URL to access and download the files.
  It doesn't require setting up a server on the internet somewhere or using a third party file-sharing service.
  You host the file on your own computer and use a Tor onion service to make it temporarily accessible over the internet.
  The other user just needs to use Tor Browser to download the file from you.
