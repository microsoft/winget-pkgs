ShortDescription: OnionShare is an open source tool that lets you securely and anonymously share files, host websites, and chat with friends using the Tor network
Description: |-
  OnionShare lets you securely and anonymously share files of any size.
  It works by starting a web server, making it accessible as a Tor onion service, and generating an unguessable URL to access and download the files.
  It doesn't require setting up a server on the internet somewhere or using a third party file-sharing service.
  You host the file on your own computer and use a Tor onion service to make it temporarily accessible over the internet.
  The other user just needs to use Tor Browser to download the file from you.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Major feature: a new 'Quickstart' screen, which enables toggling on or off an animated automatic connection to Tor.
    This allows configuring network settings prior to automatic connection.
  - Major feature: Censorship circumvention.
    Use new features in the upstream Tor API to try to automatically obtain bridges depending on the user's location.
  - New feature: automatically fetch the built-in bridges from the upstream Tor API rather than hardcode them in each release of OnionShare.
  - New feature: keyboard shortcuts to access various modes and menus, and accessibility hints
  - Bug fix: Temporary Directory for serving the OnionShare web pages was broken on Windows
  - Packaging: Packaging is more automated, and Linux Snapcraft releases are available for amd64, arm64, and armhf
  - Miscellaneous: Many dependency updates and web page theming improvements
