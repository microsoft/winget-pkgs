ReleaseNotes: |-
  Discord  Open Collective backers and sponsors GitHub SponsorsFull Changelog: New features
  - Native macOS AppleSilicon (M1 / M2 / M3) release :-)
  - Experimental, Linux-only: support for directly controlling GPIOs, PWMs, ADCs, DACs. Mainly useful on embedded boards such as Raspberry Pi.- Tested on Pi 4, Pi Zero, Orange Pi 5 Plus. You may need to add your user to the relevant groups or run as root.

  gpio- Experimental, Linux-only: support for reading GPS data from a gpsd server. Needs a custom build with libgpsd, not built-in with the official releases yet.
  - Very experimental and buggy, feedback welcome: support for streaming output through FFMPEG directly, for instance to record (finally!) the output of the score to a file, both audio and video, or stream it over internet.
  libav- Ports now indicate when an address is set, with a diagonal strike.
  - Linux builds now come with more QPA back-ends built-in such as VNC. Also minimal QPA for ensuring a minimal memory footprint, for instance when using Score on a Pi Zero.
  - New process to spam an input to an OSC address pattern smoothly. A chef's favorite!
  x
  - VST3 support on Raspberry Pi
  - CMake: add a flag to enable ignoring any library that may have been found through homebrew.
  - ArtNet: use custom fixture names if given
  Updates & improvements
  - Updated built-in pd and libpd version to 0.54
  - MIDI timing improvements. In particular, when using JACK under Linux with the JACK MIDI backend, live MIDI input will now be sample-accurate. Timing should also be tighter in general.
  Bugfixes
  - Bugfixes in curve edition
  - Many shader fixes for better support of Metal, D3D etc.
  - UI optimizations for usage on low-power computers, Raspberry Pi etc.
  - Fixes for running under RPi with Bookworm.
  - Bugfix on the JS rendering pipeline.
  - Video: allow live-changing the video file.
  - Fix some font issues that had cropped up with the Qt 6 migration.
  - mac: many Syphon bugfixes.
  - Fixes to JIT plug-in for newer LLVM versions (thanks @dave2309 !)
  - Fix that VST detection was broken since update to Qt 6.5 changing the QtWebsocket API
  - Various ArtNet / DMX fixes
  - Fix issues with DMX USB PRO dmx backend
  - UI fix: ports had stopped growing under the cursor since Qt 6 update.
  - Fix for some shaders that didn't work because they weren't being transformed correctly by the ISF backend.
