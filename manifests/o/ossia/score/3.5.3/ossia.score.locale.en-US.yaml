  ossia score 3.5.3 is another series of small bugfixes and improvements after the large 3.5.0 release.
  Full Changelog: v3.5.2...v3.5.3
  New features and changes
  - Audio: Support using the PIPEWIRE_QUANTUM in addition to PIPEWIRE_LATENCY to set buffer size and sample rate under pipewire.
  - Linux: add a small independent binary that will run to devise whether the app has all the necessary dynamic libraries available.
  - OSC: allow to resolve by using DNS and not just IP addresses; refactor the DNS resolving code across the codebase. (#1689)
  - Windows: implement camera resolution enumeration using the most atrocious Win32 API.
  - Image node: add a stretch mode port.
  - AI models: add EmotionNet support for detecting emotions, DepthAnythingV2 for converting RGB frames into depth frames, and YOLO-segmentation support.
  - AI models: better default engine selection.
  - Gestures: add many new gesture detection algorithms courtesy of Yash Tiwary, our GSoC student. Thanks @pyandcpp-coder!
  Bugfixes
  - UI: Fix an UI bug when reloading an item with an XY slider.
  - Core: enforce using the same hash function in most places.
  - UI: improve rendering performance of cables.
  - Presets: fix loading presets of objects that may change ports.
  - Core: large cleanup of codebase compiler warnings which had accumulated.
  - Packaging: improve support for packaged KFR (#1819).
  - Core: update to boost 1.88.
  - Mapper: fix a concurrency bug which could have caused crashes when restoring a score which created and removed mapper devices.

  - Windows / Mac: fix the Window devices being jittery when moved (#1783).

  - Graphics: fix some textures still being inverted on Metal and D3D11/D3D12.
  - macOS: fix to enable running under Xcode frame capture.
  - Graphics: allow offscreen renderers to use something else than OpenGL now that it works fine.
  - MIDI: replace MIDI Pitch with MIDI Filter which is more powerful.
  - Graphics: handle more cases of texture formats in different processes, e.g. support R8 or RGB as input instead of only RGBA in Avendish nodes.
  - VST3: fix for some buggy plug-ins which do not follow the spec and do not allow deleting and recreating their IPlugView.
  - macOS: fixes for GL rendering (#1807).
  - UI: improvements to focus behaviour (#1811).
  - Camera: fix #1814.
  - UI: improvement to Graphics Combo ui widget.
