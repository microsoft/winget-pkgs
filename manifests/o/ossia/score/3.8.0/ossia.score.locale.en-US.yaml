  ossia score is a sequencer for audio-visual artists, designed to create interactive shows.
  Sequence OSC, MIDI, DMX, sound, video and more, between multiple software and hardware. Create interactive and intermedia scores, script and live-code with JavaScript, ISF Shaders, Faust, PureData or C++. Leverage IoT protocols such as CoAP or MQTT, interact with joysticks, Wiimotes, Leapmotions, Web APIs and BLE sensors and integrate programs from a wealth of creative programming languages such as Structure Synth, Context-Free Art and Bytebeat. Load any kind of audio or video format and process visuals through Spout, Syphon, NDI, Shmdata or Sh4lt ; sonify large datasets with CSV and HDF5 support.
  ossia score 3.8.0 is a major release introducing a lot of new features, UX improvements and back-end improvements.
  Full Changelog: v3.7.1...v3.8.0
  New features
  - arpeggiator: add more controls, add a random mode
  - array tool: add a way to insert and erase values in the input array at a regular stride
  - ci: add a manual workflow to enable triggering builds with custom CMake options
  - code editor: add built-insearch with Ctrl+F
  - console: implement completion, persistent history and readline-like shortcuts
  - core: add utility functions to detect MDM enrollment
  - core: allow loading addons that have runtime dependencies in Documents/ossia/score/support/
  - core: change process priority on startup on win32
  - cuda: add utility function to check whether it is available
  - custom ui: add support for QtWebView if available (needs a source build, we won't ship QtWebEngine as it requires a MSVC Qt build)
  - custom ui: allow to override appname/domain/etc with env vars to simplify custom apps
  - custom ui: greatly improve the capabilities for creating custom apps on top of ossia score: support QRC files, icons, etc. Add helper scripts and templates to allow people to create their own custom ossia score-based apps.
  - custom ui: improve fonts and color palette
  - device recorder: allow to set separator in generated CSV file
  - devices: add support for QML protocols which require OAuth authentication with Ossia.OAuth (currently requires building from source with QtNetworkAuth support).
  - devices: enable adding some devices during execution (Camera, Window, etc.).
  - devices: implement a new Default Device kind for cameras, MIDI devices and gamepads, that will select the default device on the user's system. Useful for examples, etc.
  - exprtk: add useful math functions: bitwise_and, bitwise_or, bitwise_xor, bitwise_not, bitwise_shiftl, bitwise_shiftr, map, norm, step, lerp, smoothstep, smoothstep5
  - ffmpeg: handle gpu decoding of 16-bit float single-channel textures
  - geometry: Add a raw Raster Pipeline object which allows to render using entirely custom shader, with only a small veneer of isf. e.g. this allows to define what are the vertex inputs / outputs with much greater control than classic ISF shaders. This also allow instanced rendering.
  - geometry: Rework geometry in depth, allow geometry and buffer passing in every avnd objects, add support for instancing.
  - geometry: allow to have both CPU and GPU buffer handles, automatically convert in-between depending on the needs of objects.
  - gfx: add support for Spout in the D3D11, D3D12 and Vulkan backends.
  - gfx: add support for Syphon in the Metal backend.
  - gfx: allow buffer ports to pass buffers around. White ports can now carry either buffers or textures.
  - gfx: compute shader: render single-component textures as white instead of red.
  - gfx: implement support of SSBOs as output of Compute Shader process
  - icons: add icons for console_on/console_off in icons_16. Thanks @aklevy!
  - images: add support for more image formats, including SVG.
  - js: Add new API for storing and retrieving state of JS objects across restarts and communicating between UI and execution.
  - js: Fully implement custom UI support.
  - js: Make sure that engines respect import paths, and change presets to use a qmldir to import JS files, so that we do not hit QTBUG-107204
  - js: Whenever possible, load QML files from disk to trigger the disk cache, which will enable much faster loading / reloading on the execution thread
  - js: add Device.toValue function, to convert JS values to a simpler representation
  - js: add Util.uuid()
  - js: add a System object to retrieve general system info
  - js: add support for Qt Quick 3D to create 3D UIs easily as well as give access to PBR materials, environment maps, etc.
  - js: add support for downloading packages from the Library.* api
  - js: allow to have both an execution script and a UI script.
  - js: give access to transport object, to connect to play(), stop(), etc.
  - js: gpu: allow using texture inlets
  - js: major rework: Have a single engine per-thread with distinct QQmlContext instead of one engine per object
  - js: more utility functions
  - js: new APIs (Library, System, etc)
  - js: new api functions: Score.device("foo"); Score.device("Window").window(); Score.save() / Score.load() / Score.saveAs(); Score.documentPlugin(), mainly useful to enable saving custom data from JS into a score.
  - layouts: add new layouts displaying all ports vertically when an object is in folded mode.
  - led view: add ability to set an explicit size
  - library: Add a new Timing category for all the timing-related objects (metronome, MIDI Sync, LTC, etc.)
  - lightness computer: add support for custom swizzle to handle uncommon LED formats.
  - mapper: allow to create dummy nodes just to store and retrieve data
  - midi: add MIDI sync objects to generate and track MIDI Clock and Timecode.
  - midi: add support for interpreting and / or sending Note ON with a value of 0 instead of note off. Needed for instance for some Novation Launchpad devices.
  - midi: handle reloading a midi device across backends / OS through various heuristics
  - new process: Add many geometry utilities: Geometry Info to get basic info about an input geometry, Extract attribute / buffer / etc., Create a mesh from multiple buffers, Pointcloud to mesh, Repack attributes to pack or multiple attributes of a geometry into a single buffer.
  - new process: Array to Buffer and Buffer to Array, to go easily e.g. from an OSC message to a GPU buffer.
  - new process: LTC input.
  - new process: Tempo synchronizer. This process will analyze incoming position and speed variations, obtained for instance from timecode, and turn them into real-time speed adjustments to keep smooth playback.
  - new process: add a ArrayToTexture object
  - new process: add a multi-choice object
  - new process: add a node text box to leave comments around

  - package manager: allow to download packages without main ui
  - ports: ports without a UI control will now display a label.
  - processes: allow processes to have both a script editor and a custom UI by separating the concept of script-editable process.
  - processes: allow to match multiple address groups in objects that can send / receive from/to multiple addresses
  - qml/gfx: handle QSG_RHI_BACKEND. If set, it will override the chosen graphics backend.
  - scenario: add zoom with scroll wheel, fix zoom +/- centering
  - script editor: style update. Default font is now IBM Plex which is much more readable on Win32
  - scrub: implement scrubbing on scenario
  - sound: implement backwards audio playback ; Also add a limit on how low we can downsample as it seems that libsamplerate does not like very small tempos
  - time ruler: double click becomes play from here

  - ui: allow to set visual outputs as background
  - ui: basic scrub with play tool
  - ui: refactor more deeply script processes to allow processes to have separate scripting and UI.
  - ui: support text OSC messages with line breaks and tabs
