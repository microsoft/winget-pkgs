  ossia score is a sequencer for audio-visual artists, designed to create interactive shows.
  Sequence OSC, MIDI, DMX, sound, video and more, between multiple software and hardware. Create interactive and intermedia scores, script and live-code with JavaScript, ISF Shaders, Faust, PureData or C++. Leverage IoT protocols such as CoAP or MQTT, interact with joysticks, Wiimotes, Leapmotions, Web APIs and BLE sensors and integrate programs from a wealth of creative programming languages such as Structure Synth, Context-Free Art and Bytebeat. Load any kind of audio or video format and process visuals through Spout, Syphon, NDI, Shmdata or Sh4lt ; sonify large datasets with CSV and HDF5 support.
  ossia score 3.6.0 is a major release introducing useful new features and objects.
  Full Changelog: v3.5.3...v3.6.0
  New features and changes
  - AI: new model support: FastVLM for video-to-text real-time inference.
  - AI: new model support: GAN image generation e.g. with MobileStyleGAN, FBAnimeGAN. More to come!
  - AI: new model support: GAN image processing e.g. with AnimeGANv3, DeblurGAN, FSRGan. More to come!
  - AI: new model support: LLM inference with Qwen3.
  - Audio: add initial support for CLAP plug-ins on Mac, Windows and Linux. Testing and feedback needed!
  - Audio: new reverber inspired from vintage Alesis MIDIVerb (BarrVerb, ported from [github.com/ErroneousBosh/BarrVerb](https://github.com/ErroneousBosh/BarrVerb)).
  - Avnd: improvements to the available APIs for UI to enable more use-cases with cross-controls interactions.
  - Bytebeat: implement a safe mode to try and avoid SIGFPE errors when a division by zero happens due to wrong bytebeat code.
  - Core: add xtensor, xsimd and xtl and eigen as official built-in libraries accessible to score addons.
  - Core: AI prompt composer.
  - Core: AI prompt tweener.
  - Core: the codebase now officially requires C++23 to build.
  - EGLFS / vkkhrdisplay: allow to exit the app with esc when running without X11 or Wayland for unattended installations.
  - Gfx: add support for Shadertoy effects, by drag'n'drop of Shadertoy URLs into a score which will trigger an automated conversion to ISF.
  - JIT: port to jitlink which fixes a lot of limitations when JIT-compiling plug-ins.
  - Linux: add a --platform argument to the appimage, to replicate the functionality of the previous Raspberry Pi scripts (ossia-score-eglfs, etc).
  - LV2: fixes for finding plug-ins in /usr/ with the AppImage.
  - Patterns: add support for patterns from drumpatterns.onether.com.
  - Processes: new data processing tool: Classifier (based on RapidLib, similar to Wekinator).
  - Processes: new data processing tool: Regressor (based on RapidLib, similar to Wekinator).
  - Processes: new object: interpolator. From a set of weights and a set of values, provides the linear interpolation of each values. Useful for navigating latent spaces!
  - Processes: new object: Nodes, to allow interpolation across multiple states. Features both a "circular node" mode, as well as a Voronoi mode.
  - Processes: new objects in the Puara toolkit: Correlation, Compass, Binarize, ERP, Clustering, PCA, Power Band. Thanks @pyandcpp-coder!
  - Processes: new objects: Impulse, String, Float, Integer to force the casting of a value type.
  - Processes: new objects: Knob, Multislider to have simple UI affordances to control parameters.
  - QML UI: add a TextureSource object to allow custom UI to import a texture from the output of a process.
  - QML UI: Qt Quick and Qt Quick Controls are now available to use for external UIs with official releases, which allows to make custom software with advanced UIs backed by a given score.
  - Script console, mapper device: add objects to allow low-level access to TCP and UDP sockets (#1798) as well as OSC.
  - Script editor: syntax highlighting for Faust code.
  - SDK: update the platform to LLVM 20, Qt 6.10.
  - UI: allow to copy the value of a Value Display easily.
  Bugfixes and improvements
  - #1720: CMake issues with concurrentqueue on FreeBSD.
  - #1831: Missing includes.
  - #1833: Sporadic macOS crash when inferring AI models.
  - Avnd: processes with file ports will now relativize paths correctly to allow easier project portability across computers.
  - Avnd: put message bus things in a thread for GUI objects.
  - CI: a few hundred fixes as always.
  - Core: use std::span everywhere consistently.
  - Faust: fix live-coding a synth (#1829).
  - Fix missing port count in process library.
  - LV2: fixes to Suil and LV2 integration.
  - Reworked categories.
  - SDK: many bugfixes to features to allow building addons against the score SDK.
  - SDK: rework the CI infrastructure to allow repos building score addons to use a shared set of Github actions on [github.com/ossia/actions](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/ossia/actions).
  - UI: improve multi-xy pad rendering.
  - UI: improve reliability of script editor GUI.
