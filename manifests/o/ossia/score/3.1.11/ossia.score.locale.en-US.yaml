ShortDescription: ossia score, an interactive sequencer for the intermedia arts.
ReleaseNotes: |-
  New features
  - A new execution mode for scenarios, where only one interval can execute at the same time, useful for making easier the creation of scores with alternating sounds, videos, etc.
  - New control type to be used in plug-ins: range spinbox.
  - Big CI overhaul and update with newer platforms, e.g.
    Debian Bookworm, Ubuntu Lunar.
    Build with MSVC reinstated.
  - Building with Pipewire is now also tested on CI.
  - PureData integration: add the extra patches to the search path if they are found on the user's system.
  - Add a SCORE_AUDIO_BACKEND environment variable to allow forcing the audio backend and not load any other at all, mainly to save a bit on startup time.
  Changes
  - Linux: use PipeWire instead of ALSA / PortAudio by default for new installations.
  Bugfixes
  - Fix Smoother not updating internal data when type of smoothing applied changes, e.g. the controls would not reflect the reality when switching from 1â‚¬ to Median filter.
  - Video: remove bogus 2* factor in video renderer.
    Fix #1470.
  - Fix developer build on Fedora.
  - LV2: Do not fail at startup if score was built with LV2 support but libsuil is not found.
