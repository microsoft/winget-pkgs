  [v1.1.1] - 2025-05-06
  This update has been brought to you by the contributions of:
  Fayez Akhtar (@Variable-ind)
  Built using Godot 4.4.1
  Added
  - Implemented isometric & hexagonal tile shapes for tilemap layers! #1213
  - Implemented a hexagonal grid type, with support for both pointy-top and flat-top orientations.
  - It is now possible to flatten all selected layers into one layer.
  - Hexagonal pointy-top and flat-top presets have been added in the tile mode offsets dialog.
  - Added a single bezier mode in curve tool, that works similarly to Aseprite's curve tool. #1216
  - OpenRaster (.ora) and Aseprite (.ase/.aseprite) files are now being displayed as options in the "Open" dialog.
  - Added shortcuts for going to the previous/next frame of the same tag. By default, they are mapped to Control + < and Control + > respectively.
  - Holding the "automatically change layer" shortcut (Control + Alt by default) now displays a rectangle around the selected cel, or around the cel whose non-transparent pixels are being hovered by the cursor.
  - Users can now color code their cels in the timeline.
  - A button for reporting extensions has been added to the extension explorer. #1214
  Changed
  - Resizing the canvas, cropping to content and centering frames now moves the offset of each tilemap layer instead of affecting its tileset. #1213
  - Scaling the project also scales the size of the tiles by the same amount that the project was scaled. For example, scaling a 64x64 project to 128x64 would scale 16x16 tiles to 32x16. #1213
  - Switched "tags by column" and "tags by rows" in the export dialog, when exporting spritesheets.
  - The minimum window size has been decreased to (300, 200). #1221
  - The pencil/eraser/shading brush flip/rotation UI is now consistent with the tiles panel flip/rotation UI, and it also supports the same shortcuts.
  - The shortcut groups in the Preferences have been re-organized. The Buttons group has been removed, instead the shortcuts are grouped according to their respective panels, such as Timeline, Global Tool Options and Palettes.
  - Cels with a non-zero z-index display a "z" in the timeline.
  - The reference image rotation incerement step was changed to 0.01. #1210
  - When opening the new tag dialog, the name field automatically grabs focus.
  Fixed
  - Value sliders and rulers are no longer displaying integers as floats.
  - Fixed a crash when using the lasso and polygon select tools outside of the canvas.
  - Using the bucket tool on draw tiles mode on an empty tilemap no longer crashes the app. #1213
  - Fixed a crash when switching between tilemap layers with different tilesets, while having selected tiles the positions of which do not exist on the new tilemap's tileset. #1213
  - Duplicating tilesets in the project properties no longer crashes the app when a previously deleted tileset is still selected. #1213
  - Fixed the import tag option not pasting the frame content, and not working for tilemap and audio layers.
  - Z-indexed cels are now being rendered with their proper order in the canvas. #1220
  - The "change layer automatically" shortcut (Control + Alt by default) no longer works when a selection tool is active, thus preventing the shortcut conflict with the "transform copy selected content" shortcut.
  - Prevent switching project tabs and saving, if a native save file dialog is already open. This prevents rare cases of saving two open projects with the same name, thus leading to data loss.
  - The native save file dialog now always has a default name for the saved .pxo file.
  - Fixed horizontal scrolling on the timeline on macOS. #1219
  - Fixed selection resizing not working from the tool options. #1212
  - The tile indices that appear when holding Control and a tilemap layer is selected, now scale based on the grid cell size. #1213
  - Applying layer effects to passthrough group layer immediately updates the canvas.
  - The "select pixels" from the cel menu now works properly with undo.
  - Fixed a "section not found" error in the Preferences when launching Pixelorama for the first time. #1211
  - Fixed the pencil density slider value not updating when switching between tools.
  - Fixed the color picker acting weirdly when the alpha of the color is set to 0.
  - Rulers now update whenever the canvas panel resizes.
  - Fixed a regression in v1.1 where mouse button shortcuts (such as the mouse thumb buttons) were not activating tools.
  - Empty audio layers now only show the audio icon in the frame where the audio is supposed to start playing.
  - Fixed issue where the wrong font would be chosen for the interface in certain circumstances. #1217
  - Fixed canvas preview's camera not being fit to frame when Pixelorama first launches and the canvas preview is visible.
  Removed
  - The "All" grid type option has been removed, as it is no longer needed since we can now display multiple grids at once.
