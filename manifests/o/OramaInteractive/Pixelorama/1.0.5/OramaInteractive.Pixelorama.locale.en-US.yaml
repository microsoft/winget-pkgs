ReleaseNotes: |-
  [v1.0.5] - 2024-11-18
  This update has been brought to you by the contributions of:
  Fayez Akhtar (@Variable-ind)
  Built using Godot 4.3
  Added
  - Add density to the square & circle brushes. 100% density means that the brush gets completely drawn. Anything less leaves gaps inside the brush, acting like a spray tool.
  - Selection expanding, shrinking and borders have been added as options in the Select menu.
  - Mouse buttons can now be used as menu shortcuts. #1070
  - Added confirm and cancel buttons in the selection tool options to confirm/cancel an active transformation.
  - OKHSL Lightness sorting in palettes has been implemented. #1126
  Changed
  - The brush size no longer changes by Control + Mouse Wheel when resizing the timeline cels or the palette swatches.
  - Improved the UI of the Tile Mode Offsets dialog and added an "Isometric" preset button.
  - The Recorder panel now automatically records for the current project. This also allows for multiple projects to be recorded at the same time.
  Fixed
  - Opening the Tile Mode Offsets dialog no longer crashes the application.
  - Panels no longer get scrolled when using the mouse wheel over a slider.
  - Fixed layer effect slider values being rounded to the nearest integer.
  - Fixed memory leak where the project remained referenced by a drawing tool, even when its tab was closed.
  - Fixed memory leak where the first project remained forever references in memory by the Recorder panel.
  - Slightly optimize circle brushes by only calling the ellipse algorithms once while drawing
  Removed
  - The Recorder panel has been removed from the Web version. It wasn't functional anyway in a way that was useful, and it's unsure if we can find a way to make it work.
