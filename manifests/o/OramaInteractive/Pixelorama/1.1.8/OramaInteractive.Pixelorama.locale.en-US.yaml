ReleaseNotes: |-
  [v1.1.8] - 2025-12-31
  This update has been brought to you by the contributions of:
  Fayez Akhtar (@Variable-ind), @Bartkk0
  Built using Godot 4.5.1
  Added
  - Added support for multi frame/cel swapping! #1393
  - You can now search & rename tilesets in the project properties dialog. #1383
  - Various improvements to the import image dialog have been made when importing an image as a spritesheet, such as a preset system and the ability to include or exclude empty tiles. #1385
  - The recorder panel now has more options, such as the ability to use FFMPEG to export the recording as a gif file, and the ability to set a custom rectangular area of the screen to record. #1387
  Changed
  - Gif files are now being exported frame by frame, which saves memory space and users can now see the current progress of the export. #1396
  - The override.cfg file, which is used to store settings such as single-window mode, window transparency and audio driver is now stored in the same place as the config.ini file, instead of the same folder as the Pixelorama executable.
  - When double clicking on a layer button to rename it, the entire text is now automatically selected. #1411
  Fixed
  - The "apply all" toggle when importing multiple images is now faster. #1390
  - Fixed a visual bug with clipping masks. #1389
  - Clear the saved processed images from memory when closing the export dialog, so that they don't waste space in memory. #1397
  - Fixed selection animated borders setting not being applied on startup.
  - Non-valid names for projects are no longer allowed in the project properties. #1383
  - Fixed guides being appended twice when loading Krita & Photoshop projects, leading to crashes when hovering over the canvas rulers.
