  [v1.1.5] - 2025-09-06
  This update has been brought to you by the contributions of:
  Fayez Akhtar (@Variable-ind)
  Built using Godot 4.4.1
  Added
  - Project palettes have been implemented, with undo/redo support! #1335
  - Implemented loading Krita (.kra) files with animation support. Only projects using RGBA with 8-bit color depth are supported at the moment.
  - Loading animations from Photoshop (.psd) files is now possible.
  - Loading palettes from Aseprite (.ase/.aseprite) files is now possible.
  - Implemented loading Piskel (.piskel) files with animation support.
  - Added a zoom parameter to the offset shader. #1330
  - The currently selected frame & layer are now remembered inside .pxo files.
  - Added an option to transform content in Modify selection. #1309
  - Relative paths are now supported in the CLI. #1326
  Changed
  - Bumped extensions API version to 7.
  - When clicking on the remove layer button, now all selected layers get removed. This is consistent with how frames get deleted, and is what users would expect.
  - During animation playback on frames of a tag, if the user changes to a frame of a different tag, then the frames of that tag are being played. #1311
  - Using the move tool on a tilemap layer while draw tiles mode is active now clears the selection, if there is any. #1340
  - Current frame & layer are used as default values when importing an image as a new frame, new layer or to replace a cel.
  Fixed
  - The bucket tool's flood fill has been further optimized. #1306
  - Creating rectangular selections now snap to the grid correctly, if snapping is enabled. #1338
  - Pasted selections now get snapped to grid. #1340
  - Pasting a selection on a tilemap layer while draw tiles mode is active now updates the tileset. #1340
  - Backups no longer appear in the recent project list. #1341
  - The names of the projects are no longer being translated in tabs. #1334
  - Fixed the drop shadow dialog not having a selected option by default for the affect option button.
