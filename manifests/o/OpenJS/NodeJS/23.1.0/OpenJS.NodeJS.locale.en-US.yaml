ReleaseNotes: |-
  Notable Changes
  Buffer now work with resizable ArrayBuffer
    When a Buffer is created using a resizable ArrayBuffer, the Buffer length will now correctly change as the underlying ArrayBuffer size is changed.
    Contributed by James M Snell in #55377.

  MockTimers test runner API is now stable
    MockTimers, introduced in April 2023, has just reached stable status. This API provides comprehensive support for mocking Date and all major timers in Node.js, including setTimeout, setInterval, and setImmediate, both from the node:timers, node:timers/promises modules and global objects. After months of refinement, developers can now fully rely on MockTimers for testing time-based operations with confidence, ensuring better control over asynchronous behavior in their Node.js applications.
    Contributed by Erick Wendel in #55398.

  JSON modules and import attributes are now stable
    The two proposals reached stage 4 of the TC39 process, at the October 2024 meeting. The Node.js implementation already matches exactly the semantics required by the proposals.
    Contributed by Nicolò Ribaudo by #55333.
