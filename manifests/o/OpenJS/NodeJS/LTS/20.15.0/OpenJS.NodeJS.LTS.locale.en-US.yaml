ReleaseNotes: |-
  test_runner: support test plans
  It is now possible to count the number of assertions and subtests that are expected to run within a test. If the number of assertions and subtests that run does not match the expected count, the test will fail.

  inspector: introduce the --inspect-wait flag
  This release introduces the --inspect-wait flag, which allows debugger to wait for attachement. This flag is useful when you want to debug the code from the beginning. Unlike --inspect-brk, which breaks on the first line, this flag waits for debugger to be connected and then runs the code as soon as a session is established.

  zlib: expose zlib.crc32()
  This release exposes the crc32() function from zlib to user-land.

  It computes a 32-bit Cyclic Redundancy Check checksum of data. If value is specified, it is used as the starting value of the checksum, otherwise, 0 is used as the starting value.

  The CRC algorithm is designed to compute checksums and to detect error in data transmission. It's not suitable for cryptographic authentication.

  cli: allow running wasm in limited vmem with --disable-wasm-trap-handler
  By default, Node.js enables trap-handler-based WebAssembly bound checks. As a result, V8 does not need to insert inline bound checks int the code compiled from WebAssembly which may speedup WebAssembly execution significantly, but this optimization requires allocating a big virtual memory cage (currently 10GB). If the Node.js process does not have access to a large enough virtual memory address space due to system configurations or hardware limitations, users won't be able to run any WebAssembly that involves allocation in this virtual memory cage and will see an out-of-memory error.

  --disable-wasm-trap-handler disables this optimization so that users can at least run WebAssembly (with a less optimial performance when the virtual memory address space available to their Node.js process is lower than what the V8 WebAssembly memory cage needs.
