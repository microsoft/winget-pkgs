ReleaseNotes: |-
  Notable Changes
  This release marks the transition of Node.js 22.x into Long Term Support (LTS) with the codename 'Jod'. The 22.x release line now moves into "Active LTS" and will remain so until October 2025. After that time, it will move into "Maintenance" until end of life in April 2027.
  Other than updating metadata, such as the process.release object, to reflect that the release is LTS, no further changes from Node.js 22.10.0 are included.

  OpenSSL 3.x
  Official binaries for Node.js 22.x currently include OpenSSL 3.0.x (more specifically, the quictls OpenSSL fork). OpenSSL 3.0.x is the currently designated long term support version that is scheduled to be supported until 7th September 2026, which is within the expected lifetime of Node.js 22.x. We are expecting upstream OpenSSL to announce a successor long term support version prior to that date and since OpenSSL now follows a semantic versioning-like versioning scheme we expect to be able to update to the next long term supported version of OpenSSL during the lifetime of Node.js 22.x.
