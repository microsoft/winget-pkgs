  Notable Changes
  Vulnerabilities fixed:
  - CVE-2021-22918: libuv upgrade - Out of bounds read (Medium)
    - Node.js is vulnerable to out-of-bounds read in libuv's uv__idna_toascii() function which is used to convert strings to ASCII. This is called by Node's dns module's lookup() function and can lead to information disclosures or crashes. You can read more about it in https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-22918
  - CVE-2021-22921: Windows installer - Node Installer Local Privilege Escalation (Medium)
    - Node.js is vulnerable to local privilege escalation attacks under certain conditions on Windows platforms. More specifically, improper configuration of permissions in the installation directory allows an attacker to perform two different escalation attacks: PATH and DLL hijacking.
