ReleaseNotes: |-
  Notable Changes
  This release marks the transition of Node.js 20.x into Long Term Support (LTS) with the codename 'Iron'. The 20.x release line now moves into "Active LTS" and will remain so until October 2024. After that time, it will move into "Maintenance" until end of life in April 2026.
  Known issue
  Collecting code coverage via the NODE_V8_COVERAGE environment variable may lead to a hang. This is not thought to be a regression in Node.js 20 (some reports are on Node.js 18). For more information, including some potential workarounds, see issue #49344.
