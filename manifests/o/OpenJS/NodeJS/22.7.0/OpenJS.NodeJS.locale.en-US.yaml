ReleaseNotes: |-
  Experimental transform types support
    With the new flag --experimental-transform-types it is possible to enable the transformation of TypeScript-only syntax into JavaScript code.
    This feature allows Node.js to support TypeScript syntax such as Enum and namespace.
    Thanks to Marco Ippolito for making this work on #54283.

  Module syntax detection is now enabled by default.
    Module syntax detection (the --experimental-detect-module flag) is now enabled by default. Use --no-experimental-detect-module to disable it if needed.
    Syntax detection attempts to run ambiguous files as CommonJS, and if the module fails to parse as CommonJS due to ES module syntax, Node.js tries again and runs the file as an ES module.
    Ambiguous files are those with a .js or no extension, where the nearest parent package.json has no "type" field (either "type": "module" or "type": "commonjs").
    Syntax detection should have no performance impact on CommonJS modules, but it incurs a slight performance penalty for ES modules; add "type": "module" to the nearest parent package.json file to eliminate the performance cost.
    A use case unlocked by this feature is the ability to use ES module syntax in extensionless scripts with no nearby package.json.
    Thanks to Geoffrey Booth for making this work on #53619.

  Performance Improvements to Buffer
    Performance of Node.js Buffers have been optimized through multiple PR's with significant improvements to the Buffer.copy and Buffer.write methods. These are used throughout the codebase and should give a nice boost across the board.
    Thanks to Robert Nagy for making this work on #54311, #54324, and #54087.
