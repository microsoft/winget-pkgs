ReleaseNotes: |-
  Notable Changes
  Fixed distribution for native addon builds
  This release fixes an issue introduced in Node.js v17.0.0, where some V8 headers
  were missing from the distributed tarball, making it impossible to build native
  addons. These headers are now included. #40526
  Fixed stream issues
  - Fixed a regression in stream.promises.pipeline, which was introduced in version
    16.10.0, is fixed. It is now possible again to pass an array of streams to the
    function. #40193
  - Fixed a bug in stream.Duplex.from, which didn't work properly when an async
    generator function was passed to it. #40499
