ReleaseNotes: |-
  New API to retrieve execution Stack Trace
    A new API getCallSite has been introduced to the util module. This API allows users to retrieve the stacktrace of the current execution.
    Thanks to Rafael Gonzaga for making this work on #54380.

  Disable V8 Maglev
    We have seen several crashes/unexpected JS behaviors with maglev on v22 (which ships V8 v12.4). The bugs lie in the codegen so it would be difficult for users to work around them or even figure out where the bugs are coming from. Some bugs are fixed in the upstream while some others probably remain.
    As v22 will get stuck with V8 v12.4 as LTS, it will be increasingly difficult to backport patches for them even if the bugs are fixed. So disable it by default on v22 to reduce the churn and troubles for users.
    Thanks to Joyee Cheung for making this work on #54384

  Exposes X509_V_FLAG_PARTIAL_CHAIN to tls.createSecureContext
    This releases introduces a new option to the API tls.createSecureContext. For now on users can use tls.createSecureContext({ allowPartialTrustChain: true }) to treat intermediate (non-self-signed) certificates in the trust CA certificate list as trusted.
    Thanks to Anna Henningsen for making this work on #54790
