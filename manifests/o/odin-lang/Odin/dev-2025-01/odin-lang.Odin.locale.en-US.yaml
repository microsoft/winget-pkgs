ReleaseNotes: |-
  New Language Features
    - `#+feature dynamic-literals`
      - All dynamic literals (maps and dynamic arrays) are disallowed by default to remove implicit allocations from Odin
      - If the user wants to allow this, it can be enabled on a per-file basis by adding the above "build tag"
      - Dynamic literals like the following:
        - `[dynamic]int{1, 4, 9, 16}`
        - `map[string]int{"Apple" = 759, "Pear" = 128, "Gorilla" = 533}`

  Compiler Improvements
    - `ensure`/`ensure_contextless`
      - Identical to `assert`/`assert_contextless` but is not removed with `-disable-assert`
    - Remove viral `#force_inline` and `#force_no_inline`
      - Declaring a procedure with these tags would previously virally apply them to procedures called inside the subject procedure too, it now just affects the procedure it is applied to
    - Fix bug with comparisons with big endian types
    - Improve zeroing rules for `resize_dynamic_array`
    - Add implicit broadcasting for `#simd` arrays
    - `map_entry` ([Docs](https://pkg.odin-lang.org/base/builtin/#map_entry))
