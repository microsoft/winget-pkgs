      - Removes the need for the start procedure initializing the RTTI table
      - Previous approach was due to limitations and bugs in LLVM
    - Promote types in `#c_varargs` according to C rules
    - Reduce dynamic library dependencies on macOS
      - We were previously linking with LLVM-C, LLVM, and libunwind, however only LLVM was needed since it contains LLVM-C, and libunwind comes with macOS already
