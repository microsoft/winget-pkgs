ReleaseNotes: |-
  Bug fixes / Code cleanup
  ------------------------
  - SIGSEGV crash: Do not check key_state buffers that are in S_UNDEF state
    (Github #449) - the new sanity check function introduced in 2.6.7
    sometimes tried to use a NULL pointer after an unsuccessful TLS handshake

  - Windows: --dns option did not work when tap-windows6 driver was used,
    because internal flag for "apply DNS option to DHCP server" wasn't set
    (Github #447)

  - Windows: fix status/log file permissions, caused by regression after
    changing to CMake build system (Github: #454, Trac: #1430)

  - Windows: fix --chdir failures, also caused by error in CMake build system
    (Github #448)

  - doc: fix typos in documentation

  User visible changes
  --------------------
  - Windows: print warning if pushed options require DHCP (e.g. DOMAIN-SEARCH)
    and driver in use does not use DHCP (wintun, dco).
