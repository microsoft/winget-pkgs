ShortDescription: Service Studio is the OutSystems low-code and visual development environment
Description: 'Service Studio is the environment for creating all parts of the application stack: the data model, application logic, UI, business process flows, integrations, and security policies. In this environment, designers drag and drop visual elements to create UIs, business processes, business logic, and data models for their applications. Applications also consume and expose SOAP and REST web services in this environment. AI-assisted development guides developers through the process, suggesting next steps, auto-filling fields, and offering developers the ability to search for answers  to their "how-to" questions and other information right in the IDE.'
