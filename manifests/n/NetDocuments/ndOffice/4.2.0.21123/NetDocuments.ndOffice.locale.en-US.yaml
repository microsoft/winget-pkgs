  New Features

  50 GB Upload Support
  ndOffice now accepts document uploads up to 50GB in size. This is supported in all areas of ndOffice, including ndSave, Document Import, and Drag and Drop to Activity Center.
  The repository setting Allow large files (bigger than 2 GB) is respected, so if the setting is disabled (unchecked), users cannot upload files larger than 2GB via ndOffice. If the setting Allow large files (bigger than 2 GB) is disabled, users will see the message ‘File exceeds file size limit in the selected destination’ when attempting to upload files above 2 GB.

  Improved Upload Performance
  Overall upload performance in ndOffice has been improved to allow for enhanced upload time, especially with large files.

  Fixed Issues
  - Fixed an issue where the following error would appear at random when users switched between emails: ‘An error occurred during communication with MS Outlook. Sorry for the inconvenience. Please try again later.’
  - Fixed an issue in which the Cancel Upload button remained active after successfully cancelling a session with 100,000 items in a folder.
  - Fixed an issue where an internal error would occur when retrying and cancelling large imports.
  - Fixed an issue where uploading a folder using the document import tool would trigger an error if the folder contained a zero-byte file.
  - Fixed an issue where setting the ndOffice language to anything other than English caused the document history entries in the NetDocuments website to appear as Unknown entry.
  - Fixed an issue in which document imports would fail when using the document import tool due to errors in workspace key validation.

  NOTE: After any ndOffice update has been completed, ndOffice will need to be started manually from the start menu and the user will need to log in again. Thereafter, ndOffice will start automatically with the user logged in until the next update or until they log out.
