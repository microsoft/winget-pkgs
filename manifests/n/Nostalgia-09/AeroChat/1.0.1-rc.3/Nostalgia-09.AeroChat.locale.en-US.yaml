ShortDescription: A Discord client themed to look like WLM 09, in React and Typescript.
ReleaseNotes: |-
  As per vote in the Nostalgia '09 Discord server, this update adds a dynamic banner system (the things on the 
  bottom of the homepage). This means that now, I can accept monthly donations in order to pay for things like 
  the website, and in return, donators can have their banners in the project for the duration of a month. If you're
  interested in donating, in return for a banner image which navigates to a URL on click:

  Join the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/nP9SxVQGnu)
  Tag me (@/notnullptr) and say that you want to donate!
  I'll DM you with some info and stuff and how to donate.
  
  Payment methods accepted:
  - Cashapp
  - Gift cards of most varieties (preferably Amazon but beggars can't be choosers)
  - Any sort of Discord Nitro subscription
  
  These will be toggle-able in a future update, but I'd like to push this change first.
