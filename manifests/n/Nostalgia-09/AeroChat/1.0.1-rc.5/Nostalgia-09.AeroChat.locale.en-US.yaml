ShortDescription: A Discord client themed to look like WLM 09, in React and Typescript.
ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Added scenes.
    This includes:
  - Color theming (in future, will allow you to upload images to use as a Nitro user)
  - Banner syncing (even as a non-Nitro user, other AeroChat users can see your built-in scene whenever they DM you)
  - More accurate home screen (paper fold added)
  - Fixed a bug where channels without categories wouldn't appear in the channels list.
  - Partially fixed emoticons; some emojis people send, and all picked from the emoji picker will show as old Windows Live Messenger emoticons (hopefully).
