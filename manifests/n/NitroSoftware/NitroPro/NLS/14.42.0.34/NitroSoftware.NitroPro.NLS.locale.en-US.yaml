ReleaseNotes: |-
  Fixed Issues & Improvements
  Improved PDF/A Compliance & Expanded Archival Format Support
  - Nitro PDF Pro 14.42 delivers a major upgrade to its PDF/A engine. The core conformance library has been updated to ensure more reliable, standards-aligned PDF/A output after conversion, and Nitro now supports the full family of PDF/A-3 variants:
    - PDF/A-3a
    - PDF/A-3b
    - PDF/A-3u
  - The expanded PDF/A-3 support significantly increases Nitro's compatibility with modern archival, accessibility, and document-exchange standards and empowers users to create archival-grade PDFs with embedded data, accessibility, and enhanced search-ability.
  Stability & Reliability
  - Crash prevention improvements:
    - Added robust memory checks to prevent rare crashes when rendering large or complex images.
    - Fixed a crash that occurred when editing documents with corrupt page trees — the app now handles such files gracefully without crashing.
  - Improved error handling:
    - Fixed scenarios where documents could become locked and undeletable after failed PDF/A conversions.
    - Resolved two issues that previously prevented successful FDF data imports for documents with template pages or nested form fields.
  - Display & character handling:
    - Fixed corruption issues when editing documents containing Macron characters (used in Māori and similar languages).
    - Annotations with Chinese or other non-Latin text now display and can be edited correctly in Adobe Acrobat.
  Compatibility & Feature Enhancements
  - Annotation standardization:
    - Corrected a minor spec typo in text annotation intent (FreeTextTypeWriter), improving compatibility with third-party viewers like MuPDF. Backward compatibility with older annotations is maintained.
  - Signature handling:
    - Improved consistency by displaying signer names only from the certificate, ensuring accuracy even when annotations contain inconsistent data.
  - Redaction enhancements:
    - Refined overlay text behavior:
      - Fixed font sizing logic for "Auto" mode to ensure text fully fits within the redaction area.
      - Disabled "Repeat text" when auto-sizing is enabled.
  Security & Compliance
  - Updated core components: Upgraded the FreeType library to v2.14.1, addressing known vulnerabilities.
  - Enhanced registry protection: Closed a potential loophole where URLs could be injected via registry keys.
  - Safer timestamp handling: Fixed parsing issues for timestamps from Entrust timestamp servers, ensuring signature verification consistency.
  Cloud & Integration Improvements
  - iManage integration:
    - Added options to follow redirections in all iManage calls.
    - Introduced new feature flag imanage.redirect_to_default_if_wrong_server for flexible connection handling.
    - Fixed an issue that caused auto-tagging to fail when opening documents from iManage remote storage.
  - SharePoint integration:
    - Streamlined auto-tagging workflow to reduce redundant confirmation prompts during document opening.
  UX & Productivity Enhancements
  - Batch processing: The "Ask before overwriting an existing file" option is now enabled by default, helping users avoid accidental data loss.
  - UI consistency:
    - Disabled drag-and-drop reordering in the signature tree to prevent confusion.
    - Exposed the former skip_image_merge registry option in the Printer Preferences UI, improving accessibility for power users.
  Internal & Engineering Improvements
  - Fixed internal build job failures and removed redundant dependencies to simplify maintenance.
  - Added new automated test coverage to strengthen regression protection for future updates.
