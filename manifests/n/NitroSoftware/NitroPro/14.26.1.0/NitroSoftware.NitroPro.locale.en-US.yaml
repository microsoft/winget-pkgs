    What's New
    - Introducing Hang Detection on Nitro PDF Pro for Windows. This feature detects when the application hangs (stops responding) and prompts users to send error reports to Nitro.
      Alongside the existing Crash Detection, the new Hang Detection tool is enabled by default for all users. However, it may be disabled by administrators. See our User Guide and Deployment Guide for more details.
    Fixed Issues & Improvements:
    - Resolved an issue where large images (10mb+) used for watermarks could crash the application.
    - Improved performance on document text searching with the Search and Redact tool.
    - Resolved an issue to save trusted URLs to be opened without permission validation.
