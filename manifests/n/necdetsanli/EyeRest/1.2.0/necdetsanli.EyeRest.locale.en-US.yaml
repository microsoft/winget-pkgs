  ## Highlights

  EyeRest 1.2.0 introduces a more flexible reminder workflow, an optional
  left-click toggle, and a small About dialog – while keeping the app lightweight
  and telemetry-free.

  ### ✨ What’s new

  - Configurable reminder interval (per session)
    - You can now adjust the reminder interval in minutes (e.g. 5, 20, 45…) instead
      of being locked to 20 minutes.
    - The default interval is still 20 minutes in Release builds (with a shorter
      interval in Debug for testing).
  - Optional left-click toggle
    - A new option lets you use left-click on the tray icon to toggle reminders on
      or off.
    - When enabled, a single left-click:
      - Flips the reminder state,
      - Updates the tray icon (normal vs. snoozed),
      - Shows a short confirmation notification.
    - When disabled, a single left-click simply opens the Options dialog for better
      discoverability.
  - About dialog
    - A new About window shows:
      - App name and version (from assembly metadata),
      - Author information,
      - A short privacy note (no telemetry, no personal data collection),
      - A direct link to the GitHub repository.
  - Toast notifications with balloon fallback
    - EyeRest now prefers Windows 10/11 toast notifications (via
      Microsoft.Toolkit.Uwp.Notifications) for reminders and state changes.
    - If toasts are not supported or fail at runtime, it falls back to classic tray
      balloon tips so you still get notified.

  ### ⚙️ Improvements & fixes

  - The tray icon now consistently uses:
    - The main EyeRest icon when reminders are enabled,
    - A dedicated snoozed icon when reminders are disabled,
      including after state changes and when using toasts with balloon fallback.
  - The reminder timer now uses a session-only ReminderIntervalMinutes value
    instead of a hard-coded 20-minute interval.
  - The Options dialog wording has been updated (e.g. “Enable reminders”) for
    clearer behavior.
  - A few internal cleanups around timer shutdown and UI marshaling improve
    reliability on exit.
