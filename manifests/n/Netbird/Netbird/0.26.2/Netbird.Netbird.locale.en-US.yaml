  Release notes
  Enhancements:
  New posture check: Peer network ranges
  We have added a new posture check that allows you to define a set of IP ranges a device must be in before connecting to the network. This check is useful when you want to control access based on a network a peer is located. e.g., you can disable a connection to a routing peer when the peer is connecting from your office network range:
  https://docs.netbird.io/how-to/manage-posture-checks#peer-network-range-checkSee example below:
  Add support for downloading geolocation databases to the management service
  Now, the management service will download the geolocation databases automatically. This feature is useful for self-hosted users using the geolocation posture check. Learn more at https://docs.netbird.io/selfhosted/geo-supportUpdated GUI icons to reflect the connection status
  We have updated the tray icon to reflect the connection status and update availability. Now you can see if the client is connected or disconnected you will see the NetBird icon alternating colors, proving a more clear view of the connection status.Connected:
