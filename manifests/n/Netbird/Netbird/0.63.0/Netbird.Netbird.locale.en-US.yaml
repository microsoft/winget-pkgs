ShortDescription: Connect your devices into a secure WireGuard®-based overlay network with SSO, MFA and granular access controls.
Description: |-
  NetBird combines a configuration-free peer-to-peer private network and a centralized access control system in a single platform, making it easy to create secure private networks for your organization or home.
  Connect. NetBird creates a WireGuard-based overlay network that automatically connects your machines over an encrypted tunnel, leaving behind the hassle of opening ports, complex firewall rules, VPN gateways, and so forth.
  Secure. NetBird enables secure remote access by applying granular access policies while allowing you to manage them intuitively from a single place. Works universally on any infrastructure.

  What's New
  Custom DNS Zones
  NetBird now supports private DNS zones, allowing you to host DNS records directly within your network without external DNS servers.
  Create zones like internal.company.io, add A, AAAA, or CNAME records, and distribute them to specific peer groups. Resolution happens locally on peers, and records propagate automatically when group membership
  changes. With search domain support enabled, peers can query short names like api instead of the full api.internal.company.io.
  Custom zones take precedence over nameserver configurations, giving you control over how specific domains resolve within your network. This works well with routed networks—map friendly names to private IPs behind
  routing peers, and NetBird handles both DNS resolution and traffic routing. Your teams access postgres.internal instead of remembering 192.168.0.68.
  Zone distribution is group-based, so different teams can see different records for the same zone, or have access to entirely separate zones.
  Use Cases
  - Environment separation — Distinct zones for production, staging, and development, distributed only to relevant teams
  - Routed network resources — DNS names for services in data centers or cloud VPCs accessed through routing peers
  - Split-horizon DNS — Internal-only resolution for domains that resolve differently outside your network
