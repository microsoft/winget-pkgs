ShortDescription: Connect your devices into a secure WireGuard®-based overlay network with SSO, MFA and granular access controls.
Description: |-
  NetBird combines a configuration-free peer-to-peer private network and a centralized access control system in a single platform, making it easy to create secure private networks for your organization or home.
  Connect. NetBird creates a WireGuard-based overlay network that automatically connects your machines over an encrypted tunnel, leaving behind the hassle of opening ports, complex firewall rules, VPN gateways, and so forth.
  Secure. NetBird enables secure remote access by applying granular access policies while allowing you to manage them intuitively from a single place. Works universally on any infrastructure.

  What's New
  Native SSH Access & OpenSSH Integration
  NetBird v0.60.0 ships a complete rewrite of SSH access. Every peer can now run a built-in SSH server, giving you identity-aware, private SSH access over your NetBird network — using either the netbird ssh command or your existing OpenSSH clients.
  Highlights
  - Built-in SSH server on every peer - Enable with netbird up --allow-server-ssh and get a native SSH endpoint without exposing port 22 to the internet.
  - Identity-aware access with JWT - SSH sessions are authenticated via your IdP (OIDC/JWT) by default, so you know which user accessed which machine.
  - Works with netbird ssh and OpenSSH - Use netbird ssh user@<peer-ip> or standard ssh, sftp, and scp commands; NetBird configures OpenSSH automatically via a drop-in 99-netbird.conf.
  - Port 22, transparently secured - NetBird listens on TCP 22022 and redirects NetBird-network port 22 traffic to it, so existing SSH workflows keep working without changing ports.
  - Advanced features when you need them - Optional SFTP, local and remote port forwarding, root login, and JWT token caching (--ssh-jwt-cache-ttl) for fewer auth prompts.
  - Machine identity mode (legacy behavior) - Prefer host-based trust? Disable JWT auth with --disable-ssh-auth and rely purely on network-level ACLs.
  How it works
  1. Enable the SSH server on the target peer
  netbird down  # if already running
  netbird up --allow-server-ssh
  Add optional flags for SFTP, port forwarding, or root login as needed:
  netbird up --allow-server-ssh \
    --enable-ssh-local-port-forwarding \
    --enable-ssh-remote-port-forwarding \
    --enable-ssh-sftp \
    --enable-ssh-root
  2. Create an ACL policy for SSH
     Allow TCP port 22022 from your SSH client peers/groups to your SSH server peers/groups in Access Control.
  3. Enable SSH in the Dashboard
     Open the target peer → enable SSH Access.
  4. Connect via CLI or OpenSSH
  - NetBird CLI:
  netbird ssh user@100.119.230.104
  - OpenSSH:
  ssh user@100.119.230.104
  sftp user@100.119.230.104
  scp file.txt user@100.119.230.104:/path

  Client Improvements
  - Updated the client login success page with an improved user experience.
    #4797
  - Reverted deprecated gRPC client code migration to restore expected behavior.
    #4805

  Management Improvements
  - Fixed handling of port ranges in route firewall rules to ensure accurate rule application.
    #4801

  Upgrade & Compatibility Notes
  - ⚠️ NetBird SSH in v0.60.0 is a breaking change:
    - Server port changed from 44338 → 22022
    - Authentication moved from machine public keys to JWT-based user identity
    - Implicit firewall rules were removed - you now need an explicit ACL for port 22022
  - ⚠️ Version compatibility: v0.60.0+ SSH is not backward compatible with older peers.
    For self-hosted environments, we recommend updating in this order:
    1. Management server
    2. Dashboard (for browser SSH, if used)
    3. SSH servers first (peers with --allow-server-ssh)
    4. SSH clients last (netbird ssh users)
