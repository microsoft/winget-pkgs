  🛡️ Security Fix: Race Condition in Role Update Validation
  What was affected
  A race condition in the user role validation logic could allow permission checks to succeed based on stale role data. Under very specific timing conditions, concurrent requests during a role change (e.g., while an admin was being demoted to user) could bypass role validation when changing another users role.
  Exploit Potential
  If an administrator account was being demoted while simultaneously performing acocunt ownership transfer actions, a race window existed where the system could treat the user as having elevated permissions to change owners.
  In a coordinated scenario involving two administrator accounts, this could potentially allow privilege escalation — for example, promoting a user to Owner during the demotion window.
  Conditions Required
  Exploitation required:
  - Two administrator accounts.
  - One administrator being actively demoted.
  - Concurrent ownership transfer requests executed precisely during the demotion process.
  - Precise timing to trigger the race condition.
  This issue required intentional coordination and timing, making it unlikely to occur accidentally and will require access to two admin accounts.
