ReleaseNotes: "Release notes\nNew features\nPeer session expiration notification\nThe NetBird client will notify users when they peer session expires.For systems running the GUI client it will send a system notification similar to the example below:\nAnd when there is no CLI running, the daemon service will notify all active terminal sessions as the example below:\nimageEnhancements:\nNetBird status command reports DNS server addresses and routes\nThe netbird status command now reports the DNS server addresses and routes for the peer. This information helps troubleshoot network connectivity issues and verify the network configuration. In the case of a routing client, it will link the active routes to the selected routing peers.

See examples below:\n\nnetbird service install --service netbird-custom\nnetbird service start --service netbird-custom\nnetbird service stop --service netbird-custom\n\nBig thanks to @nazarewk for this contribution and all the work he is doing in maintaining the NetBird Nix packages up to date.An additional connection retry mechanism\nWe have added an additional connection retry mechanism to the client, where even after the client exits its normal connectivity flow, it will try a new connection attempt every hour for 14 days. This is useful for clients that restart right at the moment of a Management service outage and for incorrect management responses that cause the client to exit its other layers of connectivity retries.What's Changed\n- Add reverse proxy settings to management.json template (#1639)\n- Update bug-issue-report.md label (#1640)\n- Add quotes to timestamp examples in openapi spec  (#1642)\n- Add open-source network security image (#1643)\n- Enable review linter with exported docs check (#1647)\n- Log version when starting management and signal (#1649)\n- Fix cloud information not stored (#1651)\n- Enhance DNS failover reliability (#1637)\n- Send UI notification on peer session expiry (#1646)\n- Register creation time for peer, user and account (#1654)\n- Handle canceling schedule and avoid recursive call (#1636)\n- Do not fail on virtualized windows systems (#1669)\n- Return 1s when next expiration is too low (#1672)\n- add ansible collections contributions (#1675)\n- Send terminal notification on peer session expiry (#1660)\n- Check for record not found when searching the store (#1686)\n- Add fallback retry to daemon (#1690)\n- add --service/-s flag for specifying system service name (#1691)\n- Add routes and dns servers to status command (#1680)\nBig thanks to our community contributors\n- @zined made their first contribution in (#1669)\nFull Changelog: https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/compare/v0.26.2...v0.26.3"
