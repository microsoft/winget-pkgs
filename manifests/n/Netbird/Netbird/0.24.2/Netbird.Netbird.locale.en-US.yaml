ReleaseNotes: |-
  Release notes
  These release notes summarize what happened in the previous, 0.23, and now with the 0.24 release. There are cool new features and long-awaited enhancements that we want to share.New features
  Mark match domains as search domains
  We added support to mark a match domain as a search domain in your peers' systems. See the configuration option below:The client support was added as part of the release v0.24.0.
  This option makes ping or accessing internal nodes easier by simply using their hostname. See example below:

  ping -c 4 server

  PING server.corporate.internal (10.75.251.48): 56 data bytes

  Ephemeral peers
  When creating a setup key, you can enable an option to make all peers activated by the setup key ephemeral peer. See the option below:Ephemeral peers will be deleted from the management system after 10 minutes of disconnection. This feature allows for use cases like running agents on containers, auto-scaling groups, and even CI/CD; checkout this great contribution from @Alemiz112: Routing groups
  We have added support to routing group in the network routes feature; it allows administrators to configure groups, combined with setup keys auto-groups to automatically assign new peers as routers for a specific network range. Combine this with ephemeral peers to have stateless routers:SQLite store
  We added experimental support to SQLite for the Management service store. See docs at https://docs.netbird.io/selfhosted/sqlite-storeThis store is note recommended for production
  JWT group sync
  For self-hosted deployments, we made available an option to synchronize user groups from their JWT tokens. See image below:Each IDP has its way of configuring JWT claims, but the only requirement from our side is to send the list of groups in a single claim. We are looking for contributions to update our documentation for the various IDPs that can be integrated with NetBird.Talking about that, we added support to JumpCloud IDP; see docs here: https://docs.netbird.io/selfhosted/identity-providers#jump-cloudEnhancements:
  Refresh button
  Now you can refresh the list of resources in your account by using a refresh button:
  User deletion
  Account administrators can now delete users. See example below:Be aware that the peers that belong to the deleted user will be removed from the account.User group propagation
  We now support group propagation from users to the peers they own:What's Changed
