ReleaseNotes: |-
  Access Control for Network Routes
    Starting with version 0.30.0, users can assign access control groups to network routes, offering improved security and traffic restrictions. Route access is now unidirectional, ensuring traffic complies with the specified policies before authorization. This feature enhances the flexibility of network management.

    To configure this, follow the documentation: Configuring routes with access control.
