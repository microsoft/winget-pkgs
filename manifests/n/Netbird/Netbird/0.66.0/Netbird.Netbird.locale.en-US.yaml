ShortDescription: Connect your devices into a secure WireGuard®-based overlay network with SSO, MFA and granular access controls.
Description: |-
  NetBird combines a configuration-free peer-to-peer private network and a centralized access control system in a single platform, making it easy to create secure private networks for your organization or home.
  Connect. NetBird creates a WireGuard-based overlay network that automatically connects your machines over an encrypted tunnel, leaving behind the hassle of opening ports, complex firewall rules, VPN gateways, and so forth.
  Secure. NetBird enables secure remote access by applying granular access policies while allowing you to manage them intuitively from a single place. Works universally on any infrastructure.

  🚀 New Feature: netbird expose
  We're excited to introduce netbird expose --- a simple and secure way to expose your local services through the NetBird reverse proxy.
  ⚡ Expose Local Services with Protection
  Expose a local HTTP server:
  netbird expose 8080
  This instantly publishes your local service via NetBird's reverse proxy.
  You can enhance the exposure with built-in protection and customization:
  🔐 With PIN protection (6 digits)
  netbird expose 3000 --with-pin 123456
  🔑 With password protection and name prefix
  netbird expose 8080 --with-password my-secret --with-name-prefix my-app
  👥 Restrict by SSO user groups
  netbird expose 8080 --with-user-groups engineering,devops
  🌐 Use a custom domain (pre-configured in your account)
  netbird expose 8080 --with-custom-domain app.example.com
  Supported Flags
  -  --with-pin string --- Protect the exposed service with a 6-digit
    PIN\
  -  --with-password string --- Add password protection\
  -  --with-user-groups strings --- Restrict access to specific user
    groups\
  -  --with-custom-domain string --- Specify a custom domain\
  -  --with-name-prefix string --- Prefix the generated service name\
  -  --protocol string --- Protocol to use (http or https, default
    http)
  ⚠️ NetBird Cloud support is coming soon with hosted proxy nodes. ⚠️
