ShortDescription: Connect your devices into a secure WireGuard®-based overlay network with SSO, MFA and granular access controls.
Description: |-
  NetBird combines a configuration-free peer-to-peer private network and a centralized access control system in a single platform, making it easy to create secure private networks for your organization or home.
  Connect. NetBird creates a WireGuard-based overlay network that automatically connects your machines over an encrypted tunnel, leaving behind the hassle of opening ports, complex firewall rules, VPN gateways, and so forth.
  Secure. NetBird enables secure remote access by applying granular access policies while allowing you to manage them intuitively from a single place. Works universally on any infrastructure.

  Highlights
  [management] Setup key improvements #2775
  - We added support to setup-key deletion, allowing account cleanup of revoked or expired keys.
  - The max expiration time was removed, allowing users to define any date for key expiration.
  - Setup-keys are now stored as hashs, improving security for systems.
  Because of a database migration where the setup-keys are being hashed, a downgrade is no longer possible without restoring a backup. So, testing and making sure a backup is done before upgrading is highly recommended. See backup docs here: https://docs.netbird.io/selfhosted/selfhosted-guide#backup
