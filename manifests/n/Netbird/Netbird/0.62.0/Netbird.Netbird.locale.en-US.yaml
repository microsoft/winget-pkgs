ShortDescription: Connect your devices into a secure WireGuard®-based overlay network with SSO, MFA and granular access controls.
Description: |-
  NetBird combines a configuration-free peer-to-peer private network and a centralized access control system in a single platform, making it easy to create secure private networks for your organization or home.
  Connect. NetBird creates a WireGuard-based overlay network that automatically connects your machines over an encrypted tunnel, leaving behind the hassle of opening ports, complex firewall rules, VPN gateways, and so forth.
  Secure. NetBird enables secure remote access by applying granular access policies while allowing you to manage them intuitively from a single place. Works universally on any infrastructure.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  What's New
  🔓 Simplified Identity Provider Management
  Self-hosted NetBird no longer requires an external identity provider by default. Local users now work out of the box without any IdP dependency.
  What's changed:
  - No IdP required - Create and manage users directly from the Dashboard
  - Multiple IdP support - Configure Pocket ID, Auth0, Google, Microsoft, Okta, or any OIDC provider directly from the Dashboard
  - New quickstart script - Simpler deployment with fewer containers
  export NETBIRD_DOMAIN=netbird.example.com
  curl -fsSL https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/releases/latest/download/getting-started.sh | bash
  This is available for new installations and is fully backward-compatible—existing setups will continue to work without changes. The previous Zitadel quickstart script remains available.
