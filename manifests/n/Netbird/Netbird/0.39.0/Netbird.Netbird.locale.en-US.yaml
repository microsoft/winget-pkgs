ShortDescription: Connect your devices into a secure WireGuard®-based overlay network with SSO, MFA and granular access controls.
Description: |-
  NetBird combines a configuration-free peer-to-peer private network and a centralized access control system in a single platform, making it easy to create secure private networks for your organization or home.
  Connect. NetBird creates a WireGuard-based overlay network that automatically connects your machines over an encrypted tunnel, leaving behind the hassle of opening ports, complex firewall rules, VPN gateways, and so forth.
  Secure. NetBird enables secure remote access by applying granular access policies while allowing you to manage them intuitively from a single place. Works universally on any infrastructure.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  What's New
  This release includes support for traffic events captured between peers and resources and other peers in the network. We are also adding support to the Redis cache for IDP data. This allows a more persistent cache across management restarts.
  Traffic events support (Cloud-only)
  We’ve made significant progress on network traffic observability by adding Traffic events support and enhancing event metadata. The updates include:

  - Traffic events support on client. #3414
  These changes help you gain deeper visibility into traffic flows within your network.
