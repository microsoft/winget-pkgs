ShortDescription: Connect your devices into a secure WireGuard®-based overlay network with SSO, MFA and granular access controls.
Description: |-
  NetBird combines a configuration-free peer-to-peer private network and a centralized access control system in a single platform, making it easy to create secure private networks for your organization or home.
  Connect. NetBird creates a WireGuard-based overlay network that automatically connects your machines over an encrypted tunnel, leaving behind the hassle of opening ports, complex firewall rules, VPN gateways, and so forth.

  What's New
  🚨 Security Fix
  Security: Fixed account impersonation validation in management API
  Fixed a vulnerability in the management server's authentication middleware where the ?account= query parameter could be used to impersonate arbitrary accounts without proper validation when getting a list of accessible peers. It requires the attacker to have prior knowledge of the target accounts' and peer IDs.
  The fix adds explicit validation via IsValidChildAccount() before allowing account switching. Account impersonation is now only permitted when the target account is confirmed as a legitimate child account of the
  requesting user's parent account.
  Affected component: Management server HTTP middleware (auth_middleware.go) and /api/peers/<peer_id>/accessible-peers endpoint
  Severity: High — an authenticated user could potentially access or act on behalf of accounts they should not have access to by passing an arbitrary account parameter and fetching the list of accessible peers.
  Recommendation: All self-hosted deployments should upgrade to this version.
