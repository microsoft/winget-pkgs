ShortDescription: Connect your devices into a secure WireGuard®-based overlay network with SSO, MFA and granular access controls.
Description: |-
  NetBird combines a configuration-free peer-to-peer private network and a centralized access control system in a single platform, making it easy to create secure private networks for your organization or home.
  Connect. NetBird creates a WireGuard-based overlay network that automatically connects your machines over an encrypted tunnel, leaving behind the hassle of opening ports, complex firewall rules, VPN gateways, and so forth.
  Secure. NetBird enables secure remote access by applying granular access policies while allowing you to manage them intuitively from a single place. Works universally on any infrastructure.

  Release notes
  With this release, we are introducing a new concept in NetBird called Networks. This concept improves the administration of routed resources and provides greater visibility into what is shared with peers. Networks are configuration containers that map your on-premise or cloud networks in a logical set of configurations, making it easier to manage and share routes with your peers based on your infrastructure.
  Support for Networks will be available for our cloud-hosted systems in the next few days.
  You can find out more information about Networks here: Concept Routing traffic to multiple IP resources Accessing restricted website domain resources Accessing entire domains within networks
