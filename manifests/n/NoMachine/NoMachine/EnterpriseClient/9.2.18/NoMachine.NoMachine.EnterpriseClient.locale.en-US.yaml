ShortDescription: Get access to all your remote PCs and desktop computers where you have provided a NoMachine server product. Do that with a minimal install, including only the client-side components of the NoMachine software suite.
Description: Enterprise Client enables fast and secure access to your remote PC or desktop computer where you have installed one of the NoMachine server products. It provides a powerful connection interface, named the NoMachine Player, packed with all the features you need to work with your remote desktop. This package is available for those who prefer just a standalone "client-side" application, either because regulatory requirements dictate that connecting clients must stay as thin clients, or simply because a scaled-down client app is your personal preference. It's free to download and can be used to connect remotely from any Windows, Linux, Mac, ARM or Raspberry device to a computer where you have installed a NoMachine Enterprise product or the NoMachine Free Edition.
