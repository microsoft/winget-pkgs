Description: NoMachine Workgroup Cloud Server centralizes user access through a single gateway allowing NoMachine client devices to connect securely from outside the corporate network to remote desktops and servers residing inside. It is tailored for small teams and allows up to 10 simultaneous connections. Since any number of NoMachine nodes such as Enterprise Desktops or even Terminal Servers can be added to it, this mini connection broker is perfect for set-ups where there are multiple NoMachine-enabled desktops and computers, but only a few users requesting offsite remote access at any given time.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  NoMachine makes available new version 9 packages to provide updates to third party libraries shipped with NoMachine software and to fix a number of issues affecting previous versions. The nxhtd and libexpat libraries, now based on httpd 2.4.66 and expat v2.7.3, incorporate fixes for CVE-2025-65082 and CVE-2025-59375, respectively. Whilst NoMachine may not be directly impacted by these vulnerabilities, keeping library versions up to date is essential for overall security and compatibility. This release additionally implements improvements to NoMachine's load-balancing custom algorithm by allowing NoMachine virtual desktops to be load-balanced among the nodes of an Enterprise Terminal Server according to the RAM usage on the nodes.
