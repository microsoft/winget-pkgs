Description: NoMachine Workgroup Cloud Server centralizes user access through a single gateway allowing NoMachine client devices to connect securely from outside the corporate network to remote desktops and servers residing inside. It is tailored for small teams and allows up to 10 simultaneous connections. Since any number of NoMachine nodes such as Enterprise Desktops or even Terminal Servers can be added to it, this mini connection broker is perfect for set-ups where there are multiple NoMachine-enabled desktops and computers, but only a few users requesting offsite remote access at any given time.
