ShortDescription: A powerful, resilient gateway to your entire desktop and server infrastructure with integrated high-availability and load-balancing capabilities providing automatic failover in the case of a server outage.
Description: Enterprise Cloud Server Cluster sits at the top of the NoMachine server stack, enabling organizations to converge unlimited user access to hosted desktops and server-based resources, as well as mitigate system or site failures through its built-in fail-over protection. By pairing two Enterprise Cluster Cloud Servers administrators can create an efficient and highly-available cluster to ensure continuity of service to users’ desktops and applications should there be an outage of one of the servers. If one Enterprise Cluster Cloud Server fails, user logins continue to be processed by the other server in the cluster. Tailored for organizations with large-scale deployments, it provides a secure, central gateway to remote desktops and computers hosted inside the corporate network. These resources can be any of the servers from the NoMachine for Enterprise range and also “foreign” X servers, permitting administrators to build a flexibile & highly available multi-tier infrastructure.
