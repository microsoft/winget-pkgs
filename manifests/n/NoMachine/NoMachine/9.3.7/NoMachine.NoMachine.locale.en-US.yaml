ReleaseNotes: |-
  NoMachine makes available new version 9 packages to provide updates to third party libraries shipped with NoMachine software and to fix a number of issues affecting previous versions. The nxhtd and libexpat libraries, now based on httpd 2.4.66 and expat v2.7.3, incorporate fixes for CVE-2025-65082 and CVE-2025-59375, respectively. Whilst NoMachine may not be directly impacted by these vulnerabilities, keeping library versions up to date is essential for overall security and compatibility. This release additionally implements improvements to NoMachine's load-balancing custom algorithm by allowing NoMachine virtual desktops to be load-balanced among the nodes of an Enterprise Terminal Server according to the RAM usage on the nodes.
