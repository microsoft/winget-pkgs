Description: NoMachine Cloud Server provides centralized remote access for up to 20 connections. Suitable for teams and small departments, it allows any organization to converge point-of-entry to desktops and computers on the corporate network. Administrators can securely consolidate access to NoMachine-enabled hosts, such as Enterprise Desktops, which have been added to the gateway, making sure that those resources are never exposed to the internet.
