ReleaseNotes: |-
  * As quantum computing advances, so do our measures to protect your data. You can now enable post-quantum encryption against the cyber threats of the future. It’s always better to be prepared than to wish you were. Or, as they say: "Be quantum-proof."
  * Being offline won’t turn off auto-connect anymore. It’ll just pause and reconnect you as soon as you’re back online.
  * Colors are slightly different now to make things easier on the eyes.
  * Connection statuses are more consistent across all screens. Because consistency is cool.
