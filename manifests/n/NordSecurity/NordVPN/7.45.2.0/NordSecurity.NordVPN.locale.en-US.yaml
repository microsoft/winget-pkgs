ReleaseNotes: |-
  * The “Report a problem” form will enjoy a well-earned rest. We loved its old-school charm, but simplicity wins the round. The new “Help” section is now coming to your aid instead — you can easily reach our Support Center for quick answers or run diagnostics if something’s not working quite right.
  * We’ve also done a bit of housekeeping to fix a few bugs and polish some rough edges.
