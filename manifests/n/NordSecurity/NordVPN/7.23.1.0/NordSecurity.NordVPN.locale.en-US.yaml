ReleaseNotes: |-
  * We've introduced three new statuses to our Meshnet file sharing feature to keep you better informed about the progress of your file transfers. “Finalizing” will show up when you're finishing the transfer of the big files. When we’re checking files before resuming interrupted transfers, “Verifying” comes into play. “Queued” means  your file is waiting its turn in line.
  * A variety of fixes and improvements that might not make headlines but will definitely make your NordVPN experience smoother.
