ReleaseNotes: |-
  * The app is now better at detecting when your internet connection drops. If this happens while you’re using the VPN, our app will now automatically try to reconnect.
  * File sharing in Meshnet just leveled up. Drag files straight onto a peer device, and they’ll be sent instantly. Whether you're on the dashboard or the “File transfers” tab, sharing is just a drag away.
  * We improved the uniqueness of device identifiers in Meshnet. Now even cloned virtual machines are treated as different devices.
