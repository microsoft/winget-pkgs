ReleaseNotes: |-
  * We've added more virtual location markers throughout the app. You'll find these handy markers on the map, in your recent connections, and in the “Auto-connect” settings.
  * After a bit of a journey, DNS filtering landed in the “Connections” settings, ready to fend off unwanted content. Now available for everyone with a Basic subscription.
  * Meshnet boasts new improvements:
  - You can now completely remove any device from Meshnet.
  - No more switching between tabs – personal and external devices are shown together.
  - New color cues help you easily distinguish between online and offline devices.
  - And the cherry on top – you can send files to offline devices directly from the dashboard. Your files will be delivered once the devices go back online.
