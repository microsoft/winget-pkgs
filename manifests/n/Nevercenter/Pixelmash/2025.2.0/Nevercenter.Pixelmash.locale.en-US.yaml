ShortDescription: Resolution-independent pixel art software. A revolutionary new approach to pixel art, now available on MacOS and Windows.
Description: |-
  Pixelmash is a new kind of pixel art and animation tool that makes quick work of some of the hardest parts of pixel art, letting you use high-res and vector-based layers alongside low-res per-pixel layers.
  High-res and vector layers are non-destructively pixelated to low resolution in real-time, giving you incredibly powerful new ways to make pixel art using transforms, tweening, and advanced layer effects!

  - Create rigged characters using parented layers for easy character animation with keyframes.
  - Create template files with layers and effects pre-set-up to easily create amazing art.
  - Mix and match traditional pixel-perfect, vector, and dynamic-resolution layers.
  - It's easy to make a ton of assets at different resolutions from vector and high-res artwork.
  - There are infinite ways to combine layer effects for easily-editable, non-destructive pixel art.
  - Import high-res art or SVG files, animate it with transforms, and use layer effects for outlines and other effects.

  You can try Pixelmash free for 7 days. At any point, you can purchase a license to unlock the time restriction and register the program on your system.
