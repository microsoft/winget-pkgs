Description: |
  NumeRe: Framework for Numerical Computations is an application for Microsoft Windows® that can do more than the usual spreadsheets. It provides you with nonlinear fits of arbitrary functions as well as a ODE solver. It can display 1D and 2D data easily and publication-ready with a simple command. Fourier transforms are included as well as wavelet transforms. Data is managed in a table-based manner and automatically saved, so you can quickly resume after a restart.
  SIMPLE TASKS ARE SIMPLE - We never understood why you have to write as much code for simple things as for more complex tasks. Our mantra is therefore Keep simple things simple.
  SYNTAX AS INTUITIVE AS A LANGUAGE - The main goal is to be as intuitive as possible, which implies a syntax that is as simple and clear as possible. NumeRe does not try to be dynamically typed, but deliberately emphasizes that you understand what is happening as soon as you read the code. In addition, the advanced editor highlights different data structures in different colors, so the syntax may seem a bit "colorful and choppy" at first. But we can guarantee that you will appreciate it very soon.
  STRUCTURE BUILT IN - When writing procedures, the deeply-integrated namespaces help you to keep order right away, because each folder automatically corresponds to a namespace. This makes it possible to have several procedures with the same name that are still unique. The editor supports you by auto-completion, as well as by displaying tooltips that show documentation and signatures of functions, commands and procedures.
