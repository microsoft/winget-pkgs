ShortDescription: NextDNS CLI is a DNS53 to DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) proxy with advanced capabilities to get the most out of the NextDNS service.
Description: |-
  NextDNS CLI is a DNS53 to DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) proxy with advanced capabilities to get
  the most out of the NextDNS service.
  Although the most advanced features will only work
  with NextDNS, this program can work as a client for any DoH provider or a mix of NextDNS
  + another DNS (split horizon).

  The CLI is mostly aimed at routers and UNIX based systems, but it is also a great client
  for windows and macOS for people who prefer a fully open-source clients and don't
  mind the lack of GUI.
