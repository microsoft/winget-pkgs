  Netmaker v1.5.0 Release Notes 🚀
  🚀 What’s New
  🔓 Just-In-Time Access (beta)
  - Time-limited, on-demand network access: users request access, admins approve or deny, and grants expire automatically.
  - Request/approval workflow with configurable grant duration; admins retain full control over who accesses which networks and when.
  🔁 Overlapping Egress Ranges (beta)
  - Virtual NAT mode enables multiple egress routers to share overlapping IP ranges by assigning each egress a virtual range from a configurable pool.
  - Configurable per-network IPv4 pool and site prefix length for virtual range allocation.
  - Eliminates routing conflicts when multiple sites need to egress the same destination CIDRs (e.g., multiple offices routing to the same cloud VPC).
  - Supports both direct NAT and virtual NAT modes for flexible egress configurations.
  🌍 Gateway Monitoring
  - Desktop App connections automatically fail over to healthy gateway hubs when the primary becomes unavailable.
  - Gateway health is monitored via connectivity checks and last-seen metrics; only online gateways are used for new connections.
  🧰 Improvements & Fixes
  - IP Detection Interval User can now choose the Device Endpoint IP detection interval based on their requirements.
  - User Migration: Optimized user migration logic to reduce server startup time.
  - DNS: Use Global Nameservers only if no match-all nameservers are configured, added fallback nameserver configuration.
  - Darwin: Netclients on macOS can now use internet gateway.
  - GeoLocation: Consolidate IP location API usage with fallbacks
  Known Issues 🐞
  - netclients cannot auto-upgrade on ipv6-only machines.
  - Need to optimize multi-network netclient join with enrollment key
  - On systems using systemd-resolved in uplink mode, the first 3 entries in resolv.conf are used and rest are ignored. So it might cause DNS issues. Stub mode is preferred.
  - When a Windows desktop app is connected to a Full Tunnel Gateway, and a Split Tunnel Gateway at the same time,
    the gateway monitoring component would disconnect from the split tunnel gateway.
