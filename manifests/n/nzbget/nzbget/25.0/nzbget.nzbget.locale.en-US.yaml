ReleaseNotes: |-
  What's Changed
  - Features:
      - Completion and downloaded data statistics #544
          - added a new "Statistics" page to display completion and download volume analytics for news-servers.
          - the API method "resetservervolumes" now allows for selective resetting of counters. Arguments:
              - ServerId (int) - Server ID to reset.
              - Counter (string) - Specifies which counter to reset. The behavior depends on the value of this argument:
                  - "CUSTOM" (case-sensitive) - Resets only the custom counter associated with the server. Use this option to clear custom statistics while preserving overall download volume data.
                  - "" (empty string) - Resets all counters associated with the server, including the overall download volume and any custom counters.
          - the API method "servervolumes" now returns 2 additional properties:
              - CountersResetTime (int) - Date/time of the last reset of all counters (time is in C/Unix format).
              - ArticlesPerDays (struct[]) - Per-day amount of failed and success articles since program installation. Contains an array of structs with following fields:
                  - Failed (int) - Amount of failed articles.
                  - Success (int) - Amount of success articles.
      - Flatpak support #550
      - Snap support #559
      - Added support of running Docker image rootless #541
  - Bug fixes:
      - Deobfuscation: handle hashed filenames with a length of 16 or more #548
      - Direct unpack failures when processing non-archive files #549
      - Fixed found memory leaks, potential ub, buffer overflows, cppcheck and compiler warnings #552 #561
      - Correctly decode Unicode escape sequences in JsonDecode #560
  - For Developers:
      - Updated Docker, Libraries, Unpackers #555
          - updated Docker base image (alpine:3.19.1 -> alpine:3.21.3) and Dockerfile
          - updated and synced libraries versions for all installers (previous versions specified for Linux installers):
              - LibXML2 2.12.4 -> 2.13.5
              - ncurses 6.4 -> 6.5
              - Gzip 1.3.1
              - OpenSSL 3.1.2 -> 3.4.1
              - Boost 1.84
          - updated unpackers for installers:
              - 7-Zip 24.05 -> 24.08
              - UnRAR 7.0 -> 7.11 (Windows x32 7.01, no newer version available)
          - updated FreeBSD build script and workflow to build on Ubuntu 24.04
      - Fixed app build, using Xcode CMake generator #538
      - Fixed TOOLCHAIN_PREFIX were not used by the project (warning) #543
      - Fixed a build issue on systems lacking native atomic library support #562
      - Removed GnuTLS support #554
          - Reasons for removing GnuTLS support:
              - Maintenance overhead. Maintaining support for two SSL/TLS libraries (OpenSSL and GnuTLS) significantly increases our maintenance burden. Currently, we exclusively use OpenSSL in all production builds.
              - Boost.Asio incompatibility. The Boost.Asio library, which can be used for cross-platform socket and TLS handling, does not support GnuTLS. Our planned migration of network logic to Boost.Asio makes GnuTLS support redundant.
