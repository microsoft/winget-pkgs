  What's Changed
  - Features:
      - Automatic category detection from NZB file metadata #615:
          - The API method append now has a new argument:
              - AutoCategory (bool) - If true, the category will be automatically detected from the NZB file (if available);
          - Extended web UI with "Auto-detect category" checkbox in upload dialog;
          - Introduced a CategorySource option for RSS feeds, providing granular control over where category information is retrieved;
      - Added an option to disable the _unpack intermediate folder when unpacking.
  This allows for immediate access to files during the unpacking process #617.
  - Bug fixes:
      - Fixed macOS x64 Mojave support #613.
  - For developers:
  - Integrated the Boost.Filesystem library for cross-platform file system operations.
  We're using Boost.Filesystem to ensure compatibility with older systems
  and plan to transition to the std::filesystem library in the future #636;
  - Updated unrar:
      - Linux: from 7.11 to 7.13;
      - macOS: from 7.11 to 7.12;
      - Windows: from 7.11 to 7.13.
