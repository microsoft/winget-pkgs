  Improvements
  - Bundling OS-specific dependencies only when needed
  - This removes a file from Windows bundles that tripped Windows Defender into finding a false positive
  - Importing: ensuring arbitrarily large notes collections containing arbitrarily many files with the same name are still imported correctly, assuming the underlying importing library can parse the collection in the first place
  Bug Fixes
  - Editor: disabled automatic clipboard copying when selecting in favor of being able to create multiple cursors while dragging with the middle click (Linux)
  - Ensuring both creation date and modification date are updated when duplicating a note
  - Ensuring paste actions when dragging with the middle click are only prevented inside the editor (Linux)
  - Fixed misalignment in loose task lists
  - Fixed some regexes that were wrongly expecting to match at least one character in certain places
  - Multi-cursors: using “Ctrl+MouseEvent” rather than “Alt+MouseEvent” as the latter switches the focus to the menu bar (Windows)
