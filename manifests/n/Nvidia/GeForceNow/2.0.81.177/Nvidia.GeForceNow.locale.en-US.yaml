ReleaseNotes: |-
  CES 2026 Announcement Summary
  - GeForce NOW is expanding to more platforms than ever, highlighted by a native Linux PC app entering beta early this year and a dedicated app for Amazon Fire TV devices also launching early this year.
  - Flight-simulation fans will gain flight controls support, while members everywhere will enjoy faster access to more games through a new Gaijin.net single sign-on integration.
  - Members can follow updates on these upcoming features and new game releases every GFN Thursday.

  Fit and Finish
  - The gamepad “Hold START” hotkey has been adjusted to require a longer press before opening the GeForce NOW in-game overlay, allowing the START button to function normally in supported games like ARC Raiders.
  - If a game is temporarily unavailable due to patching, its GeForce NOW detail page will now display an estimated time to completion along with any important maintenance information.

  Bug Fixes
  - General stability and performance improvements.
