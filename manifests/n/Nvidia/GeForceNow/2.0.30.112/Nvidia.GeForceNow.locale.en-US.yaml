ReleaseNotes: |-
  More Games, Smoother Than Butter!
  - In v2.0.28 of our native Windows and macOS apps we added a new feature called adaptive VSync, which reduces stutter on poor networks. This is achieved without negatively affecting latency and, in fact, reduces latency on good networks.
  - Since then we have added more games for you to try: League of Legends, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege, Rust, ARK: Survival Evolved, Path of Exile, Dota 2, The Witcher® 3: Wild Hunt, The Witcher® 3: Wild Hunt - Game of the Year
  - We will continue to add more games each month, so stay tuned!

  More Quality of Service Improvements
  - We continue to make improvements for users on congested networks that experience bursty packet loss.
  - Our latest release will help further reduce stutter, and users on these networks will see less frozen or corrupted frames.

  Apple M1 Support For Google Chrome
  - Apple’s recent Spring Forward event introduced even more Apple M1-based products, like the brand-new iMac 24-inch.
  - If you’ve got one of these on pre-order, or already have another Apple M1-based product, good news: our latest browser app now supports these products. Just point your Google Chrome browser to https://play.geforcenow.com and start gaming.

  Fit and Finish
  - We now support Arabic: !GeForce NOW مرحبًا بك في
  - We made some performance optimizations that will result in the marque, and other parts of the app, loading more quickly.

  Bugs Fixed
  - Highlights now work properly in Apex Legends.
  - When you turn on filters during search, the main app game list will no longer be filtered as well.
  - The Highlights summary now shows the correct amount of captured Highlights.

  Whatcha Thinking?
  - Tell us about your streaming session, or what games you want to play, or how you won that last match even after your teammates dropped. We read it all, and we’re proud of you.
