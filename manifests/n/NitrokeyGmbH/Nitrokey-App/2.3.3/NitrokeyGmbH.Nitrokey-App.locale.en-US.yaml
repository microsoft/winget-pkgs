ShortDescription: This application allows to manage Nitrokey 3 devices. Currently, it only allows updating the firmware of Nitrokey 3 devices. More features will be added in the future. To manage Nitrokey Pro and Nitrokey Storage devices, use the older Nitrokey App.
ReleaseNotes: |-
  This release most noteworthy changes the appearance of the Nitrokey App2 by removing the theme included. Therefore now the theming and thus appearance will depend on the system theme. Please consider reading your distribution's guide on how to apply QT themes to flatpak applications, if this is not working out-of-the-box.
  Known Issues
  - In combination with multiple Nitrokey 3s there might be situations in which the device will be shown as "old firmware", please re-plug the Nitrokey 3 in this situation, this will be fixed in the next release
  - After confirming an update an empty confirmation dialog appears, which is reserved for "extra information" inside the firmware package, but not properly hidden in case of an empty "extra information"
