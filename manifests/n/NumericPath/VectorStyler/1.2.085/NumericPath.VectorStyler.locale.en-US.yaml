  VectorStyler provides a complete set of drawing, design and illustration tools necessary for modern design. With its numerous new features, VectorStyler redefines and extends the tools available for illustrators and designers, improving the creation of complex illustrations and designs.

  Create precision vector graphics using a advanced shape editing tools. Cut and merge shapes with the Trim and Join tool. Adjust path endings and node locations along the path using the Extend Path tool. Modify shapes locally with the Offset Path tools. Simplify shapes with the precision node removal feature.

  Create and use dynamically linked symbols and styles. Changes to symbols and styles automatically propagate other the whole document. Use styles to create common attribute definitions for all aspects of objects, including color, outline, content or formatting. Use number variables to define common number attributes.

  Use variable and color fonts to create typographic effects. Set text along any path and use bending with variable width profile to stretch text on a path. Setup multicolumn text frames and flow text between multiple linked frames. Use multi-line paragraph composer for precise typography and balance text between columns.
