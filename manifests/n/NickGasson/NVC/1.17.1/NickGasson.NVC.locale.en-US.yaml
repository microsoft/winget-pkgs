ReleaseNotes: |-
  This is a minor bug fix release with the following changes:
  - Fixed a build failure on Linux Arm64 (#1246).
  - An others choice is now allowed in an unconstrained array aggregate if the --relaxed option is passed and the aggregate appears in one of the contexts where the VHDL-2019 "function knows vector size" feature applies (#641, #1175).
  - VHPI handles have been made more robust. A user-visible effect of this change is that handles with distinct pointer values may refer to the same object. Always use vhpi_compare_handles to compare handles rather than comparing the value of the handles directly.
  - Type marks like arr(index)'subtype are now parsed correctly (#1245).
  - Several other minor bugs were resolved (#1249).
