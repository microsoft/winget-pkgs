ReleaseNotes: |-
  This is a major new release with the following changes:
  - PSL next_e and next_e! operators and the nondet built-in function are now supported.
  - The --precompile elaboration option which was deprecated in the last release has been removed. The related --with-system-cc configure option has also been removed.
  - The --stderr=none option now prevents any diagnostic messages being printed to stderr, including those at failure severity (#1357).
  - The VITAL and Synopsys packages are now compiled into the ieee library for VHDL-2019 (#1360).
  - The new --relative=DIR analysis option saves all file names relative to DIR. This can be useful to ensure reproducibility of binary libraries (#1359).
  - Very large subprograms containing tens of thousands of operations can now be compiled (#1259).
  - Added -Werror analysis option to escalate warnings into errors.
  - Code coverage report style was improved and average coverage numbers are now printed after a run completes.
  - Expression coverage reporting for multi-line expressions was improved.
  - Fixed waveform dumping for arrays of enumerated types (#1362).
  - The fractional part of std.env.epoch is now correct and to_string on std.env.time_record now displays months correctly according to ISO 8601 (#1381).
  - Verilog support has improved significantly, with the ZipCPU FFT core now able to be simulated (#1336).
  - Elaboration of large netlists is now significantly faster (#1331, #1341).
  - Updated to OSVVM 2025.06a and UVVM 2025.11.28 for nvc --install.
  - Several other minor bugs were resolved (#1237, #1350, #1351, #1353, #1366, #1372, #1333, #1388, #1393, #1396, #1395).
