ReleaseNotes: |-
  Navidrome v0.58.0 Release Notes
  Navidrome v0.58.0 introduces Multi-library Support, a major architectural enhancement that enables users to organize and manage multiple music collections with proper permission controls and complete UI integration. This long-requested feature allows you to create separate libraries for different music collections (e.g., personal music, family music, audiobooks) while maintaining proper access controls and data isolation.
  For full documentation on how to use it, see the new Multi-library page in the documentation website.
  ⚠️ Important
  Full Scan
  Although this release does not force a full scan on upgrade, you should do it as soon as possible. This is because the multi-library changes affect the move/rename/retag detection and can potentially make you lose annotations (stars, playcounts, playlist references). During the full scan, it will duplicate all your albums, but that's expected. It will remove the duplicates at the end of the scan.
  Database Migration Warning
  This release includes database schema changes that are NOT reversible by simply downgrading to a previous version of Navidrome.
  Before installing this version:
  1. BACKUP YOUR DATABASE - Create a complete backup of your navidrome.db file
  2. TEST ON A COPY FIRST - If possible, test this version on a copy of your data before upgrading your main installation
  If you need to rollback:
  - Stop Navidrome
  - Restore your database backup
  - Reinstall the previous version
