ReleaseNotes: |-
  Known Bugs
  - #504
  Known issues
  - Rendering sometimes silently stalls after X frames. #248
  - Some image formats may have issues (PCX, PSB). #602
  - MTS video files are sometimes not read correctly. #186
  Changes (compared to 2.4.4)
  - Use Python 3 rather than Python 2 (which is not maintained anymore).
    This will require very few changes to the Python code (mainly print statements), and most code can be easily adapted to be 2-3 compatible. #686
  - Use QtPy==1.11.2 rather than PySide.
    QtPy is an abstraction layer for PyQt5/PyQt4/PySide2/PySide (newer versions support PyQt6/PySide6).  QtPy uses the Qt5 layout (where the QtGui module has been split into QtGui and QtWidgets).  Using QtPy guarantees a higher level of forward-compatibility with future versions of Natron, which may use Qt5 or Qt6.
    PySide can still be imported explicitly, if required, but the resulting code will not be forward-compatible.
    Note that 2.4.4 binaries include qtpy, but still import PySide by default. #687
