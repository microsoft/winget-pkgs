ReleaseNotes: |-
  Improvements:
  - A new configurable option enables selective support for Microsoft Entra FIDO2 authentication with a modified User Agent, enhancing SSO experience for customers with specific Entra settings while maintaining default behaviour for others.
  - The file naming convention for the Desktop App settings has been simplified and standardised to settings.json to enhance clarity and maintain backward compatibility.
  - New CRM Connect 5.7.0 version is rolled out with this Desktop App release. This version includes crucial bug fixes and security fixes.
  - A recording icon has been added to the floating window to indicate when a call is being recorded during transcription.
  - The floating call notification window now remains fixed on the screen with the dragging area confined to the top, allowing users to interact seamlessly with other UI elements during incoming calls.
  - The camera icon state is consistently synchronised between the main window and floating window, reflecting any changes in real time.
  - The floating window camera now switches off and on reliably during 1:1 calls.
  - The order of Do Not Disturb options has been aligned across mobile, Web and Desktop apps as well as taskbar menus to display Device DND before Global DND for a consistent user experience.
  - A close button has been added to all info modals along with descriptive tooltips for the delete and close icons to enhance user experience.
