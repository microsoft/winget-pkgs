ShortDescription: A command line utility to interact with and manage NATS.
ReleaseNotes: |-
  Major New Features
  Decentralized Authentication Management
  We have introduced some of the functionality from nsc and nk into the new nats auth command. The aim is not to support every feature nsc has but to identify the key features most users use and bring those into the nats command.
  This is an initial release and we're seeking feedback around missing features users feel are key and around the general interaction model.
  Please see AUTH.md for a testing guide.
  Configuration Scaffolding
  To complement nats auth and to help new users we introduced a new configuration generation feature set in nats server generate. This tool will guide users through interactive questions to solve goal orientated outcomes such as generating local Docker Compose development Super Clusters or connecting to Synadia Cloud using a Leafnode.
  The tool supports sharing bundles without performing new releases of the nats command and again we'd love feature requests on scaffolding you'd like to see here.
  Major nats bench rewrite
  The nats bench command has seen a major rewrite splitting it into seperate commands with options grouped around specific goals rather than all in one huge set of flags.
  Real time graphs
  We've added numerous graph features to the tooling that allow you to see traffic rates on specific subjects, in and out of streams and consumers and more.
  See:
  - nats sub --graph
  - nats stream graph
  - nats consumer graph
  - nats server graph
  nats top
  We've incorporated the nats-top command as a new sub command and made it work over NATS network rather than HTTP for consistency with all the other nats administration commands.
