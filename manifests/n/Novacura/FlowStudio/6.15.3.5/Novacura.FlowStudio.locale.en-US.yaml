ShortDescription: Administrate Flow server and develop applications.
Description: |-
  With the Novacura Flow Studio, we have created a true power tool for creating efficient, user-friendly and integrated apps providing increased growth, higher efficiency and simpler administration.
  And as usual, everything is based on step-by-step workflows. Now you can create multi-user applications, run tasks in parallel, use sub-workflows, send push notifications, get an activity live-feed, create parts of workflows that can be reused and much more. You can test run your apps directly inside Novacura Flow Studio, something that will shorten the time from idea to implementation.
  With the simplicity of Novacura Flow Studio, you can go from zero to app in just minutes, as long as you know what you want to achieve - or discover potential achievements you weren't even aware of!
