ReleaseNotes: |-
  See the assets to download this version. See the README for installation instructions.
  - chore: sync lockfile changes made by deno install after earlier commit regarding displaying GFM alerts
  - fix: skip manual render of black background colours and use CSS instead for background colour display in the UI to prevent flickering
  - fix: index more safely into an action's states in the instance editor as Toggle Action instances have more states than the base action does
