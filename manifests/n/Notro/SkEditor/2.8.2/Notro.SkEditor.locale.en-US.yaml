ReleaseNotes: |-
  👋 Hey!
  In a few days, I'll be going on vacation, so the next version will be released in September.
  Well... that didn’t age well 🥲
  If you're on the Discord server and follow my announcements, you likely already know the reasons for the extended break in SkEditor updates.
  This update isn’t huge - it’s mostly about pushing fixes, some of which have been pending for months!
  I’ll probably have something bigger coming soon, but I don’t want to make any promises I can't keep again 😅Oh, and one more thing! Happy birthday, SkEditor! We also hit 10 thousand downloads recently! 🎉Changes
  - @GliczDev and I have begun working on a built-in terminal. It’s still a work in progress, but you can try it out by pressing CTRL+Shift+`.
  - The installer was broken in previous versions and required users to run SkEditor as an administrator. If you're updating from v2.8.1, you might still encounter the same issue, but it should be fixed now.
  - Fixed the "Close project" functionality, which wasn’t working properly.
  - The "Delete" option in the project explorer is now more clearly worded to indicate that it deletes the file from the file system, and includes a confirmation screen.
  - Fixed an issue where buttons in dialog boxes weren’t being translated.
  - Adjusted margins across the app, so they should now be consistent.
  - All libraries have been upgraded. Thanks to Avalonia 11.2, the app should now start a bit faster!
  - Fixed an issue with the file icon in the project explorer not updating after renaming.
  🎉 Enjoy!
