ReleaseNotes: |-
  👋 Hello!
  This is just a small update containing a few fixes and changes. In a few days, I'm going on vacation, so the next version will appear in September - I hope it will be much bigger and finally important changes will see the light of day 😉Changes
  - Added a color picker to the "Tools" menu tab.
  - Improved the Escape button functionality in settings - when on a subpage, pressing it will return to the previous page; when on the main page, it will close the window.
  - Fixed incorrect icon size and title in the application "introduction" during first launch.
  - Removed the old API - Addon Rework added a new API, but the old one was kept and marked as deprecated - now it's gone completely.
  - Added variable name suggestions in the code completion prototype experiment.
  - Fixed a bug with the "hex preview" experiment that didn't highlight colors with a single #.
  - Multi-line comments added in Skript 2.9 will no longer be parsed by the code parser.
  - Removed the unnecessary "Session saved" debug log that appeared in the logs.
  🎉 Enjoy!
