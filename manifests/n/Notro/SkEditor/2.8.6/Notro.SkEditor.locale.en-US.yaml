ReleaseNotes: |-
  👋 Hey!
  Another few months... And I'm still returning to you with only a small update :(
  I'm working on a lot of things right now. @GliczDev is also busy working on the new Analyzer. I hope everything will start to roll out in a few months!
  I spent most of my time in recent weeks (or even months) thinking, planning, prototyping, adding, and testing things related to SkEditor. From the user perspective, it might seem that I didn't do much, but, well, I hope you believe me!
  I want to dedicate a little time from SkEditor to my other projects, though. I've been working on it like it's my full-time job (without the full-time job benefits...) and couldn't work on my other projects because of that. If I continue at this pace, I'll probably burn out completely and stop working on SkEditor altogether...
  AI Copilot
  By the way, I don't know if you're active on our Discord server - but there was a poll about features users would like to see the most and earliest, and AI Copilot won with 36% of votes. According to WakaTime, I've already spent 70 hours working on it! There's still a lot to fix, improve, and add. I plan to send testing versions to select users so I can gather feedback too.
  Changes
  - Changed the titlebar layout a little bit
  - Changed the sidebar layout and icon behavior
  - Fixed opening network folders (SMB share) (fixes #144)
  - Added Custom UI Scale option to the settings.json
  - Updated the ICO file to include multiple resolutions
  - Added "Dev tools" menu with syntax and theme reload features
  - Removed the check for outdated addons
  - Updated libraries
  🎉 Enjoy!
