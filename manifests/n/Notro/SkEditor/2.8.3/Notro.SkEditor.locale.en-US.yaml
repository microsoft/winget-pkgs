ReleaseNotes: |-
  👋 Hi!
  There was a bug in the previous build where dragging tabs caused a crash.
  It’s kind of funny - I had already fixed it, but I forgot to update the library. The fix? Simply commenting out the not working function call. And it works! Hopefully, this will not make SkEditor go boom boom...Also, one more thing: some of the menu icons have been updated.That’s all for now! I just wanted to release this update as quickly as possible.🎉 Enjoy!
