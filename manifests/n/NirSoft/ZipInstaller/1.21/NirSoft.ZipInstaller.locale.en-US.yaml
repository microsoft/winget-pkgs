ShortDescription: An installer utility that installs and uninstalls applications that do not provide an internal installation program from a Zip file.
Description: The ZipInstaller utility installs and uninstalls applications and utilities that do not provide an internal installation program. It automatically extracts all files from the Zip file, copies them to the destination folder you select, creates shortcuts in the start menu and in your desktop, and adds an uninstall module to allow you to automatically remove the software in the future.
Moniker: zipinst
ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Version 1.21:
    - Ability to create self-install executables. (/selfexe command-line parameter)
    - The 'Start In' field in all shortcuts created by ZipInstaller is now filled with the appropriate folder.
    - Uninstall improvement: if a file is locked and cannot be deleted, ZipInstaller will try to move it into the temp folder, instead of displaying error message. (This trick works only on Windows 2000/XP)
    - Fixed bug: In previous version, the configuration file inside the zip file was copied to the installation folder with all other files, although it's not really needed.
    - New option: copy the uninstaller module to the installation folder, instead of Windows folder (UninstallInDestFolder value)
