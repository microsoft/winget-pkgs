Description: |-
  FileAccessErrorView is a diagnostic tool for Windows that displays information about file access errors occur while programs running on your system try to open/read/write/delete a file.
  FileAccessErrorView displays the filename that the application tried to open/read/write/delete, the process id/name of the application, the error code (NTSTATUS code), the description of the error code, the number of times that this error occurred, and the timestamp of this error.

  After you run FileAccessErrorView, it immediately starts to trace the open/read/write/delete operation of files and displays the details when an error is detected.
  Be aware: The fact that application get an error while trying to access a file doesn't mean that something is wrong in this application. In fact, in most programs you'll see some file access errors as a normal operation of the software. However, if you have a program that hangs or crashes, this tool may give you an hint about the cause of the problem. For example: If a program hangs because it tries to access a file on a remote disconnected computer, this tool will display the network path that the program is trying to access.
