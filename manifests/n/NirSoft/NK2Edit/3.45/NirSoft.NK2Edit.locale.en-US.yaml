ShortDescription: Edit, delete, add, merge, and repair records in the AutoComplete files (.NK2) of Outlook.
Description: |-
  Every time that you type an email address or name in the message window of MS-Outlook, it automatically offer you a list of users and email address that you can choose.
  This feature is known as 'AutoComplete' and Outlook automatically build this emails list according to user activity and save it into a file with .NK2 extension.

  In some circumstances, you may need to repair or modify the values appeared in the AutoComplete list, or you may want to remove unwanted email addresses and/or to add new email addresses.
  MS-Outlook doesn't provide any ability to edit this AutoComplete list, so this is where NK2Edit software can help you.
