ShortDescription: View application crash information on Windows.
Description: |-
  AppCrashView is a small utility for Windows that displays the details of all application crashes occurred in your system.
  The crashes information is extracted from the .wer files created by the Windows Error Reporting (WER) component of the operating system every time that a crash is occurred.
  AppCrashView also allows you to easily save the crashes list to text/csv/html/xml file.
