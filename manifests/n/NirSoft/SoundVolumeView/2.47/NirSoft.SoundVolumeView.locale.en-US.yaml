ShortDescription: >
  View / change sound volume on Windows 11 / 10 / 7 / 8 / 2008 from command-line
  or GUI
Description: >
  SoundVolumeView is a simple tool for Windows Vista/7/8/2008/10/11 that
  displays general information and current volume level for all active sound
  components on your system, and allows you to mute and unmute them instantly.

  SoundVolumeView also allows you to save a sound profile into a file,
  containing the current volume level and the mute/unmute state of all sound
  components, as well as the default sound devices, and then later, load the
  same file to restore exactly the same volume levels and settings. There is
  also extensive command-line support, which allows you to save/load profiles,
  change current volume of every sound component, and mute/unmute every sound
  component, without displaying any user interface.
