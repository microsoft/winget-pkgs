ShortDescription: Copy video files (.flv and others) from the Web browser cache and temporary folder.
Description: "After watching a video in a Web site, you may want to save the video file into your local disk for playing it offline in the future.\nIf the video file is stored in your browser's cache, this utility can help you to extract the video file from the cache and save it for watching it in the future.\n\nIt automatically scans the entire cache of Internet Explorer, Mozilla-based Web browsers (Including Firefox), Opera, and Chrome, and then finds all video files that are currently stored in it.\nIt allows you to easily copy the cached video files into another folder for playing/watching them in the future.\nIf you have a movie player that is configured to play flv files, it also allows you to play the video directly from your browser's cache.
