ShortDescription: >
  Copy video files (.flv and others) from the Web browser cache and temporary
  folder.
Description: |-
  After watching a video in a Web site, you may want to save the video file into
  your local disk for playing it offline in the future. If the video file is
  stored in your browser's cache, this utility can help you to extract the video
  file from the cache and save it for watching it in the future. It automatically
  scans the entire cache of Internet Explorer, Mozilla-based Web browsers
  (Including Firefox), Opera, and Chrome, and then finds all video files that are
  currently stored in it. It allows you to easily copy the cached video files into
  another folder for playing/watching them in the future. If you have a movie
  player that is configured to play flv files, it also allows you to play the
  video directly from your browser's cache.

  Notice for users of Internet Explorer 10.0 and 11.0: In order to get videos from
  these versions of IE, you have to press F6 (Advanced Options) and choose the
  'Internet Explorer 10 Cache' option in the 'Load video files...' section.
ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Version 3.11
    - Updated to read the modified cache structure in the new versions of Chrome (Version 132).
