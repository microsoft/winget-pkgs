ShortDescription: |-
  HashMyFiles is small utility that allows you to calculate the MD5 and SHA1 hashes of one or more
  files in your system.
Description: |-
  You can easily copy the MD5/SHA1 hashes list into the clipboard, or save them into text/html/xml file.

  HashMyFiles can also be launched from the context menu of Windows Explorer, and display the
  MD5/SHA1 hashes of the selected file or folder.
ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Version 2.50:
    - Added 'Live Hashes Display' option. When it's turned on, HashMyFiles displays the hashes of
      every file immediately after they are calculated, instead of waiting until all files are
      processed.
    - Added new columns: 'Hash Start Time', 'Hash End Time', 'Hashing Duration'.
