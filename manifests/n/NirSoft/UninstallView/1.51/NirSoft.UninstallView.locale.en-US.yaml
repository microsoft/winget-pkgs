ShortDescription: Alternative uninstaller for Windows 11 / 10 / 8 / 7 / Vista
Description: |-
  UninstallView is a tool for Windows that collects information about all programs installed on your system and displays
  the details of the installed programs in one table. You can use it to get installed programs information for your local
  system, for remote computer on your network, and for external hard-drive plugged to your computer. It also allows you
  to easily uninstall a software on your local computer and remote computer (Including quiet uninstall if the installer
  supports it).

  Starting from version 1.30, you can also view and uninstall Windows Apps if the 'Load Windows Apps' option is turned on.
ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Version 1.51:
    - Added 'Black Background' option (Under the View menu). When it's turned on, the main table is displayed in black
      background and white text, instead of default system colors.
    - Added 'Full Screen' mode (View -> Full Screen or F11 key).
    - Fixed issue: When copying data to the clipboard or exporting to tab-delimited file, every line contained an empty
      field in the end of the line.
