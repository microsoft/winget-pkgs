ShortDescription: Tool for Windows that displays file operations of applications
Description: |-
  AppReadWriteCounter is a tool for Windows that counts and displays the current file read / write operations of every application running on your system. It displays the number of read/write bytes, the number of read/write operations, current calculated read/write speed, and the details about the application (product name, product version, and so on) that makes the file read/write operations.

  Immediately after running it, the main window displays every application that currently read or write files. Be aware that the counters in this tool are not per process but per application, so if you have multiple processes for the same application , AppReadWriteCounter merges them into one line. Also, if you close an application and then run it again, AppReadWriteCounter will continue the update the read/write counters of the same application entry.
  At any time, you can clear the entire list and start with empty window by pressing Ctrl+X (Clear All). You can also reset the counters of selected items by pressing Ctrl+R (Reset Selected Counters).
