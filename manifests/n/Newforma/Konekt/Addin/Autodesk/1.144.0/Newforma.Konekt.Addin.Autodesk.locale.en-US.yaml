Description: |-
  Simplify your communication workflow. Newforma Konekt centralizes communications across platforms and brings transparency and efficiency to your projects. No more time wasted searching through emails and models to find and resolve the issues that matter.
  Keep track of issues across different teams and projects. Transpose issues onto different documents in the latest version. Stay up-to-date with issue resolution progress, no matter what document or design environment you’re working in.
  Track issues found during technical coordination until they’re solved. Log issues on the fly during design review and/or coordination meetings, view complex mechanical issues in 3D in Newforma Konekt’s web viewer, and share them with team members who can resolve them directly in their authoring software.
