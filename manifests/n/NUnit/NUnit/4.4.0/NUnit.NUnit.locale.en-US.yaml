Description: |-
  A unit-testing framework for all .NET languages. It can be used for a wide range of testing, from unit testing with TDD to full fledged system and integration testing.

  Note that due to the Winget package on x64 needing at least one .NET dependency for its x64 .exe-s to pass validation, the Winget package's x64 version automatically installs the .NET 8 Runtime, regardless of whether or not the user solely intends to use the .NET 6 or 4 .exe-s. The PATH shortcut will also lead to the .NET 8 .exe by default.

  This can optionally be avoided by installing the designated x86 version with "-a x86", as the .NET 4 .exe used for x86 validation is not known to need a dependency. The PATH shortcut will however lead to the .NET 4 .exe by default.

  In either situation, a functional x64 .exe for .NET 6 is furthermore also in the package.
