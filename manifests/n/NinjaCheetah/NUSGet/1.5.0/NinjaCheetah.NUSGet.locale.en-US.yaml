ReleaseNotes: |-
  Always more to do...
  Hi everyone coming from the Wii guide :D
  Changelog
  - There is now a folder button next to the download button that opens NUSGet's output folder (including the custom directory, if one is set).
  - The way that custom download directories work has been reconfigured, and they are no longer fairly cursed on the inside!
  - Script downloads will now respect your custom download directory instead of always using the default NUSGet Downloads directory.
  - Mostly not important, but NUSGet is now built on top of Python 3.13 rather than 3.12, as I have tested that everything works as intended.
  Translations
  NUSGet is available in the following language:
  - English
  - French (@rougets)
  - German (@yeah-its-gloria)
  - Italian (@LNLenost)
  - Korean (@DDinghoya)
  - Norwegian (@DandelionSprout, @rolfiee)
  - Romanian (@NotImplementedLife)
  - Spanish (@DarkMatterCore)
  By default, titles are downloaded to the NUSGet Downloads folder, which is created in your local downloads folder. You can open this by pressing the folder icon next to the download button! (You can also set your own download folder, if you'd prefer.)
  NUSGet is powered by libWiiPy and libTWLPy.
