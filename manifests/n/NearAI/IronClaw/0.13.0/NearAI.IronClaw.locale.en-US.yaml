ShortDescription: Unleash Your AI Agent, With Peace of Mind
Description: |-
  IronClaw is the secure, open-source alternative to OpenClaw that runs in encrypted enclaves on NEAR AI Cloud. AI agents that actually do things, but your secrets never touch the LLM.

  Philosophy
  IronClaw is built on a simple principle: your AI assistant should work for you, not against you.
  In a world where AI systems are increasingly opaque about data handling and aligned with corporate interests, IronClaw takes a different approach:
  - Your data stays yours - All information is stored locally, encrypted, and never leaves your control
  - Transparency by design - Open source, auditable, no hidden telemetry or data harvesting
  - Self-expanding capabilities - Build new tools on the fly without waiting for vendor updates
  - Defense in depth - Multiple security layers protect against prompt injection and data exfiltration
  IronClaw is the AI assistant you can actually trust with your personal and professional life.

  Features
  Security First
  - WASM Sandbox - Untrusted tools run in isolated WebAssembly containers with capability-based permissions
  - Credential Protection - Secrets are never exposed to tools; injected at the host boundary with leak detection
  - Prompt Injection Defense - Pattern detection, content sanitization, and policy enforcement
  - Endpoint Allowlisting - HTTP requests only to explicitly approved hosts and paths
  Always Available
  - Multi-channel - REPL, HTTP webhooks, WASM channels (Telegram, Slack), and web gateway
  - Docker Sandbox - Isolated container execution with per-job tokens and orchestrator/worker pattern
  - Web Gateway - Browser UI with real-time SSE/WebSocket streaming
  - Routines - Cron schedules, event triggers, webhook handlers for background automation
  - Heartbeat System - Proactive background execution for monitoring and maintenance tasks
  - Parallel Jobs - Handle multiple requests concurrently with isolated contexts
  - Self-repair - Automatic detection and recovery of stuck operations
  Self-Expanding
  - Dynamic Tool Building - Describe what you need, and IronClaw builds it as a WASM tool
  - MCP Protocol - Connect to Model Context Protocol servers for additional capabilities
  - Plugin Architecture - Drop in new WASM tools and channels without restarting
  Persistent Memory
  - Hybrid Search - Full-text + vector search using Reciprocal Rank Fusion
  - Workspace Filesystem - Flexible path-based storage for notes, logs, and context
  - Identity Files - Maintain consistent personality and preferences across sessions
