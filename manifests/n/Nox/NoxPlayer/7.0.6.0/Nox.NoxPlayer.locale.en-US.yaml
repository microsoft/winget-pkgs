ShortDescription: The perfect Android emulator to play mobile games on PC
Description: |-
  NoxPlayer, the perfect and fully-optimized Android emulator to play mobile games on PC, has been providing users with the best gaming experience for 6 years. Compared with traditional emulators, NoxPlayer is the only one so far to support all versions of Android engines – 5.1, 7.1, and 9 (both 32 and 64 bit), while compatible with both X86 / AMD. NoxPlayer allows running high-performance and high-graphic mobile games on PC with extremely high compatibility and stability, and extreme frame rate.
  On NoxPlayer, users can run mobile games at any Android version (Android 5/7/9). Gaming with PC screen and keyboard, users could get both a better visual and a greater keyboard-control experience. By creating multiple instances, users can login multiple accounts, and perform "multi-tasking" – to run not only games, but also social apps, or in some circumstances, both, simultaneously.
  NoxPlayer provides the ultimate gaming experience on PC. We believe every detail matters. On NoxPlayer, gamers could experience a clearer view, an easier way to control characters, a smoother gaming experience, higher compatibility and performance, and… these won't leave us satisfied. For you, we've added features like macro, script, video recording, live mode, animated theme, and will add more in the future.
