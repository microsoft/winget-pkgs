ReleaseNotes: |-
  Added
  - Nextest now supports running tests under a debugger. Use --debugger to run a single test under gdb, lldb, WinDbg, CodeLLDB in Visual Studio Code, and other debuggers, while preserving all the environment setup done by nextest.
    Nextest's debugger support will likely see some iteration and improvements over time. If it's missing a feature, please open a feature request, or even better, send a pull request!
  - Nextest now sets NEXTEST_BIN_EXE_* environment variables with hyphens in binary names replaced by underscores, in addition to the existing variables with hyphens. This works around some shells and debuggers that drop environment variables containing hyphens. (#2777)
  Fixed
  - Fixed a panic when attempting to display progress during retries. (#2771)
  - With stress tests, the progress bar no longer overwrites unrelated output. (#2765)
  - During the list phase, invalid output lines with control characters in them are now properly escaped. (#2772)
  Other
  - Nextest's GitHub releases are now marked immutable, so for a particular version, its release binaries can't be changed by anybody after publication. (Release binaries have never changed as a matter of policy. The improvement here is that for 0.9.113 and future versions, this fact is now cryptographically attested by GitHub.)
