ReleaseNotes: |-
  Added
  - Initial support for stress tests: running tests a large number of times in a loop.
  Changed
  - The libtest-json-plus output now produces test results immediately rather than at the end of the run. This is allowed by the fact that with the libtest-json-plus output, it is possible to distinguish between different test binaries based on the additional nextest property.
    Thanks to dnbln for your first contribution!
  Fixed
  - The heuristic detection for panicked at in tests now handles the new output format in Rust nightlies (Rust 1.91 and above): on Unix platforms, the thread ID is now also included.
    Thanks again to dnbln for fixing this.
