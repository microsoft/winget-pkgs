ReleaseNotes: |-
  Changed
  - --show-progress=only now behaves like the default auto in non-interactive mode, showing successful tests with a counter. This change was made because only is primarily intended for interactive scenarios. (#3087)
  - The MSRV for building nextest has been updated to Rust 1.91.
  Fixed
  - Setup scripts that write NEXTEST-prefixed environment variables to $NEXTEST_ENV now properly report failure. Previously, the setup script would be reported as successful despite invalid variables, and tests would still run. (#3094)
  Internal improvements
  - Replay output is now only loaded from the archive when needed. This makes replays around 10-15% faster. (#3090)
  - Switched from the zip crate to eazip to address repeated semver breakage in the zip crate. (#3093)
