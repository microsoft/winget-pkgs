ReleaseNotes: |-
  Added
  - Nextest profiles now support inheritance via the inherits key. For example:
    [profile.ci]
    retries = 2
    [profile.ci-extended]
    inherits = "ci"
    slow-timeout = "120s"
    Thanks asder8215 for your first contribution! (#2786)
  - A new on-timeout option for slow-timeout allows tests that time out to be treated as successes instead of failures. This is useful for fuzz tests, or other tests where a timeout indicates no failing input was found. For example:
    [[profile.default.overrides]]
    filter = 'package(fuzz-targets)'
    slow-timeout = { period = "30s", terminate-after = 1, on-timeout = "pass" }
    Tests that time out and pass are marked TMPASS. See Configuring timeout behavior for more information.
    Thanks eduardorittner for your first contribution! (#2742)
