ReleaseNotes: |-
  Changed
  On Windows, job objects are now created with JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_BREAKAWAY_OK. This enables test processes to have their children be assigned a different job object, which is particularly relevant on Windows 7 since that platform doesn't have nested job objects.
  Thanks to Guiguiprim for the contribution!
