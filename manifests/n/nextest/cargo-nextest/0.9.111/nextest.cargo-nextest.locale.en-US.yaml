ReleaseNotes: |-
  Added
  - Nextest now supports immediately terminating currently-running tests on failure. Set fail-fast = { max-fail = 1, terminate = "immediate" } in your configuration, or use --max-fail=1:immediate, to terminate running tests as soon as the first test fails.
  Changed
  - In interactive terminals, nextest now shows 8 running tests by default underneath the progress bar. Control the maximum number of tests displayed with the --max-progress-running option.
    As part of this change, --show-progress=running is now an alias for --show-progress=bar. To only show running tests, use --show-progress=only.
  - Non-UTF-8 test output is now encoded with String::from_utf8_lossy before being printed out to the terminal. This should generally not be a visible change, since most tests produce UTF-8 output.
  - When the progress bar is displayed, nextest now writes to terminal output every 50ms.
  Fixed
  - A number of performance improvements to running test output. Thanks glehmann for your work on polishing this feature!
