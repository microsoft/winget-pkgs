ReleaseNotes: |-
  Added
  - Support for USDT (User-level Statically Defined Tracing) probes for observability and debugging. USDT probes allow tools like DTrace and bpftrace to trace nextest's internal operations. The initial probes cover test execution lifecycle events.
    For more information, see the USDT documentation.
  - In CI, test status lines now include a counter showing the number of tests that have been executed (#2618). Thanks bobrik for your first contribution!
  Changed
  - For leaky tests, default leak timeout increased from 100ms to 200ms.
  - MSRV for building nextest updated to Rust 1.87.
