ReleaseNotes: |-
  Added
  - Nextest now sets several new environment variables for each test execution:
    - NEXTEST_TEST_NAME: The name of the test being run.
    - NEXTEST_ATTEMPT: The current attempt number (starting from 1).
    - NEXTEST_TOTAL_ATTEMPTS: The total number of attempts that will be made.
    - NEXTEST_BINARY_ID: The binary ID of the test.
    - NEXTEST_ATTEMPT_ID: A unique identifier for this specific attempt.
    - NEXTEST_STRESS_CURRENT and NEXTEST_STRESS_TOTAL: For stress tests, the current and total iteration counts.
    These variables allow tests to be aware of their execution context, enabling conditional behavior based on retry attempts or stress test iterations.

  - With cargo nextest run --verbose, nextest now displays the command line used to run each test. Thanks dangvu0502 for your first contribution! (#2800)
  - A new glossary page documents key nextest terminology.
  Changed
