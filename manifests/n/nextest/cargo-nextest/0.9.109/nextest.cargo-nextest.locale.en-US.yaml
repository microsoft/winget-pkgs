ReleaseNotes: |-
  Added
  - A new running progress mode that shows currently running tests in addition to the progress bar. Use --show-progress=running to see both running tests and information about successful tests, or --show-progress=only for a more compact output showing only running tests, without displaying any output related to successful tests.
    Thanks glehmann for your first contribution!
  - The cargo nextest archive command now supports binary filtering via the --filterset or -E options. This allows you to reduce the size of archives by including only a subset of test binaries. Note that test binaries are not executed during archiving, so test() predicates are not supported.
    Thanks clundin55 for your first contribution!
  Fixed
  - Improvements to --show-progress=counter for better output formatting and reliability.
  Other improvements
  - USDT probes now include additional events:
    - Updated run-start and run-done events to include stress run information.
    - New stress-sub-run-start and stress-sub-run-done events for tracking individual stress run iterations.
    - Test completion events now include stdout_len and stderr_len fields for output size tracking.
