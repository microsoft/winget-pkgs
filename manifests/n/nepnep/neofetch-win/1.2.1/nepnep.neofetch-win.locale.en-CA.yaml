ShortDescription: Simple, ultra-lightweight neofetch clone for Windows 10+
Description: Simple, ultra-lightweight neofetch clone for Windows 10+ written in C++ and installable through winget(?). The executable is just under 70KB and requires no dependencies other than the MS Visual C++ redists (which should be installed already, and if they're not my installer will take care of that for you :)
