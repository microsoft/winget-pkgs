ReleaseNotes: |-
  Improved concurrency and reduced lock contention
  - Changed to more scalable locks for both the transaction pool and LRU caches, ensuring better scalability on systems with high core counts.
  - Used more scalable priority locks where block production and other tasks cross to give precedence to block production, optimizing performance in critical areas.
  - During signature recovery, it was changed to access the transactions from the pool serially to reduce lock contention on the transaction pool while maintaining parallel processing for ECDSA and Keccak calculations for faster throughput.
  New JSON-RPC methods
  - eth_getBlockReceipts that is based on the previous Parity implementation and gives an easier way to get all receipts for transactions within a specified block
  - debug_getRawBlock debug_getRawReceipts debug_getRawHeader debug_getRawTransaction These methods have been added to have a possibility to analyze encoded block/receipt/header/transaction
  - Healthier for the entire network
  - Makes the database size bigger for freshly synced nodes (about 200 GB extra space will be needed)
  - The change is made in a way that already synced nodes that are synced till the ancient barrier 11052984 will not sync anything in addition (to sync all of them, resync from scratch is required)
  - This may be revisited as part of EIP-4444

  - Return error codes in Evm rather than throwing more expensive exceptions by @benaadams in #6406
  - Reduce memory for GetPayloadBodiesByRangeV1 and GetPayloadBodiesByHashV1 by streaming the results immediately rather than building up the total response and then sending it all at once by @benaadams in #6287
  - Donâ€™t throw exceptions for missing nodes when searching for them (missing nodes) during sync by @benaadams in #6425
  - Remove duplicate calls to FindHeader in eth_getLogs by @benaadams in #6421
