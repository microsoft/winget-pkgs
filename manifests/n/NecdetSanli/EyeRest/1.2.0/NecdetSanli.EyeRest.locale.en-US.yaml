ShortDescription: Lightweight tray app that reminds you to follow the 20-20-20 rule.
Description: |
  EyeRest is a small Windows tray application that helps you follow the 20–20–20 rule for eye health by showing periodic desktop notifications.

  It runs in the Windows notification area, uses Windows 10/11 toast notifications when available (with a tray balloon fallback), and lets you configure:
  - Reminder interval (for example every 5–60 minutes)
  - Whether reminders are enabled
  - Optional left-click toggle on the tray icon
  - Optional persistent settings and "Start with Windows" for the current user

  The app is built with .NET Framework 4.8 and WinForms, is open source, and does not collect any personal data or telemetry. For full details, source code, and privacy information, see the project page.

  ## Highlights

  EyeRest 1.2.0 introduces a more flexible reminder workflow, an optional
  left-click toggle, and a small About dialog – while keeping the app lightweight
  and telemetry-free.

  ### ✨ What’s new

  - Configurable reminder interval (per session)
    - You can now adjust the reminder interval in minutes (e.g. 5, 20, 45…) instead
      of being locked to 20 minutes.
    - The default interval is still 20 minutes in Release builds (with a shorter
      interval in Debug for testing).
  - Optional left-click toggle
    - A new option lets you use left-click on the tray icon to toggle reminders on
      or off.
    - When enabled, a single left-click:
      - Flips the reminder state,
      - Updates the tray icon (normal vs. snoozed),
      - Shows a short confirmation notification.
    - When disabled, a single left-click simply opens the Options dialog for better
      discoverability.
  - About dialog
    - A new About window shows:
      - App name and version (from assembly metadata),
      - Author information,
      - A short privacy note (no telemetry, no personal data collection),
      - A direct link to the GitHub repository.
  - Toast notifications with balloon fallback
    - EyeRest now prefers Windows 10/11 toast notifications (via
      Microsoft.Toolkit.Uwp.Notifications) for reminders and state changes.
    - If toasts are not supported or fail at runtime, it falls back to classic tray
      balloon tips so you still get notified.

  ### ⚙️ Improvements & fixes

  - The tray icon now consistently uses:
    - The main EyeRest icon when reminders are enabled,
    - A dedicated snoozed icon when reminders are disabled,
      including after state changes and when using toasts with balloon fallback.
  - The reminder timer now uses a session-only ReminderIntervalMinutes value
    instead of a hard-coded 20-minute interval.
  - The Options dialog wording has been updated (e.g. “Enable reminders”) for
    clearer behavior.
  - A few internal cleanups around timer shutdown and UI marshaling improve
    reliability on exit.
