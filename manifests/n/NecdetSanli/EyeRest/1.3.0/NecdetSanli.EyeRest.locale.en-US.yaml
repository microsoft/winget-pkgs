ShortDescription: Lightweight tray app that reminds you to follow the 20-20-20 rule.
Description: |
  EyeRest is a small Windows tray application that helps you follow the 20–20–20 rule for eye health by showing periodic desktop notifications.

  It runs in the Windows notification area, uses Windows 10/11 toast notifications when available (with a tray balloon fallback), and lets you configure:
  - Reminder interval (for example every 5–60 minutes)
  - Whether reminders are enabled
  - Optional left-click toggle on the tray icon
  - Optional persistent settings and "Start with Windows" for the current user

  The app is built with .NET Framework 4.8 and WinForms, is open source, and does not collect any personal data or telemetry. For full details, source code, and privacy information, see the project page.
