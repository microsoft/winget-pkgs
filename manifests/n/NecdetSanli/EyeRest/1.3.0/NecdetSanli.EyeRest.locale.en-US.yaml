ShortDescription: Lightweight tray app that reminds you to follow the 20-20-20 rule.
Description: |
  EyeRest is a small Windows tray application that helps you follow the 20–20–20 rule for eye health by showing periodic desktop notifications.

  It runs in the Windows notification area, uses Windows 10/11 toast notifications when available (with a tray balloon fallback), and lets you configure:
  - Reminder interval (for example every 5–60 minutes)
  - Whether reminders are enabled
  - Optional left-click toggle on the tray icon
  - Optional persistent settings and "Start with Windows" for the current user

  The app is built with .NET Framework 4.8 and WinForms, is open source, and does not collect any personal data or telemetry. For full details, source code, and privacy information, see the project page.

  Highlights
  EyeRest 1.3.0 focuses on making the app more convenient to use day-to-day by
  adding optional persistence and an opt-in Start with Windows feature – while
  keeping the original “session-only” behavior as the default.
  If you don’t change anything in the Options dialog, EyeRest still works like
  previous versions: a lightweight tray app that reminds you to follow the 20–20–20 rule.
  ✨ What’s new
  ✅ Persistent settings (optional)
  You can now choose to have EyeRest remember your preferences across sessions:
  - Added a “Remember my settings for future sessions” checkbox in the Options dialog.
  - When enabled, EyeRest saves:
    - Whether reminders are enabled or disabled
    - The reminder interval (in minutes)
    - Whether left-click toggles reminders
    - Whether “Start with Windows” is enabled
  On the next launch, these values are restored and applied automatically.
  Storage strategy (portable-first):
  - EyeRest first tries to store EyeRest.ini next to the executable
    (nice for portable-style usage).
  - If the exe folder is not writable (e.g. installed under Program Files via MSI/MSIX),
    it falls back to:
    - %APPDATA%\EyeRest\EyeRest.ini
  If you prefer the old behavior, just leave “Remember my settings” unchecked and EyeRest
  will continue to work as a per-session app.
  🖥️ “Start with Windows” option
  You can now let EyeRest launch automatically when you sign in to Windows:
  - New checkbox in Options:
    - “Start EyeRest automatically with Windows”
  - When enabled:
    - EyeRest creates a per-user entry under
      HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
  - When disabled:
    - The entry is removed.
  This setting is also stored in the INI file when “Remember my settings” is enabled.
  Scope is per-user only – no admin rights or system-wide changes.
  🧩 Options dialog & behavior
  - Extended the Options dialog to include:
    - “Remember my settings for future sessions”
    - “Start EyeRest automatically with Windows”
  - The dialog still lets you:
    - Enable/disable reminders
    - Configure the reminder interval in minutes
    - Optionally use left-click on the tray icon to toggle reminders
  - On OK, EyeRest:
    - Applies changes for the current session
    - Saves settings to the INI file when persistence is enabled
    - Updates auto-start based on the “Start with Windows” option
  🔧 Under the hood
  - Added IniSettingsHelper to manage loading/saving settings from an INI file
    with a portable-first strategy and %APPDATA% fallback.
  - Added AutoStartHelper to manage the HKCU Run entry for per-user auto-start.
  - Updated EyeRestApplicationContext to:
    - Load persisted settings (if any) at startup
    - Apply reminder interval, enabled state, left-click toggle, and auto-start
      settings to the running session.
  - Bumped assembly version to 1.3.0 and aligned the MSI setup project.
  For a detailed list of changes, see the CHANGELOG.
