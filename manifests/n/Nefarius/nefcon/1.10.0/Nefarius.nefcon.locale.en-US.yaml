ShortDescription: Windows device driver installation and management tool.
Description: |-
  This little self-contained, no-dependency tool can be built either as a console application or a Windows application which has no visible window (ideal to use in combination with setup makers).
  It offers a command-line-based driver (un-)installer and allows for simple manipulation of class filter entries.
