  What's New
  - Native DeepSeek-R1-Distill Support: GPT4All now has robust support for the DeepSeek-R1 family of distillations.
      - Several model variants are now available on the downloads page.
      - Reasoning (wrapped in "think" tags) is displayed similarly to the Reasoner model.
      - The DeepSeek-R1 Qwen pretokenizer is now supported, resolving the loading failure in previous versions.
      - The model is now configured with a GPT4All-compatible prompt template by default.
  - Chat Templating Overhaul: The template parser has been completely replaced with one that has much better compatibility with common models.
  - Code Interpreter Fixes:
      - An issue preventing the code interpreter from logging a single string in v3.7.0 has been fixed.
      - The UI no longer freezes while the code interpreter is running a computation.
  - Local Server Fixes:
      - An issue preventing the server from using LocalDocs after the first request since v3.5.0 has been fixed.
      - System messages are now correctly hidden from the message history.
