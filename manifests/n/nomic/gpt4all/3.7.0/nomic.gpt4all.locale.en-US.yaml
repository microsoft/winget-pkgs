  What's New
  - Windows ARM Support: GPT4All now supports the Windows ARM platform, ensuring compatibility with devices powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon and Microsoft SQ-series processors.
      - NOTE: Support for GPU and/or NPU acceleration is not available at this time. Only the CPU will be used to run LLMs.
      - NOTE: You must install the new Windows ARM version of GPT4All from the website. The standard Windows version will not work due to emulation limitations.
  - Fixed Updating on macOS: The maintenance tool no longer crashes when attempting to update or uninstall GPT4All on Sequoia.
      - NOTE: If you have installed the version from the GitHub releases as a workaround for this issue, you can safely uninstall it and switch back to the version from the website.
  - Fixed Chat Saving on macOS: Chats now save as expected when the application is quit with Command-Q.
  - Code Interpreter Improvements:
      - The behavior when the code takes too long to execute and times out has been improved.
      - console.log now accepts multiple arguments for better compatibility with native JavaScript.
  - Chat Templating Improvements:
      - Two crashes and one compatibility issue have been fixed in the chat template parser.
      - The default chat template for EM German Mistral has been fixed.
      - Automatic replacements have been added for five new models as we continue to improve compatibility with common chat templates.
