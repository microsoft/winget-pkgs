  What's Changed
    - Add 12 new model architectures for CPU and Metal inference (#1914)
    - These are Baichuan, BLOOM, CodeShell, GPT-2, Orion, Persimmon, Phi and Phi-2, Plamo, Qwen, Qwen2, Refact, and StableLM.
    - We don't have official downloads for these yet, but TheBloke offers plenty of compatible GGUF quantizations.
    - Restore minimum window size of 720x480 (1b524c4)
    - Use ChatML for Mistral OpenOrca to make its output formatting more reliable (#1935)
  Bug Fixes
    - Fix VRAM not being freed when CPU fallback occurs - this makes switching models more reliable (#1901)
    - Disable offloading of Mixtral to GPU because we crash otherwise (#1931)
    - Limit extensions scanned by LocalDocs to txt, pdf, md, rst - other formats were inserting useless binary data (#1912)

    - Accessibility improvements (4258bb1)
  New Contributors
