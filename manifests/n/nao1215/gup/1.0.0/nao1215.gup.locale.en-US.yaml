  Gratitude
  I am upgrading nao1215/gup to version 1.0.0.
  Let me share a brief memory. I released the gup command shortly before my son was born. At the time, I had very little experience with Golang and developed the project largely through trial and error. Fortunately, an influencer introduced gup on X (it had a different name back then; it was called Twitter), and the project grew steadily from there.
  Through developing gup, I learned how to set up CI, use linters, and navigate the Go development ecosystem. I also learned how to handle bug reports after calming my crying son at night. Looking back, I feel that gup played a significant role in shaping me as a Golang developer. Although I was unfamiliar with open-source culture at the time, gup became the catalyst for many of my later open-source projects.
  I would not have made it this far without the support of many contributors. I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere gratitude, and I hope you will continue to support gup.
