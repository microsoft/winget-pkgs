ShortDescription: Desktop AI Assistant / Universal MCP Client
Description: |-
  Witsy is a BYOK (Bring Your Own Keys) AI application: it means you need to have API keys for the LLM providers you want to use. Alternatively, you can use Ollama to run models locally on your machine for free and use them in Witsy.
  It is the first of very few (only?) universal MCP clients:
  Witsy allows you to run MCP servers with virtually any LLM!
  Non-exhaustive feature list:
  - OpenAI, Ollama, Anthropic, MistralAI, Google, xAI, Azure, OpenRouter, DeepSeek, Groq and Cerebras models supported

  - Chat completion with vision models support (describe an image)
  - Text-to-image and text-to video with OpenAI, Google, xAI, Replicate, fal.ai and HuggingFace
  - Image-to-image (image editing) and image-to-video with Google, Replicate and fal.ai
  - LLM plugins to augment LLM: execute python code, search the Internet...
  - Anthropic MCP server support
  - Scratchpad to interactively create the best content with any model!
  - Prompt anywhere allows to generate content directly in any application
  - AI commands runnable on highlighted text in almost any application
  - Experts prompts to specialize your bot on a specific topic
  - Long-term memory plugin to increase relevance of LLM answers
  - Read aloud of assistant messages (requires OpenAI or ElevenLabs API key)
  - Read aloud of any text in other applications (requires OpenAI or ElevenLabs API key)

ReleaseNotes: |-
  This release introduces agents in Witsy! When Deep Research was relesed, it was built on top of an agent creation and execution framework that was not exposed through Witsy UI. This is now fixed. Head-over to the Create you own agents tutorial to learn how to create multi-step workflow agents and have agents delegate tasks to other agents!
  Added
  - Create you own agents
  - Document Repository file change monitoring (https://github.com/nbonamy/witsy/discussions/304)
  - OpenAI GPT-5 model support (vision flag, verbosity) (https://github.com/nbonamy/witsy/issues/379)
