ShortDescription: Desktop AI Assistant / Universal MCP Client
Description: |-
  Witsy is a BYOK (Bring Your Own Keys) AI application: it means you need to have API keys for the LLM providers you want to use. Alternatively, you can use Ollama to run models locally on your machine for free and use them in Witsy.
  It is the first of very few (only?) universal MCP clients:
  Witsy allows you to run MCP servers with virtually any LLM!
