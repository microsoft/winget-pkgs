ShortDescription: Desktop AI Assistant / Universal MCP Client
Description: |-
  Witsy is a BYOK (Bring Your Own Keys) AI application: it means you need to have API keys for the LLM providers you want to use. Alternatively, you can use Ollama to run models locally on your machine for free and use them in Witsy.
  It is the first of very few (only?) universal MCP clients:
  Witsy allows you to run MCP servers with virtually any LLM!
  Non-exhaustive feature list:
  - OpenAI, Ollama, Anthropic, MistralAI, Google, xAI, Azure, OpenRouter, DeepSeek, Groq and Cerebras models supported

  - Text-to-image and text-to video with OpenAI, Google, xAI, Replicate, fal.ai and HuggingFace

  - LLM plugins to augment LLM: execute python code, search the Internet...
  - Anthropic MCP server support
  - Scratchpad to interactively create the best content with any model!
  - Prompt anywhere allows to generate content directly in any application
  - AI commands runnable on highlighted text in almost any application
