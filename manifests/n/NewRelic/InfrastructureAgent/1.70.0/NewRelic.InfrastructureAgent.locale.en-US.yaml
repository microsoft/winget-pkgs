  What's Changed
  - feat(oci): add Oracle Cloud-specific tags to hosts running on OCI in https://github.com/newrelic/infrastructure-agent/pull/2121
    Starting with version 1.70.0, the new relic infrastructure agent collects the following details for VMâ€™s running inside Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI):
    displayName
    host.id
    oci.availabilityDomain
    oci.region
    oci.compartmentId
    oci.shape
    oci.imageId
    These details are available as tags for the New Relic entity search, and as attributes for queries via NRQL. Additionally, the host.id is important for the upcoming NR Cloud Integration for OCI, to make sure that any additional metadata will get attached to the correct Host entity.
    The infra agent metadata functionality is enabled by default. Customers who would like to disable this feature can use the configuration items disable_cloud_metadata or disable_cloud_instance_id.
    Background:
    For many years already, New Relic Infrastructure Agents installed on a VM running in AWS, Azure or GCP had the equivalent metadata detail collection, and this behavior is enabled by default. For consistency across different clouds, the OCI feature is using the same configuration items and the same default behavior.
