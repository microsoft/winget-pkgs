ShortDescription: A new type of shell
Description: |-
  Hello, and welcome to the Nushell project.
  The goal of this project is to take the Unix philosophy of shells, where pipes connect simple commands together, and bring it to the modern style of development.
  Nu takes cues from a lot of familiar territory, traditional shells like bash, object based shells like PowerShell, functional programming, systems programming, and more.
