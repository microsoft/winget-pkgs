ShortDescription: A new type of shell
Description: |-
  Hello, and welcome to the Nushell project.
  The goal of this project is to take the Unix philosophy of shells, where pipes connect simple commands together, and bring it to the modern style of development.
  Nu takes cues from a lot of familiar territory, traditional shells like bash, object based shells like PowerShell, functional programming, systems programming, and more.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  - The configured hooks should again properly affect the scope (e.g. virtualenv integrations using a hook to activate as an overlay) (#12383)
  - mkdir/touch did not correctly resolve relative paths after using cd. This is now fixed. (#12394)
  - The default config file created by 0.92.0 assumed that you built with the default feature set including the system-clipboard.
    This is not working on platforms like Android/Termux (termux builds with default-no-clipboard).
    Now we only create keybindings in config.nu that are supported on all platforms and provide suggestions as comments.
    You may want to recreate config.nu with 0.92.1 if you run into this issue. (#12385)
  - The timing of drop notifications sent to plugins has been corrected. (#12341)
