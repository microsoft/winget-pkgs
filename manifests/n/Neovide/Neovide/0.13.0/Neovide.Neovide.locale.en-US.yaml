  What's Changed
  The main highlights are:
  - Improved and more configurable font rendering, see neovide_text_contrast and neovide_text_gamma
  - D3D for smoother rendering on Windows
  - Fully working smooth scrolling in Windows with borders and highlights
  - Better stability compared to 0.12.x
  Breaking changes
  - Neovim 0.10.0 is now required
  - The font size in config.toml is now specified in points instead of pixels, to match the behaviour of guifont and most other software
  - The macOS option neovide_input_macos_alt_is_meta has been renamed to neovide_input_macos_option_key_is_meta and instead of true/false it can now be set to only_left, only_right, both or none
  - The font sizes are now slightly different and matches that set in most other programs due to the fractional font support.
  - The --fork option has been reversed, and --no-fork is now the default. If the old behaviour is desired, you can set the environment variable NEOVIDE_FORK=1
  - Closing the Window when using remote connections now also exits Neovim. If you want to keep the remote instance running, you can detach using :call chanclose(g:neovide_channel_id)
  Known issues
  - Neovide will hang on some Windows systems. This has turned out to be a very tricky bug to track down, since it only occurs on a few systems. See https://github.com/neovide/neovide/pull/2463 for more information. Any help debugging this is highly appreciated.
