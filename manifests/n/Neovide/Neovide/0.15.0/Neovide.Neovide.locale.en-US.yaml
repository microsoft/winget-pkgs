ReleaseNotes: |-
  What's Changed
  This release adds two major things
  1. You can now enable box drawing to be done by Neovide instead of by the fonts. This eliminates gaps between characters. The feature is still experimental, and needs to be enabled separately, see https://neovide.dev/config-file.html?highlight=box#box-drawing
  2. The default cursor animation has been changed to feel more responsive. The front of the cursor now moves to the destination immediately, while the trail is animating. Many of the cursor effects have also been fixed. Furthermore, Neovide now supports multiple effects at the same time. Finally, the defaults for some of the effects have been changed.
     To restore the feel of older Neovide versions, you can start by lowering neovide_cursor_trail_size (https://neovide.dev/configuration.html?highlight=trail#animation-trail-size) to 0.7 and then adjust that and https://neovide.dev/configuration.html?highlight=trail#animation-length to your liking.
     We are also looking for feedback on theese new settings, so don't forget to share you favourite defaults here #3077!
