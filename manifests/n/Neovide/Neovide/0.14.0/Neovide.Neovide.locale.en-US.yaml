  What's Changed
  The main highlights are:
  - Rounded floating windows;
  - Users now have the option to choose the mouse cursor icon;
  - Apple code signing and notarization to bolster security and user trust;
  - Added default support to Metal rendering for macOS users as a first class citizen having OpenGL optional still.
  The performance and smoothness took a noticeable improvement due to the seamless integration on Apples specific hardware and it's a quite impactful merge;
