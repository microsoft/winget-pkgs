  - In the window for drawing entities from Google Earth files and in the window for downloading images from online servers, the texts regarding the description of the fields regarding the selected transformation model have been corrected.
  - In the window for downloading images from online servers, an error was eliminated whereby the coordinates of the selected polyline were incorrectly retrieved.
  - An error that occurred during detachments when calculating the detachment line was eliminated. In some situations, the intersection of the detachment line with the minimum and maximum limit rectangle of the polyline was done incorrectly.
  - Some errors that occurred when detaching with obliged opening have been eliminated.
  - Made adaptation for GstarCAD 2026.
  - Compatibility with ZwCAD 2026 has been verified.
  - The setting related to the version of the exported DXF file has been added to the TopoCfg – Files Section options.
  - Compatibility with AutoCAD 2026 has been verified.

  - A program menu display error has been eliminated in ZwCAD 2025.
  - Fixed a bug with the MIpct command not retrieving point heights.
  = Made adaptation for BricsCAD V25.
  - TransLT V17 library was introduced.
