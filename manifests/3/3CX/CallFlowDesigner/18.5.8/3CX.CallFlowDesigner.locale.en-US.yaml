Description: The 3CX Call Flow Designer enables you to easily create voice applications on 3CX communications system. Voice applications are programs that interact with the user via the phone and then perform certain logic. For example, you can create a voice application that asks for a caller to input a customer number, which is then verified against a database. Based on this number the call can then be routed to a certain queue. Because the 3CX Call Flow Designer is entirely visual, little telephony or programming knowledge is required.
