Description: |-
  Converts coverage reports generated by coverlet, OpenCover, dotCover, Visual Studio, NCover, Cobertura, JaCoCo, Clover, gcov, or lcov into human readable reports in various formats.

  Note that due to the Winget package needing at least one .NET runtime for its x64 .exe-s to pass validation, the Winget package's x64 version automatically installs the .NET 10 Runtime, regardless of whether the user intends to only use the .NET 9/8/4 .exe-s. The PATH shortcut will also lead to the .NET 10 .exe by default.

  This can optionally be avoided by installing the designated x86 version with "-a x86", as the .NET 4 x86 .exe is not known to need a dependency. The PATH shortcut will however lead to the .NET 4 .exe by default.

  In either situation, functional x64 .exe-s for .NET 9 and 8 are also in the package.
