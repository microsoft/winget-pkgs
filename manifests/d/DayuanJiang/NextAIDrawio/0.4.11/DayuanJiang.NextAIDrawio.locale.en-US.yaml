  What's New in v0.4.11
  New Features
  - Server-side Multi-provider/Model Support: Administrators can configure multiple AI models server-side that are available to all users without requiring personal API keys. Supports environment variable or config file setup with a new /api/server-models endpoint (#583)

  - Enter/Ctrl+Enter Send Setting: Choose between Enter or Ctrl+Enter to send messages in chat (#550)
  - Electron Menu i18n: Electron desktop menu now automatically displays in English, Chinese, or Japanese based on system language (#596)
  Bug Fixes
  - Edit Diagram JSON Parsing: Fixed inconsistent quote escaping in edit_diagram JSON where LLM generates patterns like y="-20\" causing JSON parsing failures (#601)
  - Private URL Support for Reverse Proxy: Added ALLOW_PRIVATE_URLS env var (defaults to true) to allow localhost and private IPs for self-hosted reverse proxy setups (#600)
  - MCP Edit After Create: Fixed error "You must call get_diagram first" when calling edit_diagram immediately after create_new_diagram (#595)
  - OpenTelemetry Dependency: Added missing @opentelemetry/api dependency required by langfuse.ts (#592)
  - API Key Isolation: Fixed bug where user-provided API keys were incorrectly sent to server's custom proxy endpoints, causing "API key format incorrect" errors (#578)
  - Electron Dark Mode Favicon: Fixed broken logo in dark mode by copying public/ folder during Electron build (#545)
  - SiliconFlow Endpoint: Updated default endpoint from .com to .cn as SiliconFlow transitions to new domain with Global Traffic Manager (#543)
  - Electron macOS arm64 Build: Fixed codesign failure by properly dereferencing symlinks in build scripts (#609, #610)
  Improvements
  - Disable Empty Save: Save button is now disabled when diagram canvas is empty to prevent saving meaningless files (#591)
