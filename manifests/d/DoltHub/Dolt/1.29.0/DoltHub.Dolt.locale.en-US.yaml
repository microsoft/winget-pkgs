ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Deprecated dolt sql-client â€“ dolt sql-client has been fully deprecated and will not be accessible via the CLI anymore. sql-client previously served as a built-in MySQL client that could be used to connect to running servers.
    Now, dolt sql can serve the same function with the appropriate global arguments.
