  - 6434: Fix for adding a unique column
  - 6349: Removing old schema merge guard
  - Collation changes – we weren't properly handling merging changes to a table's default collation.
    Fixed and tested now.
  - New, non-nullable columns with no default value – new columns that are non-nullable and don't have a default value can't be auto merged since we don't know what value to safely use in the new column for any existing rows, so this now throws an error with instructions on how to fix.

  - 1914: More Full-Text fixes
  - 1913: Adjust range heap coster to ensure we don't choose it over a strong lookup join.
  - 1912: Normalized handling of ALTER TABLE statements
  - 1909: Show variables panic
  - 1908: Some Full-Text fixes
  - 1906: Fix ErrBinaryCollation in queries with []byte argument
  - 1905: When estimating the cardinality of an outer join, bound the cardinality below.
  - 1904: sql/mysql_db: Rework how we store and access table data for users, grants and replica_source_info.
  - 1880: Add "Sliding Range Join" execution plan
  - 1871: Full-Text Indexes
  - 1869: Migrate most enginetests for new name resolution
  - plans projections are subtly different in a way that should be optimized but is probably not priority
  - stored procedures need their custom resolution logic ported
  - on duplicate update expressions are buggy, going to rewrite those for new format
  - skipping one derived table alias test, where we do not have expression memoization or lateral joins to help us execute a resolved plan (related #6407)
  - many tests throw "column not found" instead of "table not found" errors. I tried to bookkeep those with Skips, but the skipped suites may accumulate other differences in the meantime.
  - I'll need to revert our prepared statement logic before the final switch
  - Various validators work a bit differently, might end up skipping some error tests to get the final switch in sooner
  - TestJSONTableScripts_Experimental -- json_table still broken
  - TestRenameColumn_Exp -- error test has different error
  - We have to hallucinate unknown table, column, and procedure names in trigger bodies on CREATE, and only fail on execution
  - Column default expressions appear to be resolved at execution time
  - Alter statements are only resolved at execution time
  - The precedence for ASOF in nested views and procedure calls is a bit hairy
  - json_array w/ and w/o distinct appears to be untested
  - ORDER BY in UNION seems pretty flaky and lightly tested, we resolve names from the left
  vitess
  - 260: Rename MultiAlterDDL to AlterTable and return it for all ALTER TABLE statements
  - 259: Bug fix for round tripping parsed cast function calls
  - 258: Adding new keywords to the non-reserved list so they don't need to be…
  - 257: Support for all temporal query forms in SQL 2011
  - 256: Support ANSI_QUOTES parsing mode
