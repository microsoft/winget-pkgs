  - 10313: When DB files can't be read off disk, fail with a clear error rather than a panic
    For reasons not fully understood yet, a hosted instance ended up with a .dolt/noms/manifest file which was not readable by the DB process. This caused a panic, which should never happen. This change provides a clear error message stating what file you're lacking permissions to.
  - 10306: Fix skipped bats test for merge with longer key on both branches
    The test was skipped since March 2023 because merge would hang. The underlying issue was fixed in April 2024 when ErrMergeWithDifferentPksFromAncestor was added to properly detect and reject merges where both branches changed the primary key from the common ancestor.
    The test also had a setup bug - the SQL call dolt_checkout('b2') only applied to the SQL session, not the shell session. Added explicit checkout after the SQL block and updated expected error message.
  - 10305: gauges measuring percentage of CPU, virtual memory, and disk used
  - 10293: Add support for -vv for dolt branch command
    This improves similarity with git branch for both -v and -vv.
    Previously -v did not include the [ahead/behind] information that git had. Now it does.
    -vv is a new flag mechanism to further include the remote name in the square brackets.
  Closed Issues
  - 10311: enums should match based on int value for foreign keys and string value for joins
  - 10235: DOLT 1.79 got Poor Performance over JOIN Operations
