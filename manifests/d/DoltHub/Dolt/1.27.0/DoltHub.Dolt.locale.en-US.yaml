ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Databases in a dolt server take their names from the name of their directory on disk.
    Previously, any hyphens (-) in such directory names were automatically replaced with underscores (_) when exposing the name of that database.
    This behavior has been changed so that hyphens in database names are preserved.
    To re-enable the older behavior, set the DOLT_DBNAME_REPLACE_HYPHENS environment variable.
  dolt
  - 6995: allow hyphen in db name to match its dir name
  - 6994: Concurrent remotes map
  - tests for the concurrent map
  - probably a conversion of backups and branches needs to be done as well
  Closed Issues
  - 6491: Stop renaming databases with hyphens
  - 6965: RepoState.
    Remotes map not safe for concurrent use
