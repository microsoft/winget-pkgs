  - 9121: Minor changes to support SET DEFAULT FK referential action
    MySQL parses the ON UPDATE/DELETE SET DEFAULT syntax, but does not actually support executing it. These minor changes allow the SET DEFAULT referential action to be used from Doltgres, but do not enable it for Dolt, to preserve MySQL compatibility.

  - 2951: update mysql version
    fixes: dolthub/go-mysql-server#2950
  - 2949: Added interpretation awareness
    This implements the necessary changes to allow for interpreted functions to properly interact with DML. This was made in response to the issues further detailed here:
    - dolthub/doltgresql#1411
  - 2948: fix json_extract panic
    fixes: #9134
  - 2947: fix coalesce with JSON types
    This PR removes the call to strings.Unquote when converting from JSON to StringType.
    Additionally, this fixes a test where we were incorrectly expecting an unquoted string from the JsonUnquote function.
    fixes: #9133
  - 2944: Add support for the SET DEFAULT foreign key referential action
    This is not supported by MySQL, but needed for Postgres support in Doltgres.
    A new analyzer validation rule continues to disallow usage of SET DEFAULT for Dolt/GMS, but Doltgres can disable that validation rule to allow processing of SET DEFAULT.
