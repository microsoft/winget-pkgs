  - 2940: Bug fix: ensure DropCheck.IfExists gets copied over to new instances
    This change doesn't affect Dolt, but is needed by Doltgres to make sure IF EXISTS logic for dropping a constraint is correctly executed.
  - 2937: Fixed problems with StrExpr
    Schema() was being called during Doltgres's Prepare implementation, and there's no reason it can't be.
  - 2936: Add support for ALTER TABLE ... DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS
    Depends on: dolthub/vitess#411
  - 2935: implement ntile
    This PR implements the NTILE() SQL function, which groups rows into evenly sized buckets.
    mysql docs: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/window-function-descriptions.html#function_ntile
    fixes: #9087
  - 2934: Unwrap inputs to find_in_set function.
    This was missed in the initial wrapped values PR because we only had tests for find_in_set where the inputs came from VARCHAR columns. This adds a test for inputs from TEXT columns.
    Fixes #9101
  - 2932: Optimize ConvertToBytes by avoiding unnecessary string <-> bytes conversions and copies.
    ConvertToBytes is a commonly called function to get the string representation of a value. However, it has some unnecessary allocations where a child function allocates a byte buffer, only for the result to be copied into the buffer provided by the parent function. In other places we needlessly round-trip between string and []byte.
    This PR improves performance by removing some of these unneeded copies. In places where ConvertToBytes calls a function that allocates a buffer (instead of using the buffer that ConvertToBytes can provide), we can optimize by using the returned value without copying it again.
    Dolt shows a 7% improvement in the types_table_scan benchmark.
    We can potentially do even better by allowing these child functions to take a buffer, removing the need for an extra allocation.
  - 2931: Corrected return type for RegexpLike
    Required for proper type conversion in doltgres

  - 411: Add AST support for DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS
  - 410: fix ntile syntax
    This PR implements the correct syntax for NTILE()
    mysql docs: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/window-function-descriptions.html#function_ntile

  - 409: add var_samp to keywords
  Closed Issues
  - 9101: Handler caught panic: interface conversion: interface {} is *val.TextStorage, not string
  - 9099: Exceptionally long table names when adding unnamed constraints results in a Django error
  - 9087: Request for NTILE function
