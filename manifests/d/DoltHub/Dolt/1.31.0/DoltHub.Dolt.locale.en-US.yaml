ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Values in JSON fields that were edited on both sides of a merge are now automatically merged, when possible, using a new JSON merging algorithm.
    The current JSON merging algorithm supports merging object keys in edited JSON docs, but other changes, such as edits to arrays, will still result in data conflicts in the merge that must be manually resolved.
    If you want to opt-out of this JSON merging behavior, you can set the @@dolt_dont_merge_json session variable.
