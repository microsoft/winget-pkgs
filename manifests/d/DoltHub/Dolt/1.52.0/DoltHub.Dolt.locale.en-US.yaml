  Backwards Incompatible Changes
  There has been a type change on the dolt_diff system table with provides more precision and alignment with the dolt_diff_{table} system table. There is a remote possibility that this could impact existing applications, and client code may require updates to remain consistent.
  Per Doltâ€™s versioning policy, this is a minor version bump because these changes may impact existing applications. Please reach out to us on GitHub or Discord if you have questions or need help with any of these changes.
