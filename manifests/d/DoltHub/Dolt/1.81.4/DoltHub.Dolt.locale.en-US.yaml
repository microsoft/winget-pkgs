  - 10392: avoid math.Pow in weibullCheck
  - 10389: go/store/nbs: journal_record.go: Do have processJournalRecords log errors when it sees an early EOF.
    Logging the error here was overly conservative.
  - 10387: /.github/workflows/bump-dependency.yaml: fix autoclosing
  go-mysql-server
  - 3407: Calculate year for timestampdiff based on date and clock time values
    fixes #10390
    Previous calculation incorrectly assumed every year has 365 days (doesn't account for leap years) and month has 30 days (doesn't account for over half the months). The offset from this wasn't noticeable with smaller time differences but became apparent with larger time differences. This still needs to be fixed for month and quarter (#10393)
  - 3406: Set table names to lower when creating table map
    fixes #10385
  Closed Issues
  - 10390: TIMESTAMPDIFF produces incorrect results for year units
