Description: |-
  Dolt is a SQL database that you can fork, clone, branch, merge, push and pull just like a git repository.
  Connect to Dolt just like any MySQL database to run queries or update the data using SQL commands.
  Use the command line interface to import CSV files, commit your changes, push them to a remote, or merge your teammate's changes.

  Merged PRs
  Minor version bump here reflects changes in background statistics management. The new statistics system tracks updates for all branches with a common backing cache that reduces memory consumption when branches have overlapping table data. See docs for the expanded interface.

  - 9034: Be more flexible for missing working sets when loading db
    Fixes: #9031
  - 9028: Test new connection configuration in vitess
    This PR is both a dependency bump and enabling the configuration args in the dependency.
  - 9021: go: gcctx,dsess: Move GCSafepointController into an independent package. Make dsess.AutoIncrementTracker background database access participate in GC lifecycle callbacks.
  - 9020: go: branch_control,sqle/dsess: Pass the *sql.Context to the GetBranch accessor. Wrap it for the branch_control.Context conversion.
  - 9016: Remove duplicate github.com/vbauerster/mpb dependency
  - 9006: Replace jpillora/backoff with cenkalti/backoff/v4
    This is a drop-in replacement.
    Both github.com/jpillora/backoff and github.com/cenkalti/backoff/v4 provide exponential backoff implementations. Since we already use github.com/cenkalti/backoff/v4 elsewhere in the codebase, this change standardizes our dependency by using a single implementation consistently.
  - 9002: Replace golang.org/x/exp/slices with stdlib slices
    The experimental functions in golang.org/x/exp/slices are now available in the standard library in Go 1.21.
    Reference: https://go.dev/doc/go1.21#slices
  - 9000: Fix spelling
  - 8991: Remove duplicate github.com/vbauerster/mpb dependency
    https://github.com/dolthub/dolt/blob/b7c0ddb4aac3702114c4e060651007d590a8be8c/go/cmd/dolt/cli/stdio.go#L28
    https://github.com/dolthub/dolt/blob/b7c0ddb4aac3702114c4e060651007d590a8be8c/go/cmd/dolt/cli/stdio_test.go#L23
    It's weird that we use the tagged v8 version in the source code but non-tagged version in the test.
  - 8815: [stats] Rewrite stat management to use single threaded event loop
    Reference statspro/doc.go for more detailed overview. Replaced stats management with a worker->scheduler->executer system. Worker does the default background job organizing, scheduler serializes background and async requests, executor calls function callbacks with a ticker delay. GC performed within a loop.
    Early perf testing seems to have little/no impact on TPC-C when the job ticker is 100-500ms.
    fixes: #8844
  go-mysql-server
  - 2907: special case for unix_timestamp
    When the provided timestamp is in string format, we preserve the scale of the original string (assuming it is valid).
    Additionally, we should round precision instead of truncating.
    #9025
  - 2902: Support ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN with an inline check constraint
    Adds support for adding a column to a table with an inline constraint declared. Previously, the inline constraint was parsing, but ignored.
    Depends on: dolthub/vitess#405
    Originally discovered as part of testing DoltHub's Postgres schema with Doltgres.
  - 2901: disable_merge_join corner case
    Disable merge join previously could only kick in if other hints were applied. We also want it to work in the absence of hints.
  vitess
  - 407: remove incorrect continue statement which skips handling connection
    Caught in PR.
  - 406: Avoid spin waits and dead connections in mysql server
    Related (partial fix): #8943
  - 405: Set ConstraintAction if an added column was specified with an inline constraint
    Currently Dolt/GMS ignore an inline check constraint definition in an ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN statement. This change detects if a constraint is present, and sets ConstraintAction so that GMS will add the constraint.
  - 403: Log a warning when max connections is hit
    Fixes: #8942
    Tested by configuring a server with 2 max conns, then connecting to it 3 times:
    lcl:~/Documents/data_dir_1/db3$ dolt sql-server --config ./config.yaml
    Starting server with Config HP="localhost:3306"|T="28800000"|R="false"|L="info"|S="/tmp/mysql.sock"
    WARN[0000] unix socket set up failed: file already in use: /tmp/mysql.sock
    INFO[0000] Server ready. Accepting connections.
    WARN[0000] secure_file_priv is set to "", which is insecure.
    WARN[0000] Any user with GRANT FILE privileges will be able to read any file which the sql-server process can read.
    WARN[0000] Please consider restarting the server with secure_file_priv set to a safe (or non-existent) directory.
    INFO[0004] NewConnection                                 DisableClientMultiStatements=false connectionID=1
    INFO[0006] NewConnection                                 DisableClientMultiStatements=false connectionID=2
    WARN[0009] max connections reached. Clients waiting. Increase server max connections
  - 401: Revert moving call to recycleReadPacket()
    Dolt binlog tests started failing, due to the change in location of calling recycleReadPacket(). This change moves those two calls back to their original location.
  Closed Issues
  - 9036: Unexpected invalid type error on boolean
  - 9037: Unexpected crash when using GROUP BY with non-column position
  - 9031: Pushing a new branch to a running dolt sql-server remote port causes ERRO[0536] working set not found error spewed to logs
  - 9025: unix_timestamp's precision should keep with parameter
  - 6724: dolt merge doesn't produce deterministic hashes
  - 8844: Panic from vector index (possibly from stats)
