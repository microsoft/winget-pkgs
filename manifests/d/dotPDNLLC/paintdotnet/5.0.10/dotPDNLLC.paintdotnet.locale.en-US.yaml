ReleaseNotes: |-
  - New: Edit -> Paste now supports base64-encoded images, which enables copying images from Microsoft Teams (thanks @null54 for the implementation!)
  - Fixed a rare bug that would cause selection tools to not work until the image was closed and reopened
  - Fixed: All mouse cursors will now honor the Windows setting for adjusting the mouse pointer size
  - Fixed a rare crash when rapidly undoing multiple actions
  - New: Plugins can now access the built-in JPEG and PNG FileTypes through two new methods on IFileTypesService
  - New: The Paint.NET Plugin API Documentation website is now live at https://paintdotnet.github.io/apidocs/
  - Fixed: All of the custom Direct2D effects now have runtime metadata (DisplayName, Author, Category, Description), which is useful for a UI that lets the user browse them (e.g. node editor)
  - New: Added convenience constructors to many Direct2D effects so that they can be used without declaring a new local variable
  - New: Added GaussianBlurMapEffect and BokehBlurMapEffect for use by GpuEffect plugins. They enable the blur radius to be controlled per-pixel through the use of a second input image (the "map")
  - New: Added a RandomNoiseEffect that GpuEffect plugins can make use of
  - Fixed various bugs with HlslBinaryFunctionEffect, HlslBinaryOperatorEffect, and HlslTernaryFunctionEffect (which can be used by GpuEffect plugins)
  - Added Distance and Dot to the list of HlslBinaryFunctions
  - Added Length and Mad (multiply-add) to the list of HlslTernaryFunctions
  - Fixed the Environment property's runtime type when accessed from an EffectConfigForm (for BitmapEffects and GpuEffects with custom UIs)
  - Fixed UIScaleFactor's methods for converting between DIPs and pixels
  - Fixed ability to work with EffectConfigForms in the Visual Studio WinForms designer
  - Updated the bundled AvifFileType to version 1.1.26 (thanks @null54!)
  - Updated the bundled DdsFileTypePlus to version 1.12.6 (thanks @null54!)
  - Updated the bundled WebPFileType to version 1.3.20. It now uses libwebp v1.3.2 which contains the fix for CVE-2023-4863/CVE-2023-5129 (thanks @null54!)
