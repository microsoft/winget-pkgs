# Agreements:
ReleaseNotes: |-
  Changes since 5.0.2:
  - New: You can now draw from the center when using the Shapes or Line/Curve tools by holding down Ctrl. You can also resize uniformly by holding Ctrl.
  - New: You can now resize uniformly ("centered") by holding down Ctrl when using the Move Selection or Move Selected Pixels tools
  - Fixed: Edit -> Copy and Copy Merged are no longer greyed out (disabled) when a selection is not active; they will copy the entire layer or image. You could always use the keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+C or Ctrl+Shift+C) to invoke these commands, but the menu items were not clickable.
  - Fixed: Right-clicking on the color wheel in the Colors window will now set the secondary color
  - Fixed some issues with the Text tool recentering the view when it shouldn't when keys like Ctrl are pressed
  - Fixed some JPEG images failing to load because of malformed IPTC metadata
  - Fixed a rare crash in the Magic Wand and Paint Bucket tools
  - Fixed an uncommon rendering glitch with the Text tool when antialiasing is disabled
  - Fixed an issue with some older plugins that were using the legacy Gaussian Blur effect with radius=0
  - Added an /ignoreCorruptPDNChunks command-line parameter to assist with certain data recovery scenarios for .PDN files
  - Updated the Direct2D initialization code in order to modernize it and enable future work that will optimize performance, memory use, and interactivity (e.g. with DirectComposition and DirectManipulation)
  - Updated the bundled DDSFileTypePlus plugin to version 1.11.4.0, which adds error diffusion dithering support for the BC1-3 formats (thanks @null54!)
