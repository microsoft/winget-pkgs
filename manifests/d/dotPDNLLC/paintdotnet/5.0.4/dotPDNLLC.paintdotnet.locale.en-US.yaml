# Agreements:
ReleaseNotes: |-
  Changes since 5.0.3:
  - Improved: Image->Resize has been updated
  - Improved: Move Selected Pixels (free transform) has been updated
  - Improved: The rendering quality of the canvas area has been greatly improved
  - Improved: Thumbnails within the app now use gamma correction, which ensures consistent luminance (brightness)
  - New: GPU effects and plugins now support gamma correction, with linear gamma being the default rendering mode for new plugins.
  - Fixed: Ctrl+G has been reinstated as the shortcut key for Image -> Rotate 90Â° Counter-Clockwise
  - Fixed a rendering glitch in Effects -> Distort -> Dents that would sometimes result in rows or columns of incorrectly colored pixels
  - Fixed: Some systems were having problems with Paint.NET not appearing in the "Open With" list in Windows File Explorer. This should now be fixed.
  - Fixed: When installing an update, the desktop shortcut is no longer recreated. This means you can delete it without it reappearing after every update. This was a bug accidentally reintroduced back in Paint.NET v4.3.
  - Increased the maximum zoom range from 1.5625% (1/64) -> 6,400% to 1% -> 10,000%
  - Improved the reliability of the wrapper classes for Windows COM libraries (Direct2D, etc.)
  - Improved the /ignoreCorruptPDNChunks command-line parameter to allow an additional type of corrupt PDN image to be partially recovered (thanks @null54!)
  - Updated the bundled DDSFileTypePlus plugin to version 1.11.8.0, which adds gamma correction for mipmap generation (thanks @null54!)
  - Updated the bundled AvifFileType plugin to version 1.1.25.0, which now uses a checkbox to enable lossless compression (thanks @null54!)
  - Updated the bundled WebPFileType plugin to version 1.3.17.0, which reduces some confusion when using lossless compression (thanks @null54!)
