ShortDescription: Secure remote access management â€” No VPN required
Description: Devolutions Gateway offers a lightweight alternative to Apache Guacamole and traditional VPNs for organizations requiring secure access to remote network segments. Meant for small deployments, the standalone version is free to install and use (commercial and personal), and offers you a simple web interface as an external launcher to connect to internally hosted services via RDP, SSH, Telnet, VNC, or ARD!
