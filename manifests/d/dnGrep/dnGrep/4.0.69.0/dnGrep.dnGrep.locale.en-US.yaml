ReleaseNotes: |-
  899 Change selection on right click: On the search results tree, the right click action has been modified to change the selection before opening the context menu, except when right clicking on an already selected item.  The shift and ctrl modifiers work the same as for left clicking to extend the existing selection.  Also added new shortcuts for opening files:
  - Double click on a file node expands the node (existing functionality)
  - Double click on a child line opens in the custom editor if configured, otherwise the associated application (existing functionality).
  - Alt+double click on either a file node or child line opens in the associated application (new).
  - Middle mouse button click on either a file node or a child line opens in the custom editor if configured and the associated application otherwise (new).
  - .NET v7.0.10
