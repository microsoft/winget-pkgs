ReleaseNotes: |-
  966 Search in DOCX footnotes.  The release adds new options for extracting text from Word (docx) documents. These
  - Extract footnotes - this option will enable extracting footnotes and endnotes.  Footnotes and endnotes are placed at the end of the document text (not by page since the text version of the document is not paginated).
    The footnote/endnote reference number or symbol may also be added inline in the document text in different formats.
    Note that including the footnote/endnote reference may affect searching across multiple words.
  - Not shown
  - Superscript - this option uses Unicode superscript characters which may not be supported in all fonts.
  - Full size character - this option will show the reference number/character as a full-size character, which may be not obvious or confusing in line with the document text.
  - Full size character with parenthesis - adding parenthesis around the reference makes them stand out more.
  - Extract comments - this option will enable extracting comments.
    The comments are also placed at the end of the document text.
    Comment reference numbers may also be added inline in the document text, but they are always numbers, starting at zero.
    The numbers may be shown in these formats:
  - Not shown
  - Subscript - this option uses Unicode subscript characters which may not be supported in all fonts.
  - Full size character with parenthesis
  - Extract headers - this option will extract the header text, once for each header format.
  - Extract footers - this o will extract the footer text, once for each footer format.
  - Extracted header and footer position - header and footer text may be extracted at the start of each document section where the header or footer changes, or all headers and footers at the end of the document.
