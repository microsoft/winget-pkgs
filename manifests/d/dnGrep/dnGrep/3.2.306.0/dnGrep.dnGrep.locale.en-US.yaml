  Roadmap
  - Important - this will impact all users!  Can dnGrep run searches faster?
    Yes, with updates to the .NET core libraries - I created issue #853 to update dnGrep to run on .NET 7 or 8.  Please take a few minutes to read, comment and give it a thumbs up or down on the first post in the issue.
  - No other new features are currently planned.
  - Made a change to preserve quoted strings for path arguments.
  - Modified scripts to load command files from the local script directory in addition to the full path to the command file.
  - Added environment variables to scripts.
    Define name=value pair variables that can be used in other script statements and passed when calling external commands.  dnGrep creates three environment variables (not case sensitive): dnGrep_logDir, dnGrep_dataDir, and dnGrep_scriptDir.
