ReleaseNotes: Been thrilled to see how much everyone's loved v1.9.x — seriously, thank you all for the support! Turns out I rushed the last release a bit and didn't test everything locally, so some things broke (my bad). This version patches up routing for /claude and /gemini, polishes some UI bits, and overall just makes things smoother. Shoutout to everyone who's been giving feedback — even if this project doesn't have many stars, you guys keeping me honest is what keeps it alive!
