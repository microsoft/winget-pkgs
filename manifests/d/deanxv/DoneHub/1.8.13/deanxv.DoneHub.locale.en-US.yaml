ReleaseNotes: I tweaked the GeminiCli channel config so you don't have to enter a ProjectId anymore. Yep, that's literally the only change in this update — it's so minor you could just skip it. But hey, if you're not even using the GeminiCli channel, maybe this is your sign to give it a try? I mean, who would say no to free Google credits? I'm sure you won't let this chance slip.
