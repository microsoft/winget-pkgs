ReleaseNotes: |-
  When you update to this version, you'll probably feel like nothing has changed from the previous one. But if you really think that — you’re totally wrong.
  This release actually optimizes some memory performance issues and high concurrency problems. We even tweaked parts of the UI and interaction design.
  But let’s be real — you don’t actually care about any of that. You only care about yourself.
