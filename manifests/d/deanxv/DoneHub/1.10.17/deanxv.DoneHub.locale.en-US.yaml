ReleaseNotes: Long time no see — and honestly not missing you much! This update is just me neurotically fixing tiny things because I can't ignore details. First, huge thanks to our new contributor @bwwq for integrating the VertexAI Express channel — you're a real one, wish you happiness every day and immortality. Also tweaked a bunch of memory issues for better performance under high concurrency. Tried fixing the Antigravity channel's 429 error… and failed hard. If any expert can help, you too shall be blessed with eternal joy and endless life. Patched some billing quirks in Claude responses and cleaned up a few log prints. That's it — see you next time, and good night.
