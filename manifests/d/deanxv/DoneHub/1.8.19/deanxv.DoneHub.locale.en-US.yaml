ReleaseNotes: "This update's a big one — and yeah, I know the version number didn't bump. Why? Because I barely tested this beast and need you all to be my guinea pigs! So what's new? Fixed some GeminiCli logic, cleaned up the logs, and dropped the bombshell: ClaudeCode reverse proxy support! Now you can proxy its API to use in other clients, share accounts with friends, or do whatever legal mischief you dream up. Not my department! Just help me test this thing before we call it official."
