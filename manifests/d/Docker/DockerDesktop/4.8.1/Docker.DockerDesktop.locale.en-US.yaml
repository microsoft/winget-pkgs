    • A columns sort order and hidden state is persisted, even after Docker Desktop restarts.

  • Improved the error message when docker pull fails because an HTTP proxy is required.
  • Added the ability to clear the search bar easily in Docker Desktop.
  • Renamed the “Containers / Apps” tab to “Containers”.
  • Fixed a silent crash in the Docker Desktop installer when C:\ProgramData\DockerDesktop is a file or a symlink.
