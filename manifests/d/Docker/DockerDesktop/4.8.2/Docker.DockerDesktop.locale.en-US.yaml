 Bug fixes and minor changes

  - Fixed an issue with manual proxy settings which caused problems when pulling images. Fixes docker/for-win#12714 and docker/for-mac#6315.
  - Fixed high CPU usage when extensions are disabled. Fixes docker/for-mac#6310.
  - Docker Desktop now redacts HTTP proxy passwords in log files and diagnostics.

 Known issues
 For Linux

  - Changing ownership rights for files in bind mounts fails. This is due to the way we have implemented file sharing between the host and VM within which the Docker Engine runs. We aim to resolve this issue in the next release.
