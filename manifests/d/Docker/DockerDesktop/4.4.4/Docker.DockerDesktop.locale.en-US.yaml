  Security
  • Fixed CVE-2022-23774 where arbitrary files could be moved on the system.

  Bug fixes and minor changes
  • Fixed logging in from WSL 2. Fixes docker/for-win#12500.

  Known issues
  • Clicking Proceed to Desktop after signing in through the browser, sometimes does not bring the Dashboard to the front.
  • After logging in, when the Dashboard receives focus, it sometimes stays in the foreground even when clicking a background window. As a workaround you need to click the Dashboard before clicking another application window.
  • The tips of the week show on top of the mandatory login dialog when an organization restriction is enabled via a registry.json file.
