ShortDescription: Docker Sandboxes lets you run AI coding agents in isolated environments on your machine.
Description: |-
  Docker Sandboxes lets you run AI coding agents in isolated environments on your machine. Sandboxes provides a secure way to give agents autonomy without compromising your system.

  AI agents need to execute commands, install packages, and test code. Running them directly on your host machine means they have full access to your files, processes, and network. Docker Sandboxes isolates agents in microVMs, each with its own Docker daemon. Agents can spin up test containers and modify their environment without affecting your host.

  You get:
  - Agent autonomy without host system risk
  - YOLO mode by default - agents work without asking permission
  - Private Docker daemon for running test containers
  - File sharing between host and sandbox
  - Network access control
