ShortDescription: A very powerful and flexible file renaming tool
Description: |-
  ReNamer is a very powerful and flexible file renaming tool, which offers all the standard renaming procedures, including prefixes, suffixes, replacements, case changes, as well as removing contents of brackets, adding number sequences, changing file extensions, etc. For advanced users there is support for Regular Expressions and a PascalScript rule, which lets users program their very own renaming rule.
  Program allows you to combine multiple renaming actions as a rule set, applying each action in a logical sequence, which can be saved, loaded, and managed within the program. In addition, it has an ability to rename folders, process regular expressions, Unicode capable, and supports variety of meta tags, such as: ID3v1, ID3v2, EXIF, OLE, AVI, MD5, CRC32, and SHA1.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Guess the fallback language code by removing sub-codes, e.g. "en_US" to "en".
  Handle "--lang=xx" command line language specification, in addition to "--lang xx".
  Case insensitive handling of "--lang=xx" and "--lang xx" command line parameters.
  Updated French translation. Thanks to Philippe MALLET.
  Updated Portuguese (Portugal) language file. Thanks to Dinis Medeiros.
  Updated Chinese Simplified language file. Thanks to Wander Max.
  High DPI support with automatic user interface scaling. Icons are not scaled yet.
  Improved the layout of the Analyze form. Less clutter, better DPI scaling.
  Respect the minimum width constraint for the last column in the rules table.
  After adding files, sort first, then preview, to avoid breaking the effect of order sensitive rules.
  Expanded the list of columns conflicting with the preview to include "State" and "New Name Length" columns.
  Added "Path Length" and "New Path Length" columns to the file table.
  Restored the ability to draw the selection rectangle with a mouse in the files table. It was disabled due to bugs in a 3rd party component.
  Updated Japanese language file. Thanks to Tilt.
  Remember and restore the last used preset by the preset name, rather than via an anonymous default preset.
  The option to remember the last used rules/preset is enabled by default.
  Added file signature for WebP image format.
  Updated Turkish language file. Thanks to Çağatay KAYA.
  Updated Simplified Chinese language file. Thanks to ZhaoLee.
  Updated German language file. Thanks to Peter Joswig.
  Refactored the implementation of guide messages shown in the rules table and the files table. This fixes an obscure visual glitch where the rules table may be missing checkboxes in High DPI setups.
  Added "Error" procedure to the Pascal Script. It abruptly terminates the script with an error message.
  Added FirstDotAtFileNameStartIsExtension variable to the settings file. This is a compatibility option for the behaviour that was changed in v7.0.0.1 Beta.
  Handle the 12-hour notation (AM/PM) when searching for dates in the Reformat Date rule.
  Meta tags: Extract email headers in a case-insensitive manner, as per RFC 2822.
  Meta tags: Handle MIME encoded words with Windows code pages as charsets.
  Meta tags: Fixed incorrect parsing of MIME encoded words in some cases.
