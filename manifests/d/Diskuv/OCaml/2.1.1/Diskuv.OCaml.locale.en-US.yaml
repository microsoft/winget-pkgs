ShortDescription: DkML, a Windows-friendly distribution of OCaml.
Description: |-
  The DkML distribution is an open-source set of software that supports
  software development in pure OCaml. DkML's strengths are its:

  ✓ full compatibility with OCaml standards like Opam, Dune and ocamlfind
  ✓ laser focus on "native" development (desktop software, mobile apps and
    embedded software) through support for the standard native compilers like
    Visual Studio and Xcode
  ✓ ease-of-use through simplified installers and simple productivity commands;
    high school students should be able to use it
  ✓ security through reproducibility, versioning and from-source builds

  There are two categories of programs installed by this DkML package:

  1. "Immediate" programs that manipulate OCaml bytecode or source code:
     * `utop`, `ocamlc`, `ocaml`, `ocamlrun`, `ocamlformat`, `ocamllsp`, `ocamllex`,
       `dkml` and `with-dkml`
  2. "Shim" programs that manipulate OCaml native code:
     * `opam`

  The shim programs have prerequisites. You should install them before you run
  the shim programs, although if you forget the programs will tell you what you
  need to install. The prerequisites are:

  * Git. If you don't have this, install Git for Windows with:
      winget install Git.Git
  * Visual Studio Enterprise/Professional/Community/Build Tools 2019 in a directory
    without spaces or parentheses. For example, "C:\Program Files (x86)\VisualStudio" won't
    work. If you don't have Visual Studio, install it with:
      winget install Microsoft.VisualStudio.2019.BuildTools --override "--wait --passive --installPath C:\VS --addProductLang En-us --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.VCTools --includeRecommended"

  The DkML package will experience problems if you have a space in your username
  (ex. C:\Users\Jane Smith).

  These alternatives may be better depending on your use case:

  * Developing in a Javascript first environment? Have a look at Esy and Reason
  * Developing operating system kernels? Have a look at Mirage OS
  * Developing Linux server software like web servers? Plain old OCaml on
    Debian, etc. works well
  * Writing compilers or proofs? Plain old OCaml works really well

  Commercial tools and support are available from Diskuv for mixed
  OCaml/C/C++/Java/Swift development; this pure OCaml winget package
  only has support for mixed OCaml/C development. Contact
  support AT diskuv.com if you need OCaml/C/C++/Java/Swift development.
