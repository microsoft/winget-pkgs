ShortDescription: The Windows-friendly distribution of OCaml.
Description: |-
  The Diskuv OCaml distribution is an open-source set of software that supports
  software development in pure OCaml. The distribution's strengths are its:

  ✓ full compatibility with OCaml standards like Opam, Dune and ocamlfind
  ✓ laser focus on "native" development (desktop software, mobile apps and
    embedded software) through support for the standard native compilers like
    Visual Studio and Xcode
  ✓ ease-of-use through simplified installers and simple productivity commands;
    high school students should be able to use it
  ✓ security through reproducibility, versioning and from-source builds

  The installation will take approximately 1.5 HOURS on a modern Windows PC.

  This version does not currently work if you have a space in your username
  (ex. C:\Users\Jane Smith).

  Installing this package will automatically install the required prerequisites
  for Windows development:
  * Visual Studio Build Tools 2019 (it will not touch any existing Visual Studio
    installation)
  * Git for Windows (if and only if your machine does not have it installed)

  These alternatives may be better depending on your use case:

  * Developing in a Javascript first environment? Have a look at Esy and Reason
  * Developing operating system kernels? Have a look at Mirage OS
  * Developing Linux server software like web servers? Plain old OCaml on
    Debian, etc. works well
  * Writing compilers or proofs? Plain old OCaml works really well
  * Wanting quick installations? Use anything but Diskuv OCaml! Diskuv OCaml
    will conduct from-source builds unless it can guarantee (and code sign) the
    binaries are reproducible. Today that means a lot of compiling.

  Commercial tools and support are available from Diskuv for mixed OCaml/C
  development; however, this pure OCaml winget package only has limited support
  for mixed OCaml/C. For example, the "ctypes" opam package has been patched
  to work with Visual Studio but is out-dated. Contact
  support AT diskuv.com if you need OCaml/C development.
