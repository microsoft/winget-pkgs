ReleaseNotes: |-
  - fix some cases of the verb not removed from the input on execution (with a risk of accidental double execution)
  - add the :filesystems (short :fs) verb and state on windows (it was already present on linux and mac).
  - improve the generation of preview pattern from a file tree pattern (i.e. going from /java$/&c/test to /test on opening a matching file in preview). With this change broot avoids filtering the preview when it shouldn't (eg when you searched /java$/|c/test) - See #1097
  - display files whose name isn't valid UTF-8 (they were previously ignored)
  - android executable is back to the official binary archive
