  dcrwallet v2.0.5
  This release includes fixes to increase the mixing reliability and improves startup syncing when operating in in SPV mode.
  All mixing users should upgrade to this release to maintain the maximum anonymity set.
  Bug fixes
  - When secrets are revealed in a mix, blame assignment is delayed until all expected messages for the current stage of the run have been received (decred/dcrd#3454).
  - A rare crash that could occur calculating mixing message jitter was fixed (decred/dcrd#3448).
  - A started but killed csppsolver child process is now detected. If this occurs, wallets will fall back to depending on other peers' published root solutions and will stop advertising root solving capabilities to other peers (decred/dcrd#3451).
  - A missing check that published roots in the mixing protocol are in the proper order was added (decred/dcrd#3453).
  - When mixed tickets are purchased using the purchasetickets JSON-RPC method, the mix change is returned to the configured change account (b22f59b3).
  - When mixing is disabled and no other voting account has been specified, voting addresses are derived from the purchasing account rather than the unset voting account (bf73f3c2).
  - The mixaccount JSON-RPC method, which was unusable since the introduction of P2P mixing, was fixed (cb88e4f0).
  - The --ticketsplitaccount option, used when converting an unmixed ticketbuyer gradually over to a mixing buyer, was not being used since the introduction of P2P mixing (e45749aa).
  - The voting account, a required argument during mixed ticketbuying, is now always used when mixing is enabled, even when UseVotingAccount in a ticket purchasing request is not set true (c1b1ac0b).
  - A hang occuring at the end of initial SPV sync has been fixed (7def7850).
  Other Improvements
  - Peers who send too few headers, which could slow down initial sync time, are disconnected (59a40408).
  - Peers who send headers before being requested are disconnected earlier in the sync process (58585aa5).
  - Peers who send headers that do not connect to the block locators are disconnected earlier in the sync process (fdd9e0b2).
  - An error determining the block to rescan from is no longer a permanent ticket autobuyer failure (8c660622).
  - Background mixing client operations are more reliably stopped when dcrd is disconnected in RPC sync mode (01f1e12e).
  - Compatibility with older VSP software has been improved (3bbc7781).
