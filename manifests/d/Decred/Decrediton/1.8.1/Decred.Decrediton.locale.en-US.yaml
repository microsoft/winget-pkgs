  Bug fixes
  - A warning is logged if a VSP fee payment could not be created due to a locked wallet (1c1bcfbd).
  - VSP fee payments started by RPC requests are no longer cancelled early after the RPC returns (07854e37).
  - The random duration interval during which ticket fee payment operations occur was fixed using the correct calculation of when a ticket goes live (c4c6c421).
  - Fee payment confirmations are no longer assumed to be valid after they receive 6 confirmations, and the VSP is contacted to ensure that it has also confirmed the payment (7c551ce6).
  - Block heights for ticket liveness and expiry are recalculated properly whenever unmined tickets are processed by the VSP client  (1319da0b).
  New features
  - The verbose getblock and getblockheader JSON-RPC results now include a powhash field with the hash calculated for the Proof-of-Work algorithm.
