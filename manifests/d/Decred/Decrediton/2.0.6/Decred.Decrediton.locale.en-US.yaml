  dcrwallet v2.0.6
  This release includes reliability fixes for mixing users and fixes to both the RPC and SPV syncers.
  All users are advised to upgrade. Additionally, users of csppsolver are advised to upgrade to the latest release (v2.4.0) of that tool.
  Bug fixes
  - The websocket JSON-RPC client library has been updated to fix several data races and properly reconnect the RPC syncer if the connection is ever lost (jrick/wsrpc#9, jrick/wsrpc#11, jrick/wsrpc#12).
  - The SPV syncer will be recreated and reperform initial sync after all peers are lost (c11c84f2).
  - To prevent spinning the CPU at 100%, the SPV syncer now adds per-peer incrementing backoffs after failed connection attempts (ba7027e8).
  Other improvements
  - When forming an initial common set of mixing peers, all attempted sessions will now be considered, rather than only considering the most recent formation attempt. This can result in peer agreement occurring sooner and with a larger set of peers (decred/dcrd#3463).
  - When wallet is in the process of being shutdown, any ongoing mixes will be completed before the client and wallet process closes (decred/dcrd#3467, b9bd675e). For csppsolver users, this feature depends on deploying with the latest csppsolver release as well.
  - The version JSON-RPC method now includes the dcrwallet version (9e3cbe03).
  - The debuglevel JSON-RPC method has been introduced, allowing the debug level of all or individual subsystems to be dynamically changed at runtime (c9d7e6a0).
