  Notes
  Thank you to all that contributed with flushing out issues and enhancements for K9s!
  I'll try to mark some of these issues as fixed. But if you don't mind grab the latest rev
  and see if we're happier with some of the fixes!
  If you've filed an issue please help me verify and close.
  Your support, kindness and awesome suggestions to make K9s better are, as ever, very much noted and appreciated!
  Also big thanks to all that have allocated their own time to help others on both slack and on this repo!!
  As you may know, K9s is not pimped out by corps with deep pockets, thus if you feel K9s is helping your Kubernetes journey,
  please consider joining our sponsorship program and/or make some noise on social! @kitesurfer

  5-O, 5-0... Spring Cleaning In Effect!
  ☠️ Careful on this upgrade! 🏴‍☠️
  We've gone thru lots of code revamp/refactor on this drop, so mileage may vary!!
  K9s Slow?
  It looks like K9s performance took a dive in the wrong direction circa v0.40.x releases.
  Took a big perf/cleanup pass to improve perf and think this release should help a lot (famous last words...)

  Now with Super Column Blow!
  By general demand, juice up custom views! In a feature we like to refer to as Super Column Blow...
  As of this drop, you can go full Chuck Norris and sprinkle some of your JQ_FU with you custom views.
  For example...
  # views.yaml
  views:
    v1/pods:
      sortColumn: NAME:asc
      columns:
      - AGE
      - NAMESPACE
      - NAME
      - IMG-VERSION:.spec.containers[0].image|split(":")|.[-1]|R # => Grab the main container image name and pull the image version
                                                                 # => out into the `IMG-VERSION` right aligned column
  > NOTE: ☢️ This is very much experimental! Not all JQ queries features are supported!
  > (See https://github.com/itchyny/gojq for the details!)
