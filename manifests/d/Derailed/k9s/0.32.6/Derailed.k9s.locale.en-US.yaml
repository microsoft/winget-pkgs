  Notes

  and see if we're happier with some of the fixes!
  If you've filed an issue please help me verify and close.

  Your support, kindness and awesome suggestions to make K9s better are, as ever, very much noted and appreciated!
  Also big thanks to all that have allocated their own time to help others on both slack and on this repo!!
