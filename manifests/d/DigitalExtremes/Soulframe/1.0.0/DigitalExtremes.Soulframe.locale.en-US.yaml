ShortDescription: |
  Soulframe is a free-to-play MMORPG video game developed and published by Digital Extremes.
Description: |-
  Washed ashore on the northern isle of Midrath,
  A new adventure begins.

  Omen beasts in Ode’n chain bellow in mourning.
  The voicing trees sag ‘long tortured streams.
  The worldflesh of Alca splits with rage.

  Who will find the Silvern Seas and awaken our Ancestors?
  Who will learn the melodies of soul unbinding,
  And break the gaunting spellsong?
  Who will hold in their heart the wanderers,
  the wild, the world?

  You will, Envoy.
