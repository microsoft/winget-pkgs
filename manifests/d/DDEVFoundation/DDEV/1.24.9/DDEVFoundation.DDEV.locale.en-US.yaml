ReleaseNotes: |-
  Installation
  See the installation instructions for details, but it's easy:
  - macOS: brew install ddev/ddev/ddev or just brew upgrade ddev.
  - Linux: Use sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install --only-upgrade ddev, see apt/yum installation
  - Windows and WSL2: Download the ddev_windows_amd64_installer.v1.24.9.exe; you can run it for install or upgrade.
  - Consider ddev delete images or ddev delete images --all after upgrading to free up disk space used by previous Docker image versions. This does no harm.
  - Consider ddev config --auto to update your projects to current configuration.
  Highlights
  - Support for PHP 8.5.0 RC 3 (note: some extensions are not yet available: apcu, imagick, memcached, redis, uploadprogress, xdebug, xhprof, xmlrpc, yaml)
  - Support for PostgreSQL 18
  - Automatic HTTP/S communication between DDEV projects - no need to manually configure external_links
  - Option to omit project names in .ddev/config.yaml by default with ddev config global --omit-project-name-by-default=true - useful when working with multiple Git worktrees
  - Auto-discovery of PLATFORM_PROJECT and PLATFORM_ENVIRONMENT from existing config for Upsun Flex and Upsun Fixed (Platform.sh) provider integrations
  Features

  - Show failed container logs on project start by running DDEV_DEBUG=true ddev start
