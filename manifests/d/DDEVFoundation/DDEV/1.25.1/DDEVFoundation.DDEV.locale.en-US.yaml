ReleaseNotes: |-
  Installation
  See the installation instructions for details, but it's easy:
  - macOS: brew install ddev/ddev/ddev or just brew upgrade ddev.
  - Linux: Use sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install ddev, see apt/yum installation
  - Windows and WSL2: Download the Windows Installer; you can run it for install or upgrade.
    ⚠️ Traditional Windows users (not WSL2): If needed, the installer will prompt you to uninstall the previous system-wide installation to avoid conflicts with the new per-user installation.
  - Consider ddev delete images or ddev delete images --all after upgrading to free up disk space used by previous Docker image versions. This does no harm.
  - Consider ddev config --auto to update your projects to current configuration.
  Highlights
  - New interactive DDEV TUI (terminal user interface). Try it out! Just type ddev.
    See the Interactive Dashboard and Terminal Compatibility documentation.
  - Users of v1.25.0 are encouraged to upgrade due to multiple fixes and stability improvements.
  Bug Fixes
  MariaDB / Database
  - Use MariaDB 10.11 client for older MariaDB servers, fixing the v1.25.0 error: "TLS/SSL error: SSL is required, but the server does not support it".
  - Automatically add --skip-ssl-verify-server-cert for MariaDB 11.x clients.
  - Fixed mixed collation errors after ddev import-db for utf8mb4_uca1400_ai_ci (MariaDB) and utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci (MySQL) introduced in v1.25.0.
  Traefik / Router
  - Fixed Traefik router healthcheck warnings for stopped projects.
  - Copy all certificates from .ddev/traefik/certs to ddev-router, not only auto-generated ones.
  - Copy Traefik-related files directly to ddev-router without intermediate containers to avoid healthcheck issues.
  - Restored support for custom Traefik project configurations removed in v1.25.0.
  - Fixed Traefik router communication between containers/projects that was partially broken in v1.25.0.
  - Clean up Traefik staging directories on poweroff to prevent downgrade issues (notably with v1.24.10).
  - Do not report Traefik warnings in ddev-router healthchecks, thanks to @jonesrussell.
  Remote Docker
  - Skip port checks for remote Docker hosts, thanks to @svicervlad.
  - Automatically bind all interfaces for remote Docker hosts.
  - Fixed broken TLS connection to remote Docker hosts introduced in v1.24.8.
  Other Fixes
  - Fixed AVIF and HEIC write support in ImageMagick 7.
  - Remove unnecessary warnings for files during ddev pull, thanks to @jonesrussell.
  - Use Composer 2.2 LTS automatically when Composer 1 (deprecated and non-working) is requested, thanks to @jonesrussell.
  - Skip port checks for remote Docker hosts, thanks to @svicervlad.
  - Automatically bind all interfaces for remote Docker hosts.
  - Show warnings/errors in ddev share that could previously be hidden.
  - Fixed non-working ddev share on traditional Windows (regression from v1.25.0).
