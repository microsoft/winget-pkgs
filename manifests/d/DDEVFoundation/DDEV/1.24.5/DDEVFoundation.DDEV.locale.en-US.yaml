ReleaseNotes: |-
  Installation
  See the installation instructions for details, but it's easy:
  - macOS: brew install ddev/ddev/ddev or just brew upgrade ddev.
  - Linux or WSL2: Use apt install ddev or apt upgrade ddev see apt/yum installation
  - Traditional Windows: Use choco upgrade -y ddev, or download the ddev_windows_installer below.
  - Consider ddev delete images or ddev delete images --all after upgrading to free up disk space used by previous docker image versions. This does no harm.
  - Consider ddev config --auto to update your projects to current configuration.
  Highlights
  - Improved (experimental) support for WSL2 "Mirrored" Networking. Fixed port waiting timeouts (thanks to @marvinhinz) and added automatic Xdebug connection configuration.
    If you're using Windows WSL2 with "Mirrored" Networking, set the experimental hostAddressLoopback=true feature.
  - Resolved "unknown" state caused by PhpStorm's use of docker-compose run for one-off containers. The DDEV Integration plugin will no longer fail in this case. Edge cases with Node remain; see JetBrains issue WEB-64513.
  - VPN or Proxy configuration with DDEV? A dedicated Special Network Configurations docs page is now available.
  - Want to learn more about DDEV? AI-generated insights available at ddev/ddev | DeepWiki.
  Features
  - Downloaded Mutagen and docker-compose binaries now pass SHA checksum verification with retry logic.
  - New environment variables: DDEV_PRIMARY_URL_PORT, DDEV_PRIMARY_URL_WITHOUT_PORT, and DDEV_SCHEME. Thanks to @AkibaAT.
  - DDEV_APPROOT variable available in the web container. Thanks to @shelane.
  - Support for prepend.Dockerfile* files for multi-stage Docker builds. Thanks to @hanoii.
  - Improved output of ddev add-on get and added warning exit code. Thanks to @hanoii.
  - WordPress --path is now added automatically to ddev wp when docroot is set. Thanks to @pfructuoso from www.nazaries.com.
  - Craft CMS settings now reside in .ddev/.env.web; .env is no longer managed by DDEV.
  - Added shell completion for the --service (-s) flag in ddev exec, ddev logs, ddev ssh, ddev debug rebuild.
  Bug Fixes
