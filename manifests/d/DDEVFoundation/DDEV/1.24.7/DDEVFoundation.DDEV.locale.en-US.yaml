ReleaseNotes: |-
  Installation
  See the installation instructions for details, but it's easy:
  - macOS: brew install ddev/ddev/ddev or just brew upgrade ddev.
  - Linux: Use apt install ddev or apt upgrade ddev see apt/yum installation
  - Windows and WSL2: Download the ddev_windows_amd64_installer.exe below; you can run it for install or upgrade.
  - Consider ddev delete images or ddev delete images --all after upgrading to free up disk space used by previous Docker image versions. This does no harm.
  - Consider ddev config --auto to update your projects to current configuration.
  Highlights
  - Windows Installer handling Traditional Windows, WSL2/Docker CE, and Docker/Rancher Desktop.
  - Support added for MariaDB 11.8 LTS, ddev config --database=mariadb:11.8
  - New ddev-hostname binary for hosts editing (with improved elevation/escalation technique) (gsudo is no longer required on Windows, and ddev.exe installation is no longer required on Windows WSL2.
  - New Linux ddev-wsl2 package is built specifically for WSL2 and includes Windows-side binaries, so separate upgrading of Windows-side binaries is not needed
  - WSL2 Mirrored Mode now has automated testing
  - New minimally supported Docker providers:
    - Docker Desktop for Linux - has had limited manual testing only; prefer the documented docker-ce installation
    - Rancher Desktop for Windows - has had limited manual testing only; currently the only open-source provider on traditional Windows
  - It's recommended to run ddev delete images after the upgrade
  Features
  - Enhanced Docker images cleanup in ddev delete images, ddev delete, ddev clean
  - Shell completion support for flags in ddev config and ddev config global
  - New DDEV_USER environment variable for use in custom .ddev/docker-compose.*.yaml files
  - ddev launch in WSL2 works without installing xdg-utils (which can be safely removed on existing installations after update)
  - Support for NO_COLOR variable, see Using NO_COLOR Inside Containers
  - Return real exit code from ddev exec and add quiet -q flag to it, thanks to @andreashager
  Bug Fixes
  - Fix ddev composer create-project to accept stdin
  - Remove unused Node.js version cache in ddev-global-cache Docker volume, thanks to @lozcalver
  - Add overrides from all .ddev/config.*.yaml files to .DdevProjectConfig (used in Go templates, see example)
  - Make --json-output / -j work as expected for debug/verbose output.
  - Fix issue where the db container couldn't restart alone when extra config was present in .ddev/mysql/*.cnf, thanks to @das-peter
  Minor Updates
  - PHP 8.3.23 and 8.4.10
  - Xdebug 3.4.4
  - docker-compose v2.38.2
  - Update debian-archive-keyring for EOL database images (mysql:5.5, mysql:5.6, postgres:9, postgres:10, postgres:11)
  - Display user defined router-compose.*.yaml and ssh-auth-compose.*.yaml during ddev start
  - Align Craft CMS quickstart with official docs, thanks to @AugustMiller
