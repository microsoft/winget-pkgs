ReleaseNotes: |-
  Installation
  See the installation instructions for details, but it's easy:
  - macOS: brew install ddev/ddev/ddev or just brew upgrade ddev.
  - Linux or WSL2: Use apt install ddev or apt upgrade ddev see apt/yum installation.
  - Traditional Windows: Use choco upgrade -y ddev, or download the ddev_windows_installer below.
  - Consider ddev delete images or ddev delete images --all after upgrading to free up disk space used by previous docker image versions. This does no harm.
  - Consider ddev config --auto to update your projects to current configuration.
  Highlights
  This is a bugfix release. There were several regressions in v1.24.5 that needed some work:
  - Increase timeout for downloading docker-compose on slower networks.
  - Fix support for TYPO3 v12 and below (adding support for TYPO3 v14 broke some nginx routing).
  - Fix Craft CMS problem with passing values from .ddev/.env.web to web container.
  Minor Updates
  - Add checks for "generic" webserver without 80/443 ports.
  - Make "generic" webserver work with busy 80/443 ports.
  - Bump docker-compose to v2.36.1.
  Otherwise, same features as in v1.24.5.
