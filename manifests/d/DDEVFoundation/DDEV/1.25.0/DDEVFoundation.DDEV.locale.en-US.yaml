ReleaseNotes: |-
  Installation
  See the installation instructions for details, but it's easy:
  - macOS: brew install ddev/ddev/ddev or just brew upgrade ddev.
  - Linux: Use sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install ddev, see apt/yum installation
  - Windows and WSL2: Download the Windows Installer; you can run it for install or upgrade. winget install --interactive ddev works too.
    ⚠️ Traditional Windows users (not WSL2): If needed, the installer will prompt you to uninstall the previous system-wide installation to avoid conflicts with the new per-user installation.
  - Consider ddev delete images or ddev delete images --all after upgrading to free up disk space used by previous Docker image versions. This does no harm.
  - Consider ddev config --auto to update your projects to current configuration.
  Highlights
  New defaults
  - Debian Trixie is now the base image for ddev-webserver and ddev-ssh-agent (replacing Debian Bookworm). See Issues to be aware of for Trixie.
    (Some projects with complex Dockerfiles or obsolete webimage_extra_packages may need to be updated.)
  - XHGui is now the default profiler (prepend mode remains available via ddev config global --xhprof-mode=prepend).
  - Node.js v24 is default in new projects (replacing Node.js v22)
  - PHP 8.4 is default in new projects (replacing PHP 8.3)
  - MariaDB 11.8 is default in new projects (replacing MariaDB 10.11)
  Additional highlights
  - Completely revised Windows installer now uses per-user installation for WSL2 or traditional Windows (no admin account required)
  - Reworked configurable ddev share command with a new cloudflared share provider, see (draft) New ddev share Provider System Brings Free Sharing Options
  - Add ddev utility xdebug-diagnose command, see (draft) Xdebug in DDEV: Understanding, Debugging, and Troubleshooting Step Debugging
  - Add ddev utility mutagen-diagnose command, see (draft) Mutagen in DDEV: Functionality, Issues, and Debugging
  - ddev pantheon pull got new DDEV_PANTHEON_SITE, DDEV_PANTHEON_ENVIRONMENT, DDEV_USE_PANTHEON_BACKUP variables, see updated Pantheon Integration
  - ddev snapshot now uses zstd instead of gzip for significantly faster exports and restores, thanks to @deviantintegral
  - Add CodeIgniter project type, thanks to @Franky5831
  - Experimental support for Podman and Docker Rootless, see Podman and Docker Rootless in DDEV
  - ddev-frankenphp is an official add-on with many improvements, see updated (draft) Using FrankenPHP with DDEV
  Features
  - New Wagtail (Python, Generic) quickstart
  - Added Drupal 12 project type (development branch). Drupal 12 has not yet been released, but it's showing up in developer builds already.
  - New --no-cache flag for ddev start and ddev restart (as an alternative to ddev utility rebuild)
  - Improved support for non-Codespaces devcontainers
  - Refactored ddev add-on subcommands with a fallback mechanism to avoid GitHub API rate limits
  - Much faster ddev add-on list and ddev add-on search
  - Shell autocompletion for ddev add-on get <TAB>
  - SELinux enviroment detection (auto SELinux label for bind mounts)
  - Support for additional SSH config files (*.conf) in .ddev/homeadditions/.ssh/config.d (global or project-level), see SSH confugation, thanks to @codebymikey
  - More portable database collations. Databases imported and exported from newer MySQL and MariaDB are less likely to have problems with proprietary collations like utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci and utf8mb4_uca1400_ai_ci as they use more traditional collations in DDEV.
  - DBeaver support for traditional Windows, thanks to @ddubau
  Traefik Router Features, Fixes, and Breaking Changes
  - Project Traefik configuration is now standardized to a single file: .ddev/traefik/config/<projectname>.yaml (all other files are ignored). See issue #8047.
  - Add any global Traefik configuration inside the $HOME/.ddev/traefik/custom-global-config/ directory
  - Removed defaultRuleSyntax: v2 and ruleSyntax: v3 from Traefik configs. Traefik v3 syntax is now used by default.
  - Traefik configuration errors now show warnings instead of failing hard
  - Improved Traefik health checks for more reliable router verification
  - Prevent unnecessary router recreation when bound ports are unchanged
  - ddev-router is no longer stopped automatically when the last project is stopped, use ddev poweroff to fully stop the router
  - Traefik monitoring port is now bound to localhost only, thanks to @JUVOJustin
  - Paused or stopped projects are excluded from Traefik configuration
  - Bypass router port checks when all ports appear busy (for example, when endpoint security software intercepts localhost traffic)
  Breaking Changes / Removals
  - Default xhprof_mode changed from "prepend" to "xhgui" but you can easily change it back
  - Removed ddev utility capabilities, use ddev_version_constraint instead in add-ons.
  - Removed NFS support, use Mutagen
  - Removed ddev service, custom services can be installed/uninstalled via ddev add-on
  - Removed ddev nvm, install the ddev-nvm add-on if needed
  - Removed obsolete or non-functional commands and command aliases:
    - ddev restore-snapshot
    - ddev auth pantheon
    - ddev config pantheon
  - Removed obsolete ddev config flags:
    - --mutagen-enabled (use --performance-mode=mutagen)
    - --upload-dir (use --upload-dirs)
    - --db-image, --db-image-default (never documented or used)
  - Removed deprecated ddev config flag aliases:
    - --http-port → --router-http-port
    - --https-port → --router-https-port
    - --mailhog-port → --mailpit-http-port
    - --mailhog-https-port → --mailpit-https-port
    - --projectname → --project-name
    - --projecttype, --apptype → --project-type
    - --sitename → --project-name
    - --image-defaults → --web-image-default
