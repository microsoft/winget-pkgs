ReleaseNotes: |-
  Installation
  See the installation instructions for details, but it's easy:
  - macOS: brew install ddev/ddev/ddev or just brew upgrade ddev.
  - Linux or WSL2: Use apt install ddev or apt upgrade ddev see apt/yum installation
  - Traditional Windows: Use choco upgrade -y ddev, or download the ddev_windows_installer below.
  - Consider ddev delete images or ddev delete images --all after upgrading to free up disk space used by previous docker image versions. This does no harm.
  - Consider ddev config --auto to update your projects to current configuration.
  Highlights:
  - Sponsored by the TYPO3 Community: Integrate XHGui into DDEV, enable it with ddev poweroff && ddev config global --xhprof-mode=xhgui, then use ddev xhgui in any of your projects.
  - DevDb VS Code extension: First class support for DDEV, thanks to @damms005
  Features:
  - Optional Docker Compose profiles: You can now start projects with specific profiles using ddev start --profiles=list,of,profiles
  - Backdrop: a new quickstart based on the official add-on, thanks to @laryn
  - New MutagenSync annotation: Custom commands that alter the host system can now use this annotation to help synchronize changes.
  Bug Fixes:
  - DDEV router now works properly behind proxies (regression from v1.24.0).
  - Show router URLs in ddev describe and ddev list when default 80/443 port is busy (regression from v1.24.3).
  - Correct status color formatting in ddev describe and ddev list.
  - Remove outdated Traefik images with ddev delete images, thanks to @rpkoller
  - Resolve misleading errors in ddev debug test when run outside the project root.
  - Fix invalid upload_dirs on traditional Windows setups.
  - Sanitize ~/.ddev/project_list.yaml to prevent panic.
  - Make the DDEV_PAGER environment variable optional to prevent it from breaking wp-cli output.
  - Prevent overwriting the generic project type when running ddev config --update.
  - Update DATABASE_URL to use charset=utf8mb4 in MySQL and MariaDB for Symfony projects, thanks to @RubenColpaert
  - Delete third-party built images on ddev delete.

  - Update all Go vendor dependencies.
