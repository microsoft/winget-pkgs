ReleaseNotes: |-
  Installation
  See the installation instructions for details, but it's easy:
  - macOS: brew install ddev/ddev/ddev or just brew upgrade ddev.
  - Linux: Use apt install ddev or apt upgrade ddev see apt/yum installation
  - Windows and WSL2: Download the ddev_windows_amd64_installer.v1.24.8.exe; you can run it for install or upgrade.
  - Consider ddev delete images or ddev delete images --all after upgrading to free up disk space used by previous Docker image versions. This does no harm.
  - Consider ddev config --auto to update your projects to current configuration.
  NEW: Docker Buildx is now required for Docker Compose
  > Error: Docker Compose is configured to build using Bake, but buildx isn't installed
  Docker Compose changed its default builder to Bake in v2.37.0.
  DDEV v1.24.7 and below used the legacy builder, but v1.24.8 has switched to the new Bake builder, which requires Docker Buildx to be installed.
  Solution: Ensure Docker Buildx is installed on your system. Most modern Docker installations include Buildx by default, but if you encounter this error, you may need to update Docker or manually install the Buildx plugin.
