ReleaseNotes: |-
  ## New features:

  - Added a new command under the File menu to restart dnSpy as administrator. This is helpful when debugging files that require elevation
  - Add .NET runtimes to the predefined assembly lists in the File -> Open List... dialog. (by @QianMoXi)
  - Added a new analyzer node that shows all subtypes of the type being analyzed using the analyzer component
  - Added an additional field in the start debugging dialog which allows the user to customize the environment variables the program is started with
  - When running dnSpy on Windows 11, all windows now have rounded corners to match other applications on that OS

  ## Improvements and bug fixes:

  - Support for static interface members has been added to the analyzer component. Usages and implementations should now be properly detected.

  - Improved XML doc lookup for members with special characters and explicit interface implementations
  - Improved text rendering performance and efficiency for controls other than the main text view

  - Updated translations
  - ILSpy Decompiler
    - Fixed a decompiler crash that occurred for nested types with invalid generic parameter definitions
    - Force the C# code labels for goto statements to always use an IL offset padded to 4 bytes
