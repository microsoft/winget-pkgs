ShortDescription: A software platform for handling a wide class of economic models.
Description: |-
  Dynare is a software platform for handling a wide class of economic models, in particular dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) and overlapping generations (OLG) models. The models solved by Dynare include those relying on the rational expectations hypothesis, wherein agents form their expectations about the future in a way consistent with the model. But Dynare is also able to handle models where expectations are formed differently: on one extreme, models where agents perfectly anticipate the future; on the other extreme, models where agents have limited rationality or imperfect knowledge of the state of the economy and, hence, form their expectations through a learning process. In terms of types of agents, models solved by Dynare can incorporate consumers, productive firms, governments, monetary authorities, investors and financial intermediaries. Some degree of heterogeneity can be achieved by including several distinct classes of agents in each of the aforementioned agent categories.
  Dynare offers a user-friendly and intuitive way of describing these models. It is able to perform simulations of the model given a calibration of the model parameters and is also able to estimate these parameters given a dataset. In practice, the user will write a text file containing the list of model variables, the dynamic equations linking these variables together, the computing tasks to be performed and the desired graphical or numerical outputs.
  A large panel of applied mathematics and computer science techniques are internally employed by Dynare: multivariate nonlinear solving and optimization, matrix factorizations, local functional approximation, Kalman filters and smoothers, MCMC techniques for Bayesian estimation, graph algorithms, optimal control, etc. References to the literature can be found here.
  Various public bodies (central banks, ministries of economy and finance, international organisations) and some private financial institutions use Dynare for performing policy analysis exercises and as a support tool for forecasting exercises. In the academic world, Dynare is used for research and teaching purposes in postgraduate macroeconomics courses.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  We are pleased to announce the release of Dynare 6.3.
  This maintenance release fixes various bugs.
  The Windows, macOS, MATLAB online and source packages are available for download at the Dynare website.
  This release is compatible with MATLAB versions ranging from 9.5 (R2018b) to 24.2 (R2024b), and with GNU Octave versions ranging from 7.1.0 to 9.4.0 (NB: the Windows package requires version 9.4.0 specifically).
  Here is a list of the problems identified in version 6.2 and that have been fixed in version 6.3:
  - OccBin with option smoother_inversion_filter would crash the MCMC estimation if the filtered_variables or filter_step_ahead options were used
  - OccBin with option smoother_inversion_filter would use the PKF if mh_replic>0
  - OccBin with option smoothed_state_uncertainty would crash Dynare if the MCMC smoother was run after the classical one
  - OccBin’s smoother would crash when encountering an internal error due to the output of the linear smoother not having been computed
  - Calling model_info with differentiate_forward_vars would crash
  - The identification command would compute the asymptotic Hessian via simulation instead of via moments as intended
  - The identification command would crash during prior sampling if the initial draw did not solve the model
  - The gsa_sample_file was broken
  - Optimization algorithm mode_compute=5 (newrat) would crash with analytic_derivation
  - The discretionary_policy command would crash if the model was purely forward-looking
  - The dsample command would crash
  - The conditional_forecast_paths block did not accept vector inputs
  - For MCMC chains with fewer than 6000 draws, the default number of sub_draws used to compute posterior moments was incorrect
  - Bi-annual dates (e.g. 2024S1 or 2024H1) were not accepted within Dynare statements
  - Plotting dseries did not correctly show dates on the x-axis
  As a reminder, the list of new features introduced in versions 6.x can be found in the release notes for 6.0.
