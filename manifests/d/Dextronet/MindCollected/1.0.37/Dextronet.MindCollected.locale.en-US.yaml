ShortDescription: Personal visual database organized by tags - new software for Windows
Description: |-
  Visually catalog and connect ideas and things from your life.

  Each object in your visual database has a picture, name, tags, rich notes, and connections to other items.

  Mind Collected can automatically search and download pictures for your objects from the Internet, or you can use your own photos.

  Mind Collected is your new super-brain
  - Remember and learn things faster and better. All you have to do is to visually catalog the things and concepts you want to learn, and connect them with other things you've already collected. Your brain will do the rest automatically - it will see it all.
  - Master any subject quickly
  - Change your thinking - by visually cataloging things and ideas, you will make them "psychoactive" and prime yourself to automatically think about them more often with no additional effort on your part.
  - Change your behavior - by visually cataloging and connecting ideas and habits, you are more likely to act accordingly. For example, entering a specific healthy food into your visual database will make you more likely to buy, order and eat it in the future.
  - Re-live your favorite memories and times of your life. Easily and quickly make a gallery of the things, activities, games, people or places you love.
  - Build your own visual collection over time. The more items your collection has, the more valuable it becomes.
