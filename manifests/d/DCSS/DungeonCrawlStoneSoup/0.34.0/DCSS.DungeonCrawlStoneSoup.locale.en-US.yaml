  Stone Soup 0.34.0 (20260205)
  Highlights
  - Players can now carry an unlimited number of consumables.
  - Big overhauls to strategic damage, adding new types and reducing mutation.
  - Dozens more new monsters have been spread throughout the Dungeon.
  - Many new egos have been added for weapons, armour, amulets, and orbs.
  - Troves, the Slime Pits, and the Halls of Zot have received major updates.
  Artefacts
  - The faerie dragon scales now has a higher average enchantment, can sometimes
    come with evokable invisibility, and is a Hexes enhancer.
  - The Mask of the Dragon loses its Will+ and Slay+3 modifiers to gain +2
    enchantment and the ability to rarely summon dragons when using invocations,
    with dragon choices scaling to one's XL.
  - The Orb of Wucad Mu is no longer twice as likely to trigger as other orbs of
    energy, but now has a chance to apply antimagic to monsters after channelling
    mp for successful spells casts.
  - The Scales of the Dragon King no longer has Will+, and instead has the new
    Command ego.
  - The Sword of the Doom Knight has been renamed to the Sword of the Dread
    Knight.
  - Randarts can now come with a Bane property, which inflicts a Bane on the
    player when equipped. Randarts with this property have higher enchantment.
  - Armour egos that are not otherwise in the regular randart property pool can
    now occasionally appear once per randart as the randart's base ego.
  - Removed unrands: the Sword of Power.
  Branches, Environment
  - The Lair of Beasts now contains more decorative vaults as well as increased
    chances to see decorative vaults each game.
  - The staircases to and from Vaults:5 now have unique tiles and descriptions.
  - The Crypt end vault's old thematic item rewards have been moved into a unique,
    guaranteed shop containing a larger quantity of the prior options at high
    prices.
  - The Slime Pits has received layout changes:
    - All staircases in the branch are now slimy and can no longer be climbed back
      up until The Royal Jelly is dead (or the player worships Jiyva).
    - Going down on a slimy staircase confers a status that greatly increases HP
      and MP regen for a short while.
    - All floors are now fully connected and up and down stairs are placed further
      apart.
    - Altars to Jiyva are guaranteed on Slime:2-4 with a 50% chance for one on
      Slime:1.
  - The Depths now more consistently contains threatening minivaults.
  - The Halls of Zot will now contain one of three types of orb monster each game,
    each wielding a different element and form of strategic damage.
    - The orb type one will encounter that game is indicated via statues placed
      by the Temple entrance in the Dungeon and the Zot entrance in the Depths.
      This can also be viewed from the Dungeon overview screen (ctrl+O) once seen.
  - The last floor of Zot contains now contains two Boundless Tesseracts, immobile
    enemy spawners with fast regeneration.
    - Tesseracts wake up the first time one kills an Orb Guardian. Once a
      tesseract wakes up, both are automatically detected, and 4 to 7 new monsters
      will appear outside of the Orb vault. Further monsters will spawn at random
      locations across the entire floor on average of once every 50 turns. These
      will always be outside of the player's sight until at least 50 monsters have
      been created this way. These spawns reward no XP, are marked as originating
      from the tesseracts, are capped to 60 on the floor at a time, and will
      continue to spawn in a limited capacity when on other floors.
    - Destroying one tesseract will destroy both, dismiss all tesseract-created
      monsters, and daze all other monsters in sight of the tesseract for ~9
      turns.
  - The Orb status from being in Zot or having picked up the Orb of Zot now also
    fuzzes the destination of scrolls of blinking by up to two spaces.
  - The depth at which the player enters the Abyss is now based upon their XL,
    regardless of whether they arrive by banishment or entering a gateway
    themselves.
    - Abyss shifts can no longer pull the player deeper than they otherwise would
      have entered it (unless they spend a while there at max XL), and the Abyss
      will no longer 'remember' the deepest depth a player previously reached.
    - Finding the rune on Abyss:4-5 takes longer on average than before.
  - Hell effects can now inflict a small amount of Doom instead of inflicting
    transient mutations.
  - Troves' prices and contents have been heavily revised:
    - Troves will no longer ask for any consumables besides scrolls of acquirement
      and will no longer ask for specific named items from shops.
    - Equipment costs are less common. Demon weapons are all interchangeable and
      heavier dragon scales are rarer.
    - The Slimy / Abyssal rune troves and Horn of Geryon troves are more common.
    - Piety troves now use a new debuff that temporarily caps one's piety at 0
      until XP is gained instead of permanently draining it, allowing them to
      function with more gods than before.
    - New trove costs include accepting pre-announced Banes and being extremely
      drained.
    - Trove contents are no longer grouped by item category, and contain a
      slightly lower amount of higher-quality items themed after spell namesakes
      or unrand items. These items are also far less likely to be useless
      according to god restrictions or species limits.
    - Potential troves to discover include The Dread Knight's Derelict Chapel,
      Eringya's Secret Bog, The First Justicar's Armoury, Leda's Sunken Stockpile,
      The Lost Hoard of Erebora, The Name-Rending Infernalists' Reservoir, The
      Octopus King's Forgotten Garden, Ozocubu's Refrigerator, Rutra's Hidden
      Sanctum, The Storm Queen's Palace Crash Site, a devouring Rift, and an
      orange crystal hatchery.
  - Dispersal traps now have a short cooldown after triggering before they can
    trigger again.
  - Harlequin's traps' chaos lace buff now stacks on top of any other attack
    brands a monster previously had.
  Character
  - Players can now accumulate Doom from enemies and other hostile effects, a
    new form of medium-term damage displayed as a percentage. Doom has no effect
    on its own and disappears with gaining experience, but at 100% causes one to
    gain a random Bane, which itself only disappears with gaining significantly
    more experience differing between Bane types. Banes include:
    - Bane of Claustrophobia, which lowers melee damage and accuracy for each
      wall the player is adjacent to.
    - Bane of the Dilettante, which reduces the player's highest weapon skill
      as well as their two highest magic / invocation / evocation skills.
    - Bane of Electrospasm, which makes suffering electric damage sometimes
      inflict the -Move status.
    - Bane of Heatstroke, which makes suffering fire damage sometimes Slow you.
    - Bane of the Hunted, which makes any creatures summoned by enemy appear
      next to the player, last longer, and be better at tracking you.
    - Bane of Lethargy, which slows the player's movement speed.
    - Bane of Mortality, which gives a chance for reapers to appear near wounded
      players when no other enemies are around.
    - Bane of Multiplicity, which gives a chance for any monster you fight to
      create fragile clones of itself.
    - Bane of Paradox, which gives a small chance for each new monster you
      encounter to learn Manifold Assault with a chance to blink after casting it.
    - Bane of Snow-blindness, which makes suffering cold damage something inflict
      Blind and Weak.
    - Bane of Stumbling, which inflicts -25 EV when moving or standing still.
    - Bane of Succour, which makes killing enemies heal other nearby enemies
      based on the slain foe's max HP.
    - Bane of Warding, which gives a small chance to give groups of monster the
      Warding buff when first seen, which grants damage immunity from non-adjacent
      sources of damage.
  - Undead species and forms lose Doom and Banes half as quickly as other species.
  - Player contamination has been heavily adjusted.
    - The exact amount one is contaminated is now indicated as a percentage in the
      sidebar. Harmful effects begin at 100% and cap at 300%.
    - Crossing the 100% threshold is more likely to result in a bad mutation than
      before (but very high amounts are less dangerous). Mutations gained this
      way no longer ignore rMut.
    - Explosions from contamination are now possible at a lower threshold, ignore
      AC, and are more damaging. Their potential damage can be seen on the %
      screen.
    - Many existing effects have been rescaled to be similarly dangerous as before
      this change.
  - New mutations:
    - Booming Voice, which makes reading scrolls in sight of enemies incredibly
      loud.
    - Efficient Metabolism, which doubles the duration of potion status effects.
    - Feed Off Suffering, which restores HP and MP after killing poisoned or
      drained foes.
    - Initially attractive, which sometimes pulls monsters close to the player
      when first seen (and then sometimes wakes them up).
    - Lucky, which gives a small chance for floor items the player encounters to
      be randarts.
    - Meek, which provides negative Slaying.
    - Potion Fungus, which sometimes spreads the beneficial effects of potions the
      player drinks to random enemies and allies in sight.
    - Protean Grace, which gives +Slay and +EV based on how mutated you are.
    - Reckless, which cuts your SH in half but gives +15% damage with two-handed
      weapons.
    - Spatial Entanglement, which gives a chance of dragging along another hostile
      monster whenever the player translocates.
    - Spiteful Blood, which may spawn hostile XL-scaling erythrospites when the
      player is injured below 50% of their max HP.
  - Other individual mutation changes:
    - Electricity Vulnerability is now in the normal mutation pool.
    - Screaming now gives a small chance to shout loudly whenever the player is
      damaged, rather than when first seeing monsters.
