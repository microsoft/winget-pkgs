  Stone Soup 0.33.0 (20250502)
  Highlights
  - New magic school + background: Forgewrights, building explosive constructs.
  - Two new species: Poltergeists and Revenants.
  - Twelve new talismans have been added, and Shapeshifters have been reworked.
  - Ghost vaults are moved into a game-long repeating portal, the Necropolis.
  - Yet more new monsters, decorations, and traps spread throughout the Dungeon.
  Artefacts
  - New unrands:
    - The Crown of Vainglory, a +3 hat that grants two extra ring slots, but also
      makes entering floors wake up nearby enemies and temporarily prohibits
      stair use.
    - The fungal fisticloak, a +3 cloak that also takes up the hat slot, provides
      another gloves slot, and grants a confusion-branded auxiliary fungus attack.
    - The Justicar's Regalia, a +5 scale mail that grants an extra amulet slot and
      gives allies summoned or created by the player the regeneration status.
    - The Skull of Zonguldrok, a talkative off-hand item that grants Reaping brand
      to one's attacks and another hat slot (on the skull).
  - The macabre finger necklace now also grants +7 HP.
  - Randart weapons can now be Reaping branded, which now creates spectres.
  - -Cast on the Sword of the Doom Knight, Maxwell's Patent Armour, and general
    randarts is replaced with *Silence, which inflicts a short-term silence on
    1% of hits on the wielder.
  - +Invis, Harm, and Rampage artefact properties can now be found on talisman
    randarts.
  - Removed unrands: the Sword of Zonguldrok.
  Branches, Environment
  - Ghost vaults have been moved into their own portal, the Necropolis.
    - Portals to the Necropolis can be found up to three times each game: once in
      D:5-15, Lair, or Orc; once in Swamp, Snake, Shoals, Spider, or Vaults; and
      once in Elf, Crypt, or Depths.
    - Each Necropolis contains three separate ghost vaults, which are still
      flavoured and tailored towards the branch a portal entrance is found in.
    - Another 10 ghost vaults have been added.
    - Pre-Lair ghost vaults have been somewhat nerfed, while rewards for many
      ghost vaults have been increased.
  - New traps, all of which activate when monsters or players step on them:
    - Archmage's traps, which drain player mp and grant monsters empowered spells.
    - Devourer's traps, which corrode players.
    - Harlequin's traps, which grant monsters chaotic attacks.
    - Tyrant's traps, which weaken players and grant monsters might.
  - New decorations:
    - Walkable: caches of baked goods, floral vases (sometimes broken), flower and
      garden patches, fountains of eyes, fur piles, infernal standards, mops and
      buckets (sometimes bloodied), mourning vases, and orcish standards.
    - Solid: enigmatic dynamos and nascence circuits.
    - Destructible: petrified flowers.
  - Walking over fountains now has a chance to produce flavour messages, varying
    based on the fountain, one's god, and the absence of hostile enemies in sight.
  - Zot traps now can inflict blindness.
  - Entering Gauntlets now reveals their layout, items, and monsters to the
    player, outside of the shape or contents of the minotaur's maze.
  - The last floor of Crypt now has a 30% chance to contain a sanguine talisman.
  - The clouds of degeneration in Alistair's Party Mansion are now alcoholic mist,
    inflicting Vertigo.
  - The orb chamber on Zot:5 no longer has a chance to be completely blocked off
    by traps, and instead will deploy several of the above newer traps.
  - Frail pillars of rime can be found in Cocytus.
  - Ziggurats have even more exponential scaling for those doing multiple
    ziggurats.
  - Sprint VII ("The Pits") has gotten major updates to balance and monster
    options, while Sprint V ("Ziggurat Sprint") has had minor updates to the same.
  Character
  - Stat drain has been removed.
    - Reaching 0 in any stat (through e.g. items or mutations) now solely makes
      the player permanently slow until their stats are raised again.
    - Undead players being malmutated now have their HP drained instead.
  - New skill: Forgecraft, used for Forgecraft spells.
    - Most species have Forgecraft apts that are the same as their Summoning
      apts, with the exceptions of Mountain Dwarves, Coglins, Yellow Draconians
      (all +2), Barachi (+1), Demonspawn, Felids, Poltergeists (all -1),
      Revenants, Minotaurs, and Tengu (all -2).
  - New background: Forgewright, which starts with a +0 hammer (a reskinned mace),
    a potion of magic, and a variety of Forgecraft spells.
  - Fighters now start with a second potion of might.
  - Shapeshifters now start with a quill talisman, three flux baubles, and a
    protean talisman, which can be used with 6 or more Shapeshifting skill to
    randomly transform it into a scarab, rimehorn, medusa, or maw talisman.
    They keep their potion of lignification and start with 1 more Fighting skill.
  - Wanderers can now start with quill talismans, inkwell talismans, flux baubles,
    protean talismans, or any protean-tier talisman.
  - Reavers now start with knowledge of Rending Blade.
  - Summoners start with knowledge of Eringya's Surprising Crocodile and Summon
    Seismosaurus Egg instead of Summon Blazeheart Golem or Lightning Spire.
  - New mutations:
    - efficient magic, making spells cost 1 less (to a minimum of 1 MP).
    - ephemeral shield, granting +7 SH briefly after spells and invocations.
    - poor constitution, inflicting Weak and then Slow on taking damage.
    - slime shroud, sometimes deflecting melee attacks and then cooling down until
      it can do so again (Jiyva only).
    - time-warped blood, hasting some of your allies when you fall below 50%
      health, and can only activate again after returning to full health.
  - Berserk players are now immune to fear.
  - Constructs the player makes with their own Forgecraft spells can be
    nonviolently deconstructed by pressing ctrl+[direction] while adjacent.
  - Fungus Form and Tree Form are both immune to sleep.
  - Paralysis, sleep, petrification, and vex status inflicted on the player all
    now share the same temporary immunity cool-down.
  - Removed mutations: deterioration.
  - Penalties to body armour AC from talismans and the Deformed Body mutation
    are now also applied to the AC bonus from training Armour skill. To
    compensate, the AC penalties of Deformed Body and blade talismans have been
    reduced, and Naga and Armataurs have their Armour aptitudes increase by 1.
  Gods
  - Ashenzari's curse of Companions now supports Forgecraft as well as its prior
    skills of Summoning and Necromancy.
  - Cheibriados worshippers are never hasted by potions of haste, and can't
    enter penance by deliberately drinking potions of haste.
  - The wraths of Cheibriados and Trog have been simplified.
  - Dithmenos's shadow mimic also works for Forgecraft spells, creating a shadow
    turret that can fire through allies.
  - Xom has received more adjustments:
    - Xom's bazaars have more variety and are less common.
    - Polymorph and draining effects are less dangerous early on.
    - New actions: hyperbuff weak ally, burn webs.
  - All three good gods that care about injuring allies now consistently don't
    care about injuring mindless non-living allies (like Forgecraft's).
  Interface and Options
  - Examining equipment and talismans now can show the changes to the player's
    spell success chances for each spell if they switched to using that item.
  - Examining spellbooks in webtiles now colours spells according to their
    usability and whether or not one has the spell in their library.
  - Examining talismans now displays their upsides, downsides, changes to one's
    defences, and skill scaling in a more compressed format with additional
    details.
  - Spell range is now indicated with numbers instead of diagrams.
  - Default target-picking behaviour for spells, abilities, and items has been
    improved: it is now more consistent at avoiding the player or their allies
    when aiming harmful area effects and choose more sensible default aims for
    some utility effects.
  - Ranged autofight should no longer sometimes cast spells at invalid targets
    (such as Dispel Undead against living monsters in melee).
  - Casting ally-creating spells when there is no nearby room is now automatically
    cancelled, rather than wasting a turn and one's MP.
  - Equipping an item that would require unequipping multiple other items (such
    as with going from a 1-handed weapon + shield to a 2-hander) no longer needs
    manual unequipping to work.
  - Players can no longer wield non-weapon items.
  - Equipment slots a player species doesn't have access to no longer show up on
    the '%' screen.
  - The autopickup menu no longer groups together rings and amulets.
  - The screen is now tinted blue during paralysis and grey during petrification.
  - Examining monsters shows if they can open doors.
  - Confusion on monsters no longer shares an icon with monsters being distracted.
  - Non-monster UI now darkens quote text and can rarely contain flavour text
    instead of just quotes.
  Items
  - New weapon: partisans, uncommon one-handed polearms with higher base damage
    than demon tridents and the longest swing delay of any one-handed weapon.
  - Talisman skill thresholds have been reworked, with older talismans adjusted
    upwards in baseline stats for higher thresholds. The new tier summary is now:
  - Tier 1 talismans (old beast talisman): 0 skill minimum, 7 skill maximum
  - Tier 2 talismans (old flux talisman): 8 skill minimum, 14 skill maximum
  - Tier 3 talismans (blade talisman): 12 skill minimum, 20 skill maximum
  - Tier 4 talismans (granite talisman): 17 skill minimum, 25 skill maximum
  - Tier 5 talismans (storm talisman): 23 skill minimum, 27 skill maximum
  - New talismans:
  - Tier 1:
  - quill talismans, providing Quill Form. This melds all auxiliary equipment,
    but grants retaliatory quills damaging those who attack the player in melee.
  - inkwell talismans, providing Walking Scroll Form. This melds all equipment,
    increases all magic school skills scaling to one's Shapeshifting, grants
