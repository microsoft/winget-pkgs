  Stone Soup 0.32.0 (20240829)
  Highlights
  - Beogh, Dithmenos, Yredelemnul, and Makhleb have been substantially revamped.
  - Since everybody can become orcs, reworked Mountain Dwarves replace Hill Orcs.
  - New species: Coglins, dual-wielding gizmo-inventing goblins in exosuits.
  - More new spells, aimed at new school combinations and higher levels.
  - Many more new and revamped monsters and decorations throughout the Dungeon.
  Artefacts
  - New and returning unrands:
    - Returning: Brilliance, an eveningstar of foul flame, which inflicts
      reduced damage to unholy foes and extra damage to holy foes.
    - Returning: Sword of the Doom Knight, which loses pain brand to instead
      make its targets lose 10% of their maximum health on hit.
    - New: Charlatan's Orb, an orb which boosts your other skills by 20% of your
      base Evocations but has the translocations and stealth downside of the real
      Orb of Zot.
    - New: Gloves of the Gadgeteer, fragile gloves that boost evoker recharge
      rate, wand damage, and give a chance to save wand charges on use.
  - The Cloak of the Thief is now +0, but gives noise suppression instead of
    random bursts of fog and no longer gives negative slaying.
  - Randart MP bonuses and maluses now range from 4 to 12, instead of always
    being fixed at 9.
  Branches, Environment
  - Crypt now contains more item rewards throughout its levels.
  - Troves no longer ask Draconians to offer dragon scales.
  - Ziggurats now scale up their enemy choices and counts up much faster
    if one dares to dive through multiple ziggurats on the same character.
  - All bazaar portals are timed now.
  - Quite a few new decorative features have been added to many a vault:
    - Several new types of decorative statue: silver statues,
      scintillating statues, mystic cages, and magic conduits.
    - A new decorative wall type: bedevilled crystal.
    - Completely-decorative caches of fruits and meat, which may occasionally
      be snacked upon when walked over.
    - Piles of debris, stony wreckage that crumbles away on a delay after
      being hit.
    - Sacred lotuses, extremely resilient but entirely harmless plants.
  - Miasma clouds deal more damage to monsters and slow them for longer.
  - Rain no longer can create deep water.
  - Skeletons no longer decay.
  Character
  - Only players without weapons can punch with their offhand.
  - Player constriction no longer deals ramping-up damage.
  - Removed mutations: noise dampening.
  - Undead and demonic players can wield weapons of holy wrath, but the brand is
    disabled for them. The same applies to good god-worshipping players who wield
    weapons of foul flame.
  - The player can now be Blinded, which gives them a flat chance to miss with
    any dodgeable effect that increases with their distance from the target they
    are aiming at.
    - Wands of Light now Blind the player instead of inflicting Confusion.
  - The Frozen status now lasts a bit longer, inflicts a heavier movement penalty,
    and no longer prevents the player from being hit with Flash Freeze.
  - Background changes:
    - Necromancers now start with Soul Splinter instead of Necrotise, as well as
      a dagger and knowledge of Grave Claw.
    - Hedge Wizards now know Grave Claw instead of Cigotuvi's Dreadful Rot and
      start with additional Conjurations and Necromancy skill.
    - Wanderers can now start with talismans and Shapeshifting skill, and those
      that start with throwing items will usually start with more of them. Logic
      for giving suitable skill levels and items has been improved in multiple
      cases.
  Gods
  - Beogh has been completely overhauled, becoming the god of collective
    pariahs and outcasts. All species may elect to worship Beogh and become orcs
    when at low HP in front of orc priests. Most abilities are also changed:
    - Orc apostles, scaling throughout the game, will challenge the player with
      their own followers, unalterable artefact equipment, and potent mystic
      might. Forfeiting their challenge by leaving the floor inflicts penance,
      which only dismisses worshippers' followers and disables their invocations.
    - Shortly after defeating apostles, worshippers can recruit up to three
      apostles to follow them at a time. Beogh now will automatically revive those
      apostles if they die, but only after the player gains sufficient piety.
    - Other encountered orcs are pacified instead of recruited.
    - Beogh gains a new 5* ability, Blood for Blood. This can only be invoked
      on top of an orc apostle's corpse, and summons a large amount of orcs both
      immediately around the player and around the edges of the screen over time.
  - Dithmenos has been completely overhauled, becoming the god of actors,
    thieves, and everyone else who works in the shadows. They no longer count as
    evil, and have replaced nearly all of their active and passive abilities.
    - 1*: Passive noise dampening, halving all noise made around the player.
    - 2*: A passive shadow mimic, which now casts differing spells based on the
      spell schools of spells cast to now cover all spell types, deals more
      damage with weapons scaling to XL, and also lingers around afterwards.
    - 3*: Shadowslip, which instantly swaps worshippers' places with a lingering
      shadow and misleads foes into targeting the shadow for a while instead.
    - 4*: Aphotic Marionette, which forces an enemy with spells to instantly cast
      random conjurations at other enemies or give buffs & summons to the
      player.
    - 5*: Primordial Nightfall, which reduces one's line of sight to zero, with
      line of sight gradually coming back over the duration.
  - Yredelemnul has been significantly overhauled.
    - Yred now uses a somewhat conventional piety system again, though followers
      have to obey the rules of raising the black torch.
    - Followers of Yred get an umbral aura around them that grows as they gain
      piety, and zombies are passively animated only in the umbra aura.
    - Yredelemnul grants the following active abilities:
      - 0*: Raise the Black Torch, which enables piety gain, but which can only
        be used once per floor and only lasts until the player leaves the
        floor. Starting at 1*, this ability also summons scaling undead
        allies.
      - 2*: Hurl Torchlight, which mights undead while damaging most others.
      - 4*: Bind Soul, which now temporarily flays the player until the
        binding is successful and heavily scales the soul's HP with invo.
      - 5*: Fathomless Shackles, which binds a large area centered on the
        player and damages over time while vampirically draining foes.
      - Removed abilities: Dark Bargain, Drain Life.
  - Makhleb has been significantly revamped.
    - Minor and Major Destruction have been merged into a single ability: Unleash
      Destruction. Earned at 2*, it costs more HP than Major Destruction, but no
      piety.
    - At 4* the player will receive one of 4 random upgrades to their Unleash
      Destruction ability. These upgrades, themed after each of the 4 Hells, grant
      additional effects and elements to your Destruction as well as allow it to
      pierce enemies.
    - Lesser and Greater Servant have been merged into a single ability: Infernal
      Servant. Earned at 3*, this costs an amount of piety between Lesser and
      Greater Servant. Many more types of demons can be summoned by this ability
      and the quality of demon increases with Invocations skill. It is no longer
      possible to reduce the chance of a hostile demon, but the player will always
      receive a friendly one at the same time.
    - At 6*, the player is offered a one-time choice between 3 different Infernal
      Marks which they may brand themselves with. These Marks grant powerful
      effects so long as the player continues to worship Makhleb:
      - Mark of Haemoclasm: Gives all slain enemies a chance to explode in a
        shower of gore upon death. This explosion may cause a chain reaction if it
        kills something.
      - Mark of the Legion: Replaces Infernal Servant with Infernal Legion, which
        summons a swarm of lower-level demons over time. You may fire Unleash
        Destruction freely through these allies.
      - Mark of Carnage: Infernal Servants appear next to enemies instead of the
        player and arrive in a large explosion of Destruction.
      - Mark of Annihilation: Replaces Infernal Servant with Globe of
        Annihilation, which fires a slow-moving homing projectile that explodes
        in a massive blast of hellish Destruction.
      - Mark of the Tyrant: Infernal Servants last much longer and killing enemies
        will buff them with Haste, Might, Regeneration, or Brilliance. At high
        Invocations skill, it becomes possible to summon even Hell Sentinels.
      - Mark of the Celebrant: Unleash a flurry of blood arrows at nearby enemies
        whenever the player falls below 50% of their max HP, but does not recharge
        until they are fully healed once more.
      - Mark of Execution: Upon killing an enemy in melee, there is a chance to
        temporarily take on the appearance of an Executioner, gaining a strong
        auxiliary blade attack and rampage. This effect lasts indefinitely, so
        long as the player continues attacking.
      - Mark of Atrocity: Both the damage and HP cost of Unleash Destruction now
        increases with the number of times in a row it is used. Upon the 4th use
        in a row, a huge barrage of empowered Destruction will be fired at many
        enemies in sight.
      - Mark of the Fanatic: Gives the player the Vessel of Slaughter ability,
        temporarily transforming them into a demonic avatar of Makhleb and greatly
        increasing their power and durability. But when the form ends, they will
        be forced to fight their way out of the Crucible of Flesh as a cost!
  - Xom has received significant adjustments and many new effects.
    - Summoned monsters (both friendly and hostile) now scale with the player's
      XL, resulting in fewer unfair encounters at low XL and fewer harmless ones
