ReleaseNotes: |-
  This release is a canary release intended to be used for testing.
  Major changes in this version
  - Updated backends
    The major change in this version is the addition of timeouts to every backend.
    This has the potential to affect each backend individually.
  - Improved validation
    Further increased the checks made to validate that the database is consistent, and added new features to the repair operation to assist in recovering.
    Certain problems are now checked before and after a backup, in an attempt to better close in on the conditions that create these situations.
  - Updates to ngclient
    Updates to reconnect logic and locale support.
