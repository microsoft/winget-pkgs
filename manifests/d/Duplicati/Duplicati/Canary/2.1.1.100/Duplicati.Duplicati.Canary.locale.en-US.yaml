ReleaseNotes: |-
  This release is a canary release intended to be used for testing.
  Changes in this versions
  This build adresses an issue with timeouts on B2 uploads, along with a number of minor fixes.
  There is a breaking change in that Duplicati will now consider an empty source folder as an error, unless you specify --allow-empty-source. This is done to avoid common mistakes where a folder was supposed to be mounted but was not.
  The Docker images have been overhauled and now supports running with a custom UID/GID combination.
  The login flow has been secured slightly and now features an extra nonce value that is required on requests. If you have custom code authenticating with Duplicati this is a breaking change.
  Finally, there is now also an option to log internal HTTP requests to the log for tracing and debugging.
