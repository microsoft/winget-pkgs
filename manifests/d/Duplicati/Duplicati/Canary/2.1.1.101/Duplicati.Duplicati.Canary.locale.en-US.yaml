ReleaseNotes: |-
  This release is a canary release intended to be used for testing.
  Changes in this versions
  This version has an update to the restore process that reduces the amount of temporary space used during restores.
  With the option --restore-volume-cache-hint it is now possible to choose how much size to use, and the dafult is 4GiB.
  A problem with ngclient saving sizes with the default multiplier was fixed, and an improved list of destinations was added.
  The breaking change in 2.1.1.100 with the --allow-empty-source was tested and found to have too many negative issues, so it was inverted to be --prevent-empty-source such that it is possible to turn it on, but it does not by default fail if the source folder is empty.
  For Debian packages, the libICU package is now a recommended dependency and will not prevent installing the package.
  A pre-install script warns if no libICU package was found, and shows how to run without libICU present.
  Detailed list of changes:
  - Fixed an issue with null values on Sharepoint mounted folders
  - Improve support for libICU on Debian
  - Fixed a case where testing would fail on a missing hash value
  - Added support for limiting the usage of local temporary disk space during restore
  - Inverted --allow-empty-source to --prevent-empty-source (opt-in)
  - Fixed an issue with S3 backend reading stream twice
  - Lowercase S3 AWS Client content hash for better compatibility with other providers
  ngclient changes:
  - Improved searching for destinations
  - Resolved some issues with colors not being applied
  - Fixed an issue with non-default size multiplier causing invalid values to be saved
  - Streamlined suffixes for sizes to be the same
  - Removed support for picking bytes as the multiplier
  - Fixed issue with livelog page requesting invalid data when disabled
