ReleaseNotes: |-
  This release is a canary release intended to be used for testing.
  This canary release is intended to be the base for the next beta/stable release.
  Changes in this version
  Database schema updates
  This version updates the Server database schema to version 11 (was 9 in 2.2.0.104).
  These changes add the new remote destination repository table, and a table for tracking multiple backup destinations.
  Updates are applied automatically, and if you need to downgrade, the database tool can perform downgrades.
  Downgrades will wipe the new backup destinations and the backup destination repository, but otherwise does not cause data loss.
  Multiple backup destinations
  This version adds support for configuring multiple destinations for a single backup job.
  This allows you to backup to multiple locations simultaneously, such as a local drive and a cloud storage provider.
  With multiple destinations, you can now configure a complete 3-2-1 backup strategy in a single job.
  After each completed backup, Duplicati will ensure that data is available on all destinations.
  A 3-2-1 backup strategy is where you have 3 copies of your data, 2 of which are on different media, and 1 of which is offsite/immutable.
  Windows folder status indicator
  Thanks to @AndyBodnar, this version adds a Windows shell extension that shows the backup status of folders with icon overlays.
  The feature is disabled by default but can be enabled with the option --enable-folder-status-service on either Server or TrayIcon.
  Once the feature is enabled, you can run the RegisterFolderStatusExtension.ps1 script to register the extension, and you can then see the backup status of folders in Windows Explorer.
  Google Workspace backup
  This version adds support for backing up Google Workspace, including Gmail, Google Drive, Contacts, Calendar, and Chat.
  Like the Office 365 backup feature, this is a proprietary module (source available) that requires a license to use in production.
  Without a license, testing is possible with up to 5 users.
  If you prefer a clean OSI-approved installation, you can prevent proprietary modules from loading by setting the environment variable DUPLICATI_DISABLE_PROPRIETARY_MODULES=1 or simply delete the files named Duplicati.Proprietary.* from your installation.
  Full disk backup
  This version adds simple support for backup and restore of entire disks, including the MBR/GPT partition table.
  In this initial version, only Windows is supported, the backup is accessing the disk directly (no VSS).
  We are working on adding support for Linux and macOS, as well as VSS support for Windows.
  Like the Office 365 / Google Workspace backup features, this is a proprietary module (source available).
  Full disk backup requires administrative privileges to access the disk directly.
  Full disk restore requires administrative privileges and requires that the disk is unmounted and not write-protected.
