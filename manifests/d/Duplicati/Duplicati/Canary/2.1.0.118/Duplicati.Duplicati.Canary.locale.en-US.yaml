ReleaseNotes: |-
  This release is a canary release intended to be used for testing.
  Major changes in this version
  This version has a number of minor fixes and a major rewrite of the the "repair" command.
  The logic for the "repair" command is that it should be possible to recover loss of .dblock files, if the data is still present locally.
  This logic has been fixed in multiple ways and now also supports recovering data, even if no individual .dblock volumes can be fully recovered.
  In this case, the repair will recreate as much data as possible in new .dblock files, and configure it so as many files as possible are available.
  The purge-broken-files can be used after repair has failed to recover eveything, and will only purge the files that were lost.
  The purge-broken-files command has also been updated to support using incorrect metadata, such that files are not purged if they are only missing metadata.
  There are again numerous fixes to ngclient, including some faster browsing of restore contents, and better remote validation of folder contents.
  The UI now supports a number of different languages.
  Database version upgrade to v16
  The local database is again upgraded with two index changes for correctness and performance.
  The bundled Duplicati.CommandLine.DatabaseTool.exe / duplicati-database-tool can downgrade databases.
  Since the change is only index addition, there is no data loss on downgrades.
