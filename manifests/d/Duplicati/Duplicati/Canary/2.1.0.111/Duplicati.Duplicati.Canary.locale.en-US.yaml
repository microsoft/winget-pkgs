ReleaseNotes: |-
  This release is a canary release intended to be used for testing.
  Major changes in this version
  - Restore improvements
    This version has a few tweaks to the new restore flow that makes it more robust.
  - Improved validation
    To safeguard against internal errors, there is now a more strict validation before performing cleanup.
    The new logic checks if the previous operation failed and will only automatically repair the remote if this is the case.
    The repair command bypasses this check and can repair the remote regardless.
  If the previous run was fully completed, any leftover remote files are now treated as an error.
  Additionally, operations that does not change remote state (list, test, restore, etc) will not repair the remote state, but just verify that it is working for the requested operation.
  - Updates to ngclient
    Multiple updates to ngclient: improved auth flow, searchable menus, Windows filesystem support, restore from configuration, and more.
