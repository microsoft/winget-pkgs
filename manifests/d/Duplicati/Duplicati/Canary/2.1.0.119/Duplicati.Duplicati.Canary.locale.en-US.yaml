ReleaseNotes: |-
  This release is a canary release intended to be used for testing.
  The intention is to tap this release as an experimental release if no significant issues are uncovered.
  Major changes in this version
  Index file corruption fixed
  This update fixes a long-standing issue with index files being incomplete over time.
  The effect of this is that the recreate database step takes much longer than expected.
  With this update the index files no longer loose information during the compact step.
  To remedy existing data, the test method can now be run and only check index files (--full-remote-verification=indexesonly).
  By default, any defective index files that are found will be replaced with correct versions, so simply running the test command with a large sample size will fix the backup.
  Suppress warnings
  A new option is added that can change warning messages to information messages, so the warnings no longer generate notifications.
  The file access errors are now better grouped so it shows if the error is a permission error, a locked file error and others.
  With the suppress feature it is possible to suppress one or more categories of these warnings.
  Better backend Test
  The test feature has been updated to now check for write permissions, instead of just listing the remote folder.
  For ngclient, the Test check now uses this extended check to inform the user if there are files in the destination folder.
  This shows a warning if creating a new backup pointing to a folder with existing data, and a warning if attempting to restore from a folder with no files.
  If the write part fails for a test during the restore flow, this is not treated as an error in ngclient.
  Auto VSS on Windows
  If the user has Administrator privileges (SeBackupPrivilege) VSS is now set to Auto by default.
  Updated backends
  Updated the backends: Jottacloud, Google Drive, Google Cloud Storage, Dropbox, and OpenStack.
  Removed the Sia backend as the current implementation is not compatible with the pending hard-fork.
  No throttle for the file backend
  The file backend is now excempt (by default) from throttle settings via --throttle-disabled-backends.
  Individual backups can set --throttle-disable to opt-out of throttling.
  Disabling reported options on Webserver
  The ngclient is using the reported options to figure out what features can be enabled.
  This can now be configured with --webservice-disable-api-extensions so websocket usage can be disabled, among others.
  ngclient updates
  A number of fixes and additions are made to ngclient, including a new grid-view for users with many backups.
  Database version upgrade to v17
  The local database is again upgraded with an index changes performance.
  The bundled Duplicati.CommandLine.DatabaseTool.exe / duplicati-database-tool can downgrade databases.
  Since the change is only index addition, there is no data loss on downgrades.
