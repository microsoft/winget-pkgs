ReleaseNotes: |-
  This release is a canary release intended to be used for testing.
  The intention is to tap this release as an experimental release if no significant issues are uncovered.
  Major changes in this version
  This release is mostly fixing minor issues reported from 2.1.0.119, with only a few changes that could impact backups.
  A significant amount of fixes has been completed for ngclient.
  The repair flow can now detect and fix cases where a file or folder has been assigned no metadata.
  Since the codebase does not support this, the current fix is to assign an empty metadata block if possible, and otherwise use the smallest metadata block.
  The Test output no longer reports failures on index files that were fixed during the test process.
  The destination picker UI in ngclient has been reworked in multiple ways, providing a more robust experience with the Test button and results being more prominent.
  The restore flow and file picker has been updated to fix a number of issues with files and folders that have the same prefix.
  Some issues with the picker not having the correct visual representation of the state.
