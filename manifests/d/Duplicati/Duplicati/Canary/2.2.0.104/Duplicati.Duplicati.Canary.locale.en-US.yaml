ReleaseNotes: |-
  This release is a canary release intended to be used for testing.
  Changes in this versions
  Locking and protection
  This version extends on the remote file locking feature added in 2.2.0.103, to now also include locking support for Google Cloud Storage (GCS), as well as a policy mode option for Azure Blob Storage.
  This version also adds a new option --soft-delete-prefix which enables the soft-delete feature.
  When soft-delete is enabled, files are renamed (or moved) to a new location instead of being deleted.
  For destinations that support lifecycle management, this can be used to setup access such that Duplicati cannot delete a file, but can rename/move it.
  When Duplicati wants to delete a file, it will instead rename/move the file to a new location, and the lifecycle management or other tool can be used to delete the files with a specific prefix after a certain period of time.
  Remote sources
  Remote sources have been supported, even in the current stable release, but the usage required some difficult manual string construction.
  This version adds support for remote sources in the UI, and makes it easier to use remote sources, with a prominent button on the source page.
  Besides making remote sources easier to use, this version also adds support for using Box, Dropbox, OneDrive and Google Drive as remote sources.
  Office 365
  This version adds support for backing up Office 365 tenants, including mailboxes, calendars, contacts, OneDrive, Planner, Tasks, Teams, Sites, and more.
  Like the rest of Duplicati, the source code for this is available, but unlike the rest of Duplicati, this feature is not OSI open-source, and requires a license to use in production.
  In the current version, there is a limit of 5 users + 5 sites + 5 groups for testing.
  If you prefer a clean OSI open-source build, you can set the environment variable DUPLICATI_DISABLE_PROPRIETARY_MODULES or simply delete the files named Duplicati.Proprietary.* from your installation.
  Templating engine for reporting
  Thanks to @AndyBodnar, it is now possible to use a Handlebars template to format the report output, which is especially nice for crafting emails.
  Quality of life fixes
  This version now saves the current state of the commandline-inside-the-UI feature, so when you go back, it will retain the setup, making it much simpler to iterate and try out commands.
  We also added the long-requested "Edit as text" option to the source paths and filters, so you can now either use the UI or edit the paths and filters as text.
  The releases now also include an AppImage for Linux, so it can be used on Linux without needing to install it.
  Finally, we added support for the Hungarian, Czech and Polish languages. Thanks to the super translators!
  Bugfixes
  This version includes a number of bugfixes targeting stability, where Duplicati now handles more edge cases, and is more robust against errors.
  Additionally:
  - The --dry-run option has been fixed to strictly not touch data.
  - The --changed-files option has been fixed to not introduce extra dangling file entries.
  - The purge operation has been fixed to count size reduction more correct, use a faster query, and an option to disable size stats, should it still be too slow.
  - Filen MFA login was updated a bit but the fix does not create long-lived tokens yet.
