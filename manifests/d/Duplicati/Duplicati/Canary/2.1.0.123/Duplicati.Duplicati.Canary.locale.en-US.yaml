ReleaseNotes: |-
  This release is a canary release intended to be used for testing.
  This version is nearly identical to 2.1.0.121 which has a startup crash.
  This version is nearly identical to 2.1.0.122 which has an issue with detached TrayIcon.
  Major changes in this version
  This version introduces a new SQLite library, a new VSS provider, and some minor bugfixes.
  SQLite update
  This version has changed the SQLite library from the previous System.Data.SQLite library to using Microsoft.Data.Sqlite.
  This update was quite invasive, as the new SQLite library does not support positional arguments in SQL queries, which was used extensively in the Duplicati codebase.
  With the update we see measurable speedups across all queries, and we are producing an article that describes our findings.
  The update also bumps the SQLite library to use the latest available version and makes all SQLite queries async and cancelable, making the stop commands more responsive.
  New VSS provider supprt
  The AlphaVSS library that is used for creating VSS snapshots is no longer being maintained.
  This version now defaults to using the Vanara API layer to call the Windows VSS API and create snapshots.
  Like before, this still requires the VC++ Redist to be installed.
  For now, it is still possible to use AlphaVSS by setting --snapshot-provider=AlphaVSS.
  Note that neither works on ARM64 as Windows is lacking libraries and tools for native ARM64 snapshots, only --snapshot-provider=WMIC works on ARM64.
