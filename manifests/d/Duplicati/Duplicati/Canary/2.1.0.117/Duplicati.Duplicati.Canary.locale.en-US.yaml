ReleaseNotes: |-
  This release is a canary release intended to be used for testing.
  Major changes in this version
  This update adresses a few edge cases where a crash or other problem could cause the database to become out-of-sync.
  Support for "archived" files makes Duplicati more compatible with life-cycle rules, that moves files into longer-term storage.
  The support is currently added for S3 and Azure Blob Storage, and works by not attempting to test files that are archived.
  Compacting still needs to be turned off if using life-cycle rules where files are inacessible.
  The version of the local database is updated to v15 to support the archive timestamp.
  A new tool is added Duplicati.CommandLine.DatabaseTool.exe / duplicati-database-tool which can downgrade databases.
  The tool can be used prior to installing an older version, and will downgrade the database to the previous version (14 in this case).
  The tool can target individual databases, but will default to take all databases in the storage folder.
  Throttle options were broken with a recent update. The fixed version now shares the throttle between all transfers.
  Previously, setting a 10kb/s limit would cause each individual stream to be capped to 10 kb/s, but now the setting will throttle the combined upload speed (each stream gets a fraction of the limit).
  Detailed list of changes:
  - Added additional libICU compatibility versions
  - Fixed an issue where dlist files would be uploaded ahead of time, causing failures on crashes
  - Fixed an issue where compacting would sometimes kick off incorrectly
  - File backend now throws the correct exceptions
  - Ignore errors when closing and attempting pragma optimize
  - Support reloading the page when restoring
  - Added support for storage with archival options, like Glacier and Azure Cold storage
  - Updated warning for cases where new files are found
  - Added a database downgrade tool
  - Added option to set SQLite cache size
  - Fixed throttle not working, and made it a shared throttle
  - Fixed an issue where the backup metadata could be cleared on save
  Ngclient changes:
  - Continue button now works on editing backup
  - Overlapping display on scrolling fixed
  - Fixed Repeated background requests on some pages
  - Database screen now shows the database state
  - Improved support for resetting restore flow
  - Settings page is more reactive to changes
  - Server error messages are now shown
  - Numerous fixes and updates to the source picker page
  - Sort order and time display is now persisted in the browser
