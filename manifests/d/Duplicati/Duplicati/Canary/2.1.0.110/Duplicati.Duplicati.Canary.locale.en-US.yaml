ReleaseNotes: |-
  This release is a canary release intended to be used for testing.
  Major changes in this version
  - Restore improvements
    Building further on the new restore engine, this version has significant performance speedups during restore.
  - New signing keys
    The builds are now signed by "Duplicati Inc" for MacOS and Windows.
    The Windows signatures are now done with an extended validation (EV) certificate and should not trigger Windows Defender warnings.
  - New enumeration logic
    The enumeration of files and folders has been rewritten to better support some edge cases.
  - Improved pagination support
    All backends are updated to support the new list methods that supports pagination and cancellation.
    The test method will now only load a single page of results, instead of listing all items.
  - Support for backend-as-source
    This version has support for backups of both remote and local data.
    In this version, S3, IDrive, SSH and CIFS sources are supported.
    The UI does not yet support this, but it is possible to read data from a remote location by "mounting" it into the local filesystem.
    For the commandline (and manual text entry in the UI) enter sources such as:
  // Linux/MacOS
  @/mnt/s3-data|s3://example?auth-username=...
  // Windows
  @X:\server1|cifs://server/share?auth-username=...
