ReleaseNotes: |-
  Additions- Tasks in the 'to-do' group are now reorderable! This is currently an experimental feature (can be enabled under 'Advanced') since there are some slight visual bugs left to work out.
  - Spellcheck can now be toggled on/off. No need to deal with distracting squiggly red lines - spell how you like!
  Changes- Task/task group animations significantly improved- Removing tasks from a group no longer results in the remaining tasks instantly going to their new place - they are now animated, resulting a much smoother overall appearance.
  - Removing tasks from a group is now instantaneous - they are immediately popped out of the list, and surrounding tasks will immediately fill in that new gap.

  Bugfixes- Offline startup mode now loads tasks properly, following a bug introduced in v2.1.6
