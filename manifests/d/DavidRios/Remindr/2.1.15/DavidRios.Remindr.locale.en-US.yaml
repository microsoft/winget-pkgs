ReleaseNotes: |-
  Some bugfixes
  - Dropdowns are now normal
    - Dropdowns don't scroll with you anymore — scrolling is now disabled when a dropdown is open, as it should be.
    - If a dropdown is on a scrollable page, the position of its options remains unchanged. It stays attached to the dropdown — why it was separate was beyond me.
  - When automatically starting up in online mode, login screen no longer briefly appears between loading screens
  - Account menu is no longer openable in offline mode
