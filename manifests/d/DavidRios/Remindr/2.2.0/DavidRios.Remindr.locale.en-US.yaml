  3-Day View
  3-day view — the new default view — lets you look at yesterday's, today's, and tomorrow's tasks in a more organized way.
  You can have tasks with/without reminders in the same day, and arrange them in any order regardless of their due date!

  Additions
  - Task edit menu
    - Save/cancel buttons now appear when making any changes to notes/subtasks. This should make it easier to know when your changes are being saved or discarded.
    - Added button to close task edit menu
    - Added button to mark a task as complete/incomplete in the task edit menu
  Changes
  - Removed task group height animations to improve performance/visual stability
  - Task edit menu is now on the right side of the screen
  Improvements
  - Performance is greatly improved when opening/closing task create/edit menus, since most of the app was being re-rendered every time either of these menus were opened. This is no longer the case.
  Bugfixes
  - Notifications now load properly after inactivity (#5)
  - Window now opens when opening from start menu when hidden
  - Box shadow no longer appears above task edit menu
  - Many little visual bugfixes
