ReleaseNotes: |-
  - If you had a reminder set on Remindr, but your computer was turned off or Remindr was closed during that time, it can now be triggered once your computer is back on/Remindr is reopened.
  - Background overlay opacity setting added
  - Helps lighter background images contrast better with light theme
  - Theme can now stay in sync with your system's (if your computer is in light/dark mode, so is Remindr)
  - Ctrl + Click on skip button for recurring reminders (in right-click dropdown) skips reminder until it's no longer overdue
  - Reminder edit window now has close button on top right (instead of being on the bottom-left)
  - Hotkey for hyperlinking in notes changed from Ctrl + L to Ctrl + K
  - _Many_ small UI fixes
