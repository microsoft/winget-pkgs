  Additions
  Recurring reminders got some love this update (#10, thanks again @MonolithOrchids!). You can now customize their frequency and duration.
  - Frequency: how often should this reminder repeat?
    - custom amount of minutes/hours/days/weeks/months/years
    - weekdays
  - Duration: until when should this reminder repeat?
    - forever (default)
    - custom amount of reminders (e.g. only repeat three times)
    - until a certain date

  - New outline for currently selected reminder (makes it easier to tell which reminder you're currently creating/editing)
  ─────────────────┬────────────────
  Creating reminder│Editing reminder
  ─────────────────┼────────────────

  - Task list tile: hovering over reminder icon for task with multiple reminders shows the number of overdue reminders (if there are any)

  Bugfixes
  - Task edit menu correctly updates itself when the selected task changes while editing (e.g. task is completed/snoozed through notification)
  - Placeholder reminder tile now correctly disappears when leaving scheduled reminder edit menu by clicking on another reminder tile
  - Completing task/marking task incomplete in task edit menu triggers the correct undo notification (says 'completed'/'marked incomplete' instead of 'updated')
