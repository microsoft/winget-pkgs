  A new beginning
  Remindr is now open-source! The remindr_releases repo is going to be deprecated in favor of this one, which will house code, actions, releases, issues, and discussions.
  The app is currently in the final stages of migrating from electron-react-boilerplate to @cawa-93/vite-electron-builder, which helped immensely with the headaches that migrating from CommonJS to ESM gave me. On top of migrating from CommonJS to ESM, dependencies are up-to-date (currently Electron v31, ESLint v9, etc.), SonarCloud integration has been set up (7% coverage ðŸš€), as well as a CI/CD workflow for unit/integration/e2e testing with Vitest and Playwright.
  After this large migration, it should hopefully be easier to make changes/fixes while avoiding regression, and you can help to add new features/make bugfixes if you'd like. I'm brand-new to this whole open-source thing, but I'm a huge fan of the concept and want to hit the ground running as fast as possible.
