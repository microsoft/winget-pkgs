ReleaseNotes: |-
  This update adds JPEG XL (*.jxl) support, improves quantization color quality, updates AVIF loading to better handle mapping HDR images to SDR, and fixes some bugs.
  - New: JPEG XL (*.jxl) images are now supported by way of bundling @null54's JpegXLFileType plugin
  - Fixed the Levels adjustment not honoring the active selection.
  - Fixed some more mouse cursor issues when completing certain actions with certain tools.
  - Fixed some keyboard shortcuts in the Adjustments menu not working reliably.
  - Fixed most cases of tooltips blinking on/off when drawn near the bottom of the screen (thanks @toe_head2001!).
  - Fixed some new high-DPI scaling issues in toolbar dropdowns.
