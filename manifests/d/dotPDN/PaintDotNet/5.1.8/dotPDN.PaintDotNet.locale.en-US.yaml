ReleaseNotes: |-
  This is a simple maintenance release that mostly fixes a few small bugs, and updates the bundled DDS FileType plugin.
  - Fixed an issue where a JPEG with an XYZ color profile was taking a very long time to load
  - Fixed the ability to use relative paths to open images via paintdotnet.exe when Paint.NET is already open
  - New: Added +/- buttons in the toolbar for the Text tool's font size
  - Improved the robustness of file saving in pathological scenarios (e.g. power outage at the very end of saving)
  - Added a /resetWindows command-line parameter to assist in troubleshooting scenarios
  - Updated the bundled DDSFileTypePlus plugin to v1.12.13 (thanks @null54!)
