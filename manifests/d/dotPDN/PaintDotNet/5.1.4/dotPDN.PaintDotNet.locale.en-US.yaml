ReleaseNotes: |-
  This update is mostly a hotfix that fixes installation on Windows Server systems.
  - Fixed: Installation on Windows Server will no longer fail with an error about a missing srclient DLL.
  - Improved: When saving an image fails due to Windows Defender's "Controlled Folder Access" setting, the error message will mention that instead of being a generic "I/O failure" message.
  - New: GIF Comment metadata is now preserved. It maps to EXIF Photo.UserComment tags.
  - Improved: Consolidated the number of threads used for Async Present from 3 per image (canvas, left ruler, top ruler) to 3 total.
  - Improved: ColorManagementEffect now supports DxgiColorSpace color contexts (for plugin developers).
