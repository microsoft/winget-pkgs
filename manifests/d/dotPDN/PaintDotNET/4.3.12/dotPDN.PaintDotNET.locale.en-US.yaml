ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Fixed a bug when using Crop to Selection where the image would scroll away to the corner
  - Fixed a rendering bug in the brush tools that would cause some sections of the brush stroke to be rendered twice, making them darker
  - Added the PdnBaseForm.IsAppThemeDark property so that plugins with custom UI can more easily be dark theme aware
  - Fixed a rare crash in the rendering engine due to a race condition
  - Fixed a crash when using multiple monitors plugged into multiple GPUs from different manufacturers (e.g. AMD vs. NVIDIA), while moving the window between monitors (NotCurrentlyAvailableException)
  - Updated the bundled WebPFileType plugin to v1.3.14.0 (thanks @null54!).
  - Updated the bundled AvifFileType to v1.1.20.0 (thanks @null54!).
