  Protect downloads with Dolphin DRM
  Many publisher partners have concerns around security of book content and therefore require libraries to ensure distributed content is secure, so that it can’t be used outside the targeted reading system.
  Dolphin offers - and encourages library partners use - the Dolphin Digital Rights Management (DRM). This secures the downloaded content on the users’ local device, to prohibit misuse. It means the user is not able to copy large amounts of text to the device’s clipboard.
  The Dolphin DRM does not require any backend changes for the library partner, as the protection scheme is applied on the download requests in EasyReader App.
  The Dolphin DRM solution is available for downloaded DAISY, EPUB, MP3 audio and other formats on request. Dolphin DRM is currently used by:
  - Calibre Audio (UK)
  - Passend Lezen (Netherlands)
  - Tibi (Norway)
  For more information about Dolphin DRM, and to organise this for your library, please contact the team at easyreader@yourdolphin.com

  Fixes and improvements for library partners
  In close partnership with our library partners, the latest update to version 11.05 includes these fixes:
  - Éole (France): Download fix
  A fix has been applied to enable downloads for more book types.
  - RNIB Bookshare (UK)
  Fix to ‘My Assigned Books’ pagination. It now supports more than 10 books in this category.
  - MathML
  MathML expressions in EPUB now contains displays which include italics and spacing.
  - SVG
  A fix has been applied for some SVG images in EPUB, so they now display correctly.
  - EasyReader App language updates mean that the EasyReader App is available in most languages.
  Library Services Around the World
  EasyReader App is trusted by blind, partially sighted and neurodivergent readers around the world. EasyReader App now provides free global access to 49 accessible book and newspaper services, with more expected to join in 2025!
  Dolphin remains committed to empowering people who are print impaired to read in a way that is accessible for them.
  Together, our collaboration continues to remove barriers to accessible reading.
