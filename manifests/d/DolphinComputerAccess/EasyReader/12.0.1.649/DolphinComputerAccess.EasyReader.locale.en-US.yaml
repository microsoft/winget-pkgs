  New features and improvements in EasyReader version 12

  Accessibility and Usability
  EasyReader App is designed to remove barriers to reading, to make reading accessible for everyone.  Now, it’s better than ever! Version 12 offers you an upgraded and improved user interface, which makes menus, logins, library access, and readability even more intuitive and accessible.
  If you’re a reader with dyslexia, vision impairments, or other reading needs, EasyReader App version 12 ensures a seamless experience which opens a world of accessible books.
  - New icons and colours are used throughout the app to improve compliance with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).
  - It's now easier for premium users to sign in to the app, to make the most of their Personal or Education plan. The side menu is updated, with access to 'My Account' displayed prominently.
  - Quickly monitor reading progress using the 'My Books' view. A new icon displays what percentage of the book has been read.
  - 
    Driven by helpful feedback from our library partners and app users, version 12 makes EasyReader more intuitive and easier to use.

  Reader View Improvements

  Easier to use
  Now more user-friendly than ever, version 12 has bigger buttons, clearer navigation and a simplified button layout. This offers users easier ways to navigate books and view the information they need, in the ways which are accessible to them.

  - Some buttons have been relocated to make them more intuitive to find, and users can adjust the Reader View to their own preferences in the new Navigation Settings view.
  - Full Screen Mode

    Make the most of the whole screen when you're reading! Version 12 introduces Full Screen mode, activated by a single tap on the screen. In Navigation Settings you can simplify the play options further.
  - Screen Reader View
    Version 12 introduces the innovative Screen Reader View, designed to enhance the experience of vision impaired readers. It provides a linear reading mode, optimised for braille readers and screen readers.

    Following valuable feedback from readers, version 12 Screen Reader View addresses the frustrations vision impaired readers had when locating their reading position.
  - This means no more hassle or wasted time trying to find your place, just reliable continuity when you resume reading. Bookmarking  is effortless, so readers can pick up right where they left off without fail.

    Additionally, switching between Screen Reader View and the standard Web View is quick and intuitive. This gives readers flexibility to tailor their reading experience

    Please note that a screen reader is not necessary to use this feature.

  EasyReader Help Incorporating AI Technology
  - AI technology is now integrated into EasyReader App Help, so finding answers to your queries is quicker and more intuitive!

    Simply type your question and the AI help system searches through Dolphin manuals, help articles and EasyReader App training material, to instantly give you easy to follow instructions.
  - Vision impaired readers can now retrieve a description of images in books and documents. The integration of AI technology means you can simply tap on an image in a book and that image is described. If you'd like a more detailed description, simply ask more questions and it will be instantly provided! Please note that this is a paid-for feature, available with EasyReader Personal and EasyReader Education plans.
  - Online support and training is available at the Dolphin website to help you get the most from EasyReader App. Please note that telephone and email support is not available for EasyReader App.

  Study Features
  - Organise Books
    To help you organise your book list, readers can now tag books and documents in My Books with a colour of their choice.
    So for example, you might tag geography text books with a green tag, and history books in yellow. This then helps you quickly access the books you need to use in lessons, by filtering the content in My Books by colour: e.g. only see my green books.

  - Export Notes
    Save time when using and compiling references in assignments. A new study feature has been added in version 12 that enables readers to export notes, bookmarks and Harvard references to an external file, or into another app on their device.

  - Google Classroom
    references For schools using Google Classroom, EasyReader can now access all shared documents. some will open in the Reader View as before, and other shared content will open in the default web browser on the device.

  Please note that an EasyReader Education or EasyReader Personal plan is required to access these premium study features.

  Additional Fixes and Improvements
  - MathML: We have updated to the latest MathCAT library, which introduces new language support, including Swedish and Finnish.
  - Fix: We have implemented a more secure method to store the current reading position during ongoing playback.

  - Calibre Audio: EasyReader App version 12 comes with a new implementation for Calibre Audiobooks (UK).
