ShortDescription: The self-hosted search, analysis, and alerting server built for structured logs and traces.
Description: |-
  Structured logs are the observability pillar that uniquely models your apps and services. They capture the detailed, domain-specific events you need to debug tough problems, and they're perfect for monitoring and analyzing system behavior in real time.
  Seq is built from the ground up for modern structured logging. Events are captured as fully-structured JSON data, and Seq's query language makes it natural to search and manipulate them without awkward parsing or format handling.
  Seq accepts logs via HTTP, OpenTelemetry/OTLP, custom inputs, and the seqcli command-line client, with plug-ins or integrations available for .NET, Java, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, Docker, message queues, and many other technologies.
