ShortDescription: DOSBox Staging is a modern continuation of DOSBox — your existing configurations will continue to work, and you will have access to many advanced features.
Description: |-
  DOSBox Staging is a modern continuation of DOSBox with advanced features and current development practices.
  It is a (mostly) drop-in replacement for older DOSBox versions—your existing configurations will continue to work, and you will have access to many advanced features.
  DOSBox Staging comes with sensible defaults, so you’ll need to write a lot less configuration than with older DOSBox versions. Most games and applications require no tweaking and will work fine with the stock settings. However, the extensive configuration options and advanced features are available if you wish to delve deeper. Please refer to the Feature highlights on our front page to learn more about these.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  The focus of this minor maintenance release is to fix a few regressions introduced in 0.82.0, and to add a few small enhancements.
  Regression fixes
  - Fixed dual-mouse gaming support not working on Windows. This broke the dual-mouse feature in the The Settlers and The Settlers II: Veni, Vidi, Vici on Windows only.
  - A new file_locking setting has been introduced to allow disabling file locking (previously, file locking was always enabled). Setting file_locking = off fixes the regression of the demo Astral Blur by The Black Lotus not starting up. Please refer to the setting's description to learn more (e.g., run config -h file_locking from the DOS prompt).
  - Fixed a regression where configuration settings were handled in a case-sensitive manner across the board (they should be case-insentive; e.g., cpu_cycles, CPU_CYCLES and Cpu_CYCles should refer to the same setting).
  Enhancements and fixes
  - Now you can queue setting changes that are unchangeable at runtime. The queued setting will be applied on the next emulator restart (via the config -r command or the restart hotkey). For example, execute the following commands to change the machine type to CGA and use 1 MB of RAM:
    machine cga
    memsize 1
    config -r
  - Config files written with config -wc PATH and -wcd commands now have a blank line inserted after each setting's description to improve readability.
  - Fixed a bug where certain startup_verbosity settings could lead to a blank console.
