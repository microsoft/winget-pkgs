ShortDescription: DOSBox Staging is a modern continuation of DOSBox — your existing configurations will continue to work, and you will have access to many advanced features.
Description: |-
  DOSBox Staging is a modern continuation of DOSBox with advanced features and current development practices.
  It is a (mostly) drop-in replacement for older DOSBox versions—your existing configurations will continue to work, and you will have access to many advanced features.
  DOSBox Staging comes with sensible defaults, so you’ll need to write a lot less configuration than with older DOSBox versions. Most games and applications require no tweaking and will work fine with the stock settings. However, the extensive configuration options and advanced features are available if you wish to delve deeper. Please refer to the Feature highlights on our front page to learn more about these.
