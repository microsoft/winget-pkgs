  InstaMonitr enhances the standard Windows screen duplication or extension with a variety of new features and options, making it the ultimate tool for managing large-screen projections. With InstaMonitr, you can easily display any part of your desktop, add scrolling text, manage windows, and display graphics from your clipboard. The software comes equipped with two graphic editors. Whether you're presenting at a business meeting, conference, seminar, or lecture, InstaMonitr is the perfect tool to manage your content and make it more engaging and interactive for your audience.
  Software is designed to manage and project the contents of your computer screen onto a secondary screen, such as a projector screen, TV, or any other display.
