Whether you're presenting at a business meeting, conference, seminar, or lecture, InstaMonitr is the perfect tool to manage your content and make it more engaging and interactive for your audience.
  Software is designed to manage and project the contents of your computer screen onto a secondary screen, such as a projector screen, TV, or any other display.
