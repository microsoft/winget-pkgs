ReleaseNotes: |-
  Added
  - We are now catching and logging unhandled errors and rejected promises!
  Changed
  - The Application menu in the menubar will now show DAWG on Windows and Linux (this was done automatically on MacOS).
  Fix
  - Extension loading now working on Windows.
    Previously a path issue caused some extensions to not be loaded.
  - Fixed menubar and context menus in Windows.
    Previously small discrepancies in the behavior of these items between operating systems prevented them from functioning properly.
