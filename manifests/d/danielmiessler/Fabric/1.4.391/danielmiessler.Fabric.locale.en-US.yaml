  PR #1965 by infinitelyloopy-bt: fix(azure): Fix deployment URL path for Azure OpenAI API
  - Fixed deployment URL path construction for Azure OpenAI API to correctly include deployment names in request URLs
  - Added custom middleware to transform API paths and extract deployment names from request body model fields
  - Moved StreamOptions configuration to only apply to streaming requests, as Azure rejects stream_options for non-streaming requests
  - Added Azure OpenAI troubleshooting documentation with technical details and configuration guidance
  - Resolved SDK route matching bug that was preventing proper URL generation for Azure OpenAI endpoints
