  Changes
  PR #1999 by ghrom: feat: add 3 patterns from cross-model AI dialogue research
  - Add audit_consent pattern for detecting manufactured consent via power asymmetry analysis, surfaced from a devil's advocate "consent theater" critique across multi-model stress testing.
  - Add detect_silent_victims pattern to identify harmed parties who cannot speak for themselves, including future generations and unaware victims.
  - Add audit_transparency pattern for evaluating whether decisions are explainable to affected parties across five dimensions.
  - Register all three new patterns in pattern descriptions and extracts JSON files, and categorize them under ANALYSIS and CR THINKING in suggest_pattern.
  - Update pattern_explanations.md with renumbered entries to reflect the newly added patterns.
