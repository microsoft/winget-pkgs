ShortDescription: A nonlinear 2D puzzle platformer taking place in impossible spaces.
Description: |-
  AAAAXY is a nonlinear 2D puzzle platformer taking place in impossible spaces.

  Although your general goal is reaching the surprising end of the game,
  you are encouraged to set your own goals while playing.
  Exploration will be rewarded, and secrets await you!

  So jump and run around, and enjoy losing your sense of orientation in this World of Wicked Weirdness.
  Find out what Van Vlijmen will make you do. Pick a path, get inside a Klein Bottle,
  recognize some memes, and by all means: don't look up.

  And beware of a minor amount of trolling.

  To reach the end, a new player will take about 4 to 6 hours,
  a full playthrough can be finished in about 1 hour and the end can be reached in about 15 minutes.
