ShortDescription: Source code documentation and analysis tool
Description: Doxygen is a widely-used documentation generator tool in software development. It automates the generation of documentation from source code comments, parsing information about classes, functions, and variables to produce output in formats like HTML and PDF. By simplifying and standardizing the documentation process, Doxygen enhances collaboration and maintenance across diverse programming languages and project scales.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Minor incompatibilities
  - As of doxygen version 1.13.1 and layout version 2.0, Doxygen will insert defaults for elements that are missing in the user defined layout file. This allows for the introduction of new elements, without having to update the user defined layout files to make them appear. For older Doxygen or layout versions, missing elements are still treated as being invisible as before.
