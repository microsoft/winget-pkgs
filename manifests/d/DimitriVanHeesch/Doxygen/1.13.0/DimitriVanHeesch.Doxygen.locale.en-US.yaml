ShortDescription: Source code documentation and analysis tool
Description: Doxygen is a widely-used documentation generator tool in software development. It automates the generation of documentation from source code comments, parsing information about classes, functions, and variables to produce output in formats like HTML and PDF. By simplifying and standardizing the documentation process, Doxygen enhances collaboration and maintenance across diverse programming languages and project scales.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Minor incompatibilities
  - The defaults for DISABLE_INDEX and GENERATE_TREEVIEW have been changed to YES. If you did not specify them explicitly in your config file and wish to keep the same output, you need to add
    DISABLE_INDEX     = NO
    GENERATE_TREEVIEW = NO
    to your config file.
  - If you have README.md files in subdirectories, they will be treated as directory descriptions. You can disable this by setting IMPLICIT_DIR_DOCS=NO in your config file.
