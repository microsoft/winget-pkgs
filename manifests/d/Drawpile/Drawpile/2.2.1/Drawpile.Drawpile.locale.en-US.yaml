ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Fix: Default to previous directory when saving a fresh file. Thanks Crow for reporting.
  - Feature: Allow toggling performance-related canvas view settings, since some systems get slowdowns. Thanks DevonJP for reporting.
  - Fix: Don't force TLS socket algorithms, since ECDSA certs seem to not like them. Thanks Bluestrings for reporting.
  - Fix: Log message queue read, write and timeout errors properly. Thanks Pepper for reporting.
  - Feature: Implement WebSocket support in the server, available with the --websocket-port and --websocket-listen options.
  - Feature: Send keepalive messages from the server, if the client indicates support for it. Avoids them disconnecting when too busy uploading to send a ping.
  - Feature: Active user counts for sessions. A user counts as active if they drew in the last five minutes.
  - Feature: Make invite links indicated web client capability and NSFM-ness of sessions so that the invite page can show a "join in the browser" button and an appropriate notice respectively. Thanks Blozzom for suggesting the latter.
  - Fix: Properly handle cancelling a connection while it's being established. Thanks Fox for reporting.
  - Server Fix: When hosting without an account is enabled, also allow it for anyone with an account. Thanks ahaven for finding this.
  - Fix: Don't resize brush settings unnecessarily larger when switching between brush types. Thanks Meiren for reporting.
  - Fix: Try to handle switching between tablet pen and eraser more consistently. Thanks Daystream for reporting.

  - Fix: Don't reset opacity multiply inputs to default when loading a brush that doesn't have it set. Thanks Blozzom for reporting.
  - Fix: Limit MyPaint brush dab counts to more sensible values, since the defaults from MyPaint are pointlessly high and can cause chugging. Thanks Blozzom for reporting.
  - Fix: Don't blink last user cursors again when making a selection.
  - Fix: Make user cursors trail MyPaint brush strokes better, only smoothing it out when there's jitter. Thanks Blozzom for reporting.

  - Fix: Properly show censored layers in the list even when they are revealed.
  - Server Fix: Allow reading users' trusted status through the API, because it's something you can write through it.
  - Server Feature: Allow limiting the maximum number of users per session. Moderators and administrators can override this.

  - Server Fix: Don't report temporary server bans as permanent. Thanks Bluestrings for reporting.
  - Server Fix: Properly convert between IPv4 and IPv6 when checking IP bans. Thanks Bluestrings for reporting.
  - Fix: Use proper measurements to decide on how much painting to do in a single step, hopefully preventing chugging caused by certain brushes.
  - Server Fix: Save catchup keys to file-backed sessions so that the counter doesn't reset upon a server restart.
  - Fix: Don't show user cursors while catchup dialog is open.
  - Feature: Add some bulk permission commands for (un)trusting and setting layer tiers, explanation available through /modhelp. Thanks Bluestrings for suggesting.
