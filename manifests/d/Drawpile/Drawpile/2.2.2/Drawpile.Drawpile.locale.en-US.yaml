ReleaseNotes: |-
  Code signing policy: https://drawpile.net/codesigningpolicy/
  - Fix: Make annotations not cause glitches when moving them around when using the software renderer. Thanks Meru for reporting.
  - Feature: Add -u/--users parameter to dprectool, which will print out a table of user statistics along with names and ids.
  - Feature: Add --include-user-ids parameter to dprectool, allowing to pass a comma-separated list of user ids to only include visual changes from.
  - Fix: Work around WebKit bug 284752 that prevents Drawpile from working on Safari 18. Thanks grimsley for reporting.
  - Fix: Correct weird letter spacing in the font rendering on Windows. Thanks Sinamer for reporting.
  - Feature: Make reset images a bit smaller and much faster. This speeds up manual session resets, canvas compression, hosting and joins in the builtin server. Thanks mukihyena for reporting.
  - Fix: Generate the catchup image in the background when hosting on the builtin server, rather than hanging the client. Thanks mukihyena for reporting.
  - Server Fix: Additional checks and logging to avoid and diagnose temporary failures in streamed resets. Thanks Will for reporting.
  - Fix: Slightly delay restoring dock layouts after the window is resized to avoid a crash on macOS. Thanks Axocrat for reporting.
  - Fix: Properly update the checkbox on View > Full Screen if the OS forces the application out of it. Thanks Sinamer for reporting.
  - Fix: Restore window maximized after exiting the application from full screen mode. Thanks Sinamer for reporting.
  - Fix: Only remember dock sizes when the window is maximized or full screen on operating systems where that's possible to tell. Thanks Meiren for reporting.
  - Fix: Make tablet positions work on Cintiqs under Windows Ink with UI scaling and when it's not set to be the primary monitor. The old behavior is available via Edit > Tablet Driver > Windows Ink Non-Native, in case this breaks something else. Thanks Axocrat and Liz for reporting, Weenifer for reporting and testing, Maffi for reporting additional issues.
  - Fix: Remove the "KisTablet" prefix from the tablet driver names in Windows, it's a technical name that doesn't add anything useful.
  - Feature: Indicate when you have no layer selected so that it doesn't seem like you can draw but nothing happens.
  - Server Fix: Remove browser users when a session's password is removed and the server only allows browsers in passworded sessions. Thanks Bluestrings for reporting.
  - Server Feature: Add a separate permission for hosting via browser and whether to take this permission from ext-auth. This also fixes the issue where it would ask you to log in when trying to host from the browser, just to then tell you that you're not allowed to do so anyway. Thanks Bluestrings for suggesting.
  - Removed Feature: Username lists in external session announcements. They were never used.
  - Fix: Show current tier in the layer permissions menu again. Thanks Meiren for reporting.
  - Fix: Reduce selection outline resolution instead of punting to the blue selection mask when it gets too large. Thanks Meru, MorrowShore and Shane for reporting.
  - Server Feature: Invite codes, allowing inviting people with revokable links that override regular session restrictions. Thanks Bluestrings and Liz for suggesting.
  - Removed Feature: Toggling between web and direct links in the invite dialog. Drawpile will translate the web link if you paste it into the join dialog anyway, so the distinction was pointless.
  - Fix: Change temporary tool switch setting text to say that only the primary shortcut will cause it. This was unintentional, but it's useful. Thanks 3rd_EFNO for reporting.
  - Fix: Use proper background images in Windows installer instead of those ugly red discs. Thanks evilTriangle for reporting.
  - Fix: Correct intermittent errors when connecting, reconnecting or otherwise opening a new main view in the browser that could hang the application.
  - Feature: Allow hiding the color history swatches on individual color docks. Thanks Stickly for suggesting.
  - Fix: Make pan, zoom, inspector and color picker tools not get locked by the session catching up or resetting. Thanks Greendyno for reporting.
  - Fix: Don't show canvas during catchup when using software renderer.
  - Fix: Fix keyboard shortcuts, enter and backspace not reacting on some devices in the browser. Thanks Greendyno for reporting.
  - Fix: Keep leading spaces and zeroes the same when creating or duplicating a layer. Thanks Greendyno for reporting.
  - Feature: Allow making the application full-screen in the browser, using View > Full Screen. Thanks Windy for suggesting.
  - Fix: Make user markers not leave streaks in the software renderer when fractional UI scaling is involved. Thanks lambda20xx for reporting.
  - Feature: Add constrain and center buttons to the transform tool, for the equivalent of holding Shift and Alt when you don't have a keyboard. Thanks MachKerman for suggesting.
  - Fix: Don't crash on invalid certificates when connecting via WebSocket. Thanks IZUHU for reporting.
  - Feature: Set user agent header when connecting via WebSocket using the client. Thanks Meru for suggesting.
  - Feature: Allow adding a "w" query parameter to session URLs to connect via WebSocket instead. Thanks IZUHU for suggesting.
  - Fix: Remember whether a host was connected to via WebSocket by adding the "w" query parameter to it.
  - Server Feature: Add a "prefer WebSockets" option. Clients will generate appropriate invite links and announcements will contain this preference.
  - Server Fix: Allow refreshing external bans even when the section is locked. Thanks Bluestrings for reporting.
  - Feature: Add -i/--image option to the drawpile-cmd command, to allow e.g. converting an ORA to a PNG file or similar on the command line.
  - Feature: Add PSD and WEBP format support to the drawpile-cmd command.
  - Fix: Don't reset reference dock position when toggling dock visibility. Thanks izzy for reporting.
  - Fix: Remove language selection in the web version for now, since it doesn't do anything. Thanks Albano Battistella for reporting.
  - Feature: Allow setting the language in the web version using a query parameter. Many languages don't work properly, but this allows setting it before starting the thing and then having to change it.
  - Fix: Show and select existing track title when renaming it. Thanks Greendyno for reporting.
  - Fix: Properly resize login dialog on Android when showing session listings so that you can actually read something.
  - Fix: Don't make kinetic touch scrolling jerk around when moving the finger over the scroll bar.
  - Fix: Properly linkify URLs with an @ in the path.
  - Fix: Default kinetic scroll on Android and the browser to left-click, since that works better and also covers touch.
  - Fix: Allow dragging layers and sliding across the checkboxes in the layer list even when kinetic scrolling with left-click or touch is enabled by making the left and right areas not react to scroll. This is a patch to Qt.
  - Fix: Work around a crash on Windows when toggling kinetic scroll settings.
  - Fix: Properly show current layout on first layouts dialog run. Thanks Dib for reporting.
  - Fix: Disable image reader limit in command-line tools under Qt6.
  - Fix: Deduplicate brush and tag names when exporting brushes. Thanks Blozzom for reporting.
  - Fix: Don't crash under Windows 7 when attempting to play two sounds once. Thanks pachuco for reporting.
    2025-02-12 Version 2.2.2-beta.5
  - Feature: Color circle dock with gamut masks, available through View > Docks > Color Circle. Similar to Krita's Artistic Color Selector and MyPaint's HSV/HCY Wheel.
  - Fix: Make temporary tool switches by holding a key down work again. Thanks 3rd_EFNO and bunnie for reporting.
  - Fix: Disregard hidden layers when layer picking in frame view.
  - Feature: Add a search bar to the key frame properties dialog.
  - Fix: Reset locale to "C" after Qt messes it up on startup. Thanks Meru for reporting.
  - Fix: Don't use bilinear interpolation in transforms unnecessarily.
  - Feature: Add canvas shortcuts for changing color hue, saturation/chroma and value/lightness/luminosity. Thanks Dann DeCairns for suggesting.
  - Feature: Make size adjustment canvas shortcut depend on the speed of the drag. Thanks MorrowShore for suggesting.
  - Fix: Remove pointless permissions on Android that Qt includes by default but aren't actually used.
  - Fix: Don't default Android to fingerpaint when a pen is present.
  - Fix: Work around a crash on Android that sometimes occurs when putting your palm on the screen, which somehow leads to touch events with zero contact points. Thanks Mav for reporting.
  - Fix: Uncap aspect ratio on older Android versions. Thanks Molderche for reporting.
  - Fix: Work around modifier keys not registering when using a tablet on Wayland. Thanks Absolute Goober for reporting.
  - Server Fix: Don't pointlessly reload server certificates if they didn't change. Thanks Liz for reporting.
  - Server Fix: Work around too many authenticated users in a session, which could cause a crash. Thanks Liz for reporting.
  - Fix: Don't crash when filling with feathering and a canvas-filling selection. Thanks Meru for reporting.
  - Fix: Don't carry over HUD button presses to dock UI in small screen mode. Thanks Meru for reporting.
  - Feature: Make list action buttons in settings dialog clearer, adding an edit button for canvas shortcuts. Thanks Maffi for suggesting.
  - Fix: Work around broken transparency when copying images between canvases on Wayland. Thanks Absolute Goober for reporting.
  - Fix: Properly ignore system tablet events when using KisTablet drivers on Windows. Thanks Doc for reporting.
  - Feature: Warn when an action will close a relevant window on Android and in the browser. Thanks 3rd_EFNO for suggesting.
  - Fix: When enabling a dock and it gets put into a tab, that tab now gets activated.
