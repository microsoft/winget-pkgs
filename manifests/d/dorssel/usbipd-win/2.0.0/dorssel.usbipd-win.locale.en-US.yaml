ReleaseNotes: |-
  Breaking changes:
  • WSL requires the new instructions for setting up the usbip client on the Linux side, see https://github.com/dorssel/usbipd-win/wiki/WSL-support#usbip-client-tools
  • Updating from a previous version will require you to bind your devices again; previous bindings are not preserved.

  This update:
  • No longer requires administrator privileges on Windows when attaching/detaching a device to WSL
  • No longer requires root privileges within WSL when attaching a device
  • Enables standard users that are not a member of the Administrators group to use the WSL commands
  • Adds support for devices/hubs/filters that previously would not attach due to driver incompatibilities, using the new usbipd bind --force option
  • Adds support for preventing the host from using the device when no client has the device attached, using the new usbipd bind --force option
  • Adds support for command line completion, see https://github.com/dotnet/command-line-api/blob/main/docs/dotnet-suggest.md
  • Adds console colors to errors, warnings, and informational messages
  • Fixes support for devices that do not allow disable/enable (CR_NOT_DISABLEABLE)
  • Fixes alignment for device descriptions with non-western characters
  • Improves error reporting for common configuration errors
