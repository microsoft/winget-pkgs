  News
  Happy holidays everyone! This is a small incremental update with minor but important quality-of-life improvements.In this release we are force-disabling automatic sync with EGL. The option has caused some issues so far and we are disabling it until we can investigate more. Since this might cause some inconvenience, manual sync with the EGL is still possible through the form.What's changed
  - Make Rare more responsive when starting by dynamically loading only the visible game thumbnails.
  - Force legendary to always check for updates and refresh the token.
  - Force-disable automatic sync with EGL.
  - Disable automatic fallback to CrossOver on macOS.
