ReleaseNotes: |-
  Feature
  - support vmess 'zero' security (#2513) @fakeboboliu
  - migration go1.20
  - add meanDelay field on delay API.
  - add support for dns search domains for A/AAAA (#2597) @jeff-an
  Change
  - remove redir-host as config. since redir-host brings a lot of misunderstandings and problems (some of which are even hard to find). I decided to remove it. It is only used in the fake-ip-filter for a few domain name mappings.
    I know that it can be bypassed and "recovered" in fake-ip mode. If fake-ip-filter finds that it has been abused, I will delete the domain mapping mode completely.
  Bugfixes
  - fix a fakeip udp bug, and you can try removing some of the fake-ip-filter lists for the game
  - modify local ip to pass all test (#2595) @daveyuuuu
