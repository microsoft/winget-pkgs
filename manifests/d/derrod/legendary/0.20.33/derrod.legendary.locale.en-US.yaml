ReleaseNotes: |-
  CLI Changes
  - install command
  - info command
  - uninstall command
  Changes
  - Commands modifying the installed game data will now abort if another instance of Legendary is running a command that modifies it
  - Authentication data is now protected by a file lock to prevent two simultaneously running instances from invalidating OAuth tokens (based on #566 by @CommandMC)
  - non-TTY output is now forced to be UTF-8 to solve some issues on Windows's stupid encodings, mainly affecting Heroic
  - Game executables are now searched case-insensitively when importing to fix them not being found in some cases #542 by @CommandMC
  - Added a warning if a game ships with the Epic Online Services Installer, as it may require manual setup for the game to work properly (e.g.
    Fall Guys)
  - The downloader will now check if files exist locally to automatically redownload missing files on update rather than simply trusting the currently installed manifest
  Bug fixes
  - Fixed a crash in list-saves if a game no longer has metadata (e.g. was removed from account)
  - Fixed info command not displaying install information if DLC is available
  - Fixed a potential crash during metadata refresh if data for multiple platforms is cached locally
  - Fixed save sync always requesting all save games even if an app name is specified
  - Fixed cloud save file pattern matching not behaving the same as the Epic Games Launcher itself
  - When running update the installed version for an app is now updated even if no files changed, e.g. with Civilization VI DLC that had its version increased along the base game even though no changes were made to the files
