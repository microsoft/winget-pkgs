ShortDescription: an open-source game launcher that can download and install games from the Epic Games platform.
ReleaseNotes: |-
  Another set of long-overdue fixes, alongside a critical hotfix for the Webview login being broken.

  - `launch` command
    - DLC with executable can now be launched (e.g. Unreal Engine Editor for Fortnite)
  - `download` / `install` command
    - Added `--bind` parameter to bind to one or more IPs (e.g. to use multiple network interfaces simultaneously)

  ### Changes

  - Added support for overriding config directory via `LEGENDARY_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable

  ### Bug fixes

  - Fixed `info` command crashing if game has no custom attributes set
  - Fixed a deadlock when deleting expired user information
  - Correctly check for SDL tags and write tags to config after successful verification (#584/#608)
  - Fixed importing EGL auth on Linux (#589)
  - Fixed opening URLs on Wine, e.g. EA App/Origin game launches (#595)
  - Avoid unnecessary buffer copies in download worker (#621)
  - Fixed `list-files` not working with empty install tag `""`
  - Fixed `disable_sdl` config option
  - Added python3 shebang
