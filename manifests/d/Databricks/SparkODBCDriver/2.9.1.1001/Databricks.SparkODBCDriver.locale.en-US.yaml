ShortDescription: Simba Apache Spark ODBC Connector for direct SQL and HiveQL access to Apache Hadoop/Spark distributions.
Description: The Simba Apache Spark ODBC Connector is used for direct SQL and HiveQL access to Apache Hadoop / Spark distributions, enabling Business Intelligence (BI), analytics, and reporting on Hadoop-based data. The connector efficiently transforms an application’s SQL query into the equivalent form in HiveQL, which is a subset of SQL-92. If an application is Spark-aware, then the connector is configurable to pass the query through to the database for processing. The connector interrogates Spark to obtain schema information to present to a SQL-based application. Queries, including joins, are translated from SQL to HiveQL
