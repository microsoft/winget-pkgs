  ⚠️ Breaking Change ⚠️
  DABs now return an error when paths are incorrectly defined relative to the job or
  pipeline definition location instead of the configuration file location. Previously, the CLI would show a
  warning and fallback to resolving the path relative to the resource location. Users must update their bundle
  configurations to define all relative paths relative to the configuration file where the path is specified.
  See more details here: (#3225)Notable Changes
  - Add support volumes in Python support ([#3383])(
  Bundles
  - [Breaking Change] Remove deprecated path fallback mechanism for jobs and pipelines (#3225)
  - Add support for Lakebase synced database tables in DABs (#3467)
  - Rename Delta Live Tables to Lakeflow Declarative Pipelines in the default-python template (#3476).
  - Fixed bundle init not working on Standard tier (#3496)
