  Notable Changes
  - (via Terraform v1.92.0) DABs will no longer try to update pipeline permissions upon pipeline deletion. This fixes PERMISSION_ERROR upon 'bundle destroy'
  for pipelines that have run_as setting enabled (described in https://community.databricks.com/t95/data-engineering/dab-dlt-destroy-fails-due-to-ownership-permissions-mismatch/td-p/132101)
  The downside is that if 'permissions:' block is removed from the resource, DABs will not try anymore to restore permissions to just the owner of the pipeline.
  CLI
  - Add the --configure-serverless flag to databricks auth login to configure Databricks Connect to use serverless.
  Dependency updates
  - Upgrade Go SDK to 0.82.0 (#3769)
  - Upgrade TF provider to 1.92.0 (#3772)
  Bundles
  - Updated the internal lakeflow-pipelines template to use an "src" layout (#3671).
  - Fix for pip flags with equal sign being incorrectly treated as local file names (#3766)
