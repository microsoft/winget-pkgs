ReleaseNotes: |-
  Duxbury Systems continually revises DBT to add new features, support new and updated embossers, and fix problems, as well as to respond to the latest revisions in braille rules, operating system updates, and third party changes.
  Below you will find our advances and improvements since the prior release.
  For more sources of information, please take advantage of "Check for Updates" from your DBT Help menu. Or, visit the Duxbury Website for both new information and historical information about DBT features and updates.
  Support for SWIFT
  - DBT runs a web service that allows connectivity to a web-based implementation of SWIFT.
  - All template (.dxt) files have been to revised to correct a minor error in the names of linear styles. This will be needed to work with web-hosted editions of SWIFT.
  BANA Braille Template
  - DBT 14.1 includes BANA Braille 2024, an updated version of the BANA Braille template created by Susan Christensen.
  Language Support
  - Sotho (Northern and Southern Pedi) print-to-braille translation has been modified to update contractions per input from a South African authority, as has Tswana translation.
  - Mi'kmaq (Mi'kmaw) translation support has been added in this release.
  - The Swahili (Kenya) translators (both print-to-braille and braille-to-print) have been updated to correct the handling of a certain shortform.
  - The English/Unified (UEB) print-to-braille translation table has been has been updated to correct a problem whereby a required grade 1 indicator could be missing in certain instances where a hyphen immediately follows an expression explicitly declared to be "technical", e.g. when a "math" style is applied to just the "x" in "x-coordinate". This change also affects translation of several uncontracted languages where print-to-braille translation is derived from the UEB table and UEB learning series ("Weebee Dots") translation. Contracted forms of several unusual words have also been corrected in print-to-braille translation.
  Embosser Support
  - A top margin adjustment automatically applied to ViewPlus Columbia embossers is now also applied to Irie BrailleTrac embossers.
  Python: PDF and Macros
  - DBT includes support for importing PDF files and a general-purpose macro facility. These two major new features require support of Python, an optional installation component that may be omitted when required by network policy.
  Installer
  - Operation of the DBT installer in French is corrected.
  Mathematics
  - Importation of mathematics markup from the Equation Editor built into Microsoft Word 2007 and newer is considerably improved.
  Miscellaneous
  - DBT/Win display of error messages from failed imports is improved.
  - DBT 14.1 corrects a longstanding defect that would cause unusual instances of extra characters being inserted as the start of the first word of each page when importing .brf or .prf files.
  - Over eighty new user interface languages are new to DBT 14.1.
  We are constantly working on improved language support. If you are interested in specific language improvements, please write to us at languages@duxsys.com.
