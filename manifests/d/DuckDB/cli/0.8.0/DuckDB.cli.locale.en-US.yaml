ShortDescription: DuckDB is an in-process SQL OLAP Database Management System
Description: |-
  DuckDB is a high-performance analytical database system.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  - #7174 The default sort order switched from NULLS FIRST to NULLS LAST because this is more intuitive, especially in conjunction with LIMIT.
  - #7082 The division operator / will now always lead to a floating point result even with integer parameters.
    The new operator // retains the old semantics.
    This change is consistent with Python.
