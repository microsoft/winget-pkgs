ReleaseNotes: |-
  This is a bug fix release for various issues discovered after we released 0.10.2. There are no new major features, just bug fixes. Database files created by DuckDB v0.10.* or v0.9.* can be read by DuckDB v0.10.3.Highlights
  Even though this is "only" a bug fix release, there have been some major areas of work that warrant a separate mention:- We have added a feature to update extensions using the UPDATE EXTENSIONS syntax #11677
  - There have been some serious internal improvements around checkpointing, most notably, checkpoints can run while other connections are reading, and no longer block new connections while checkpointing #11918. Also, FORCE CHECKPOINT  no longer actively cancels transactions, it now waits until it can checkpoint #12061
  - DuckDB now has native support to load data from HuggingFace using the hf:// prefix #11831
  - We have slightly changed NULL casting behaviour with the MAP type #11745
  - The Java JDBC driver has been moved to its own repo:  #11873
  - DuckDB now cleanly compiles with -Wconversion and all conversions are actually being checked #11716, #11673
