ReleaseNotes: |-
  This release of DuckDB is named "Fusca" after the Velvet Scooter native to Europe.Note: The on-disk storage format is backwards-compatible with the 0.9 releases of DuckDB. For details, please see the release announcement blog post.Also note that we've dropped' the "Preview" designation with this release.
