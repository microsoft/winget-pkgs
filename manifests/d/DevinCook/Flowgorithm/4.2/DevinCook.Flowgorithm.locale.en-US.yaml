ShortDescription: Flowgorithm is a free beginner's programming language that is based on graphical flowcharts.
Description: |-
  Typically, when a student first learns to program, they often use one of the text-based programming languages.
  Depending on the programming language, this can either be easy or frustratingly difficult experience. Many languages
  require students to write lines of confusing code just to display the text "Hello, world!". This is normal for most
  object-oriented languages, but beginner students are far from learning these concepts.

  By using flowcharts, you can concentrate on programming concepts rather than all the nuances of a typical programming
  language. Programs can be executed directly in Flowgorithm.

  Once you understand programming logic, it is easy for you to learn one of the major languages. Flowgorithm can
  interactively convert your flowchart to over 18 languages. These include: C#, C++, Java, JavaScript, Lua, Perl, Python,
  Ruby, Swift, Visual Basic .NET, and VBA (used in Office).
