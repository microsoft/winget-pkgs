Description: |-
  MyoDAQ Acquisition offers a simplified data acquisition application intended for use with DMT wire myographs and organ bath systems. This software provides a streamlined, user friendly approach for data collection and analysis.
  Tension generated by experimental tissues are recorded in a simplified and easy to analyze manner. Different sampling rates can be easily selected to allow the level of data sensitivity for ring contractions or muscle strip twitches. By highlighting only necessary features, researchers experience improved ease-of-use, better navigation and easier control for data analysis.
  MyoDAQ data analysis is unique in being able to add multiple data selections throughout the course of the experiment in single or numerous channels. Data can be exported via a selection of the trace or the entire data file for external charting or custom analysis.
