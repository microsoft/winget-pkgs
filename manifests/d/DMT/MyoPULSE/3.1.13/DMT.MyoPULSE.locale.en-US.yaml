ShortDescription: Comprehensive controller software that allows for easy protocol creation
Description: |-
  Introducing the new MyoPULSE 3 software for the CS4+ and CS8 stimulators. MyoPULSE 3 will include a new optimized User Interface and new features based on input from experienced researchers. A key benefit of MyoPULSE 3 is allowing users to easily create complex stimulation protocols. Modification of existing protocols is quickly and efficiently completed.
  Researchers can create a single stimulation protocol containing up to 50 different frequencies, voltages and/or stimulation widths. When writing extended protocols, users now have the ability to add or delete stimulation sections anywhere in the protocol.
  MyoPULSE 3 includes a progress bar that follows the protocol in real-time. Knowing exactly where you are during a long and complex stimulation protocol allows for easy tissue response confirmation.
