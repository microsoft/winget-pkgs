ShortDescription: Edit documents in your Docusign CLM account.
Description: |-
  Docusign Edit is a desktop application that allows you to connect your desktop editing software to your Docusign CLM account. With Docusign Edit, you can edit any supporting document, such as ones from Microsoft Word. When you save changes to an open document, it creates a new version. A system check-in then occurs to create and upload the latest version of the document. Docusign CLM preserves document histories and check-ins.
  Docusign Edit uses your operating system's default program association to determine which editing application downloads and opens documents. The default program association then uses the document in Docusign Edit based on its document type or extension. For example, the default program association for files with an extension of .docx is Microsoft Word.
