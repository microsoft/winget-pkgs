  Improvements
  - Platform tags now feature version and lifecycle stage information.
  - Platform tags added to configured sections and to individual preference keys. On keys, tags appear by default only if the individual key's versions are divergent from the payload's.
  - Target devices version range can now be entered to receive out-of-range alerts on configured preference keys.
  - Key requirement is now ignored in nested-required keys whose container is not required and is not written out to the profile.
  - Documentation buttons added to individual preference keys where available.
