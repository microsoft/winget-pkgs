  Fixes and Improvements in 2.16.7
  - Fixed a general issue when iMazing was building a compressed Zip archive, following a third-party app update: "A file with the same name 'item name' already exists, could not append file to zip...". This issue was occurring while downloading apps, installing apps, exporting app data, exporting ePub books and in various other places.
  - Messages: optimized loading of messages (macOS)
  - Music: fixed width of Title, Artist and Album columns. If you encountered an issue with the width of those columns, go to the iMazing main menu: View > Media Browser > Reset media view to default settings (macOS)
