ReleaseNotes: |-
  iMazing 2.16 introduces a new method to access a device's data without requiring a full backup. This option can save considerable disk space on the computer running iMazing, and allows iMazing to be used in cases where a computer has less available storage than the capacity of the iOS or iPadOS device.

  When connecting a device for the first time and accessing a dataset that requires an iOS or iPadOS backup, iMazing will present you with two choices:
  - Full Backup, the classic method (also a restorable backup)
  - Data Access Only, the new method, which excludes some media and is not a backup

  Data Access Only vs Full Backups
  - Learn more about this new feature: https://imazing.com/guides/data-access-only-vs-full-backup-in-imazing

  iOS 16.1
  - Full compatibility with iOS 16.1.
  - iMazing and iMazing Mini support the new iOS 16.1 user prompt to initiate a backup.

  Photos
  - Now supports converting HEVC (H.265) videos to MPEG-4 (H.264). You will find the conversion options in iMazing Preferences / Photos.
  - iMazing can now download photos and videos from iCloud. When a file is not locally stored on your device, iMazing will prompt you to log in to iCloud with your Apple ID to download them. (Please note: your Apple ID and password are only used to connect to Apple servers and will remain protected in your macOS keychain or Windows credentials.)

  Other New Features
  - Change Backup Location: when changing the device backup location in the device options, iMazing now asks if you want to copy the backup and all of its archives to the new location (if there is no existing backup at this location).
  - Sidebar Contextual Menu: with Move Backup to Old Backups you can now detach a backup from its device. This is useful if you want to start a new backup while keeping the old backup accessible in Old Backups (it can be deleted later).
  - Sidebar Contextual Menu: with Delete Backup Archives and Keep only Last Backup you can delete all archives of a backup and keep only the last backup. This can be useful to reduce the size of a backup when you don't need to keep previous versions.
  - Preferences / General: a new option Open Operations popover automatically when an operation starts was added; it is enabled by default.
  - Preferences / General: a new option Clear cache when iMazing quits was added. This option is useful for privacy; a repair shop, for instance, can ensure no private customer data is stored in the cache folder when iMazing quits.
  - Preferences / Devices: a new option Remove devices and pairing records when iMazing quits was added. This option is also useful for privacy and will ensure that a device won't be accessible after iMazing quits, so that pairing the device is required when reconnecting it.
  - Erase All Content: two new options have been added: Preserve eSIM data (erases all of a device's data and settings while preserving the eSIM data) and Prevent proximity setup (prevents any proximity setup, such as transferring data from a nearby device, after the device restarts and displays the iOS Setup Assistant).

  Fixes and Improvements
  - Manage Apps: fixed an issue where new managed Apple IDs created in Apple Business or School Manager could not retrieve the list of apps purchased via Volume Purchase. iMazing will now ask for the VPP token in such cases.
