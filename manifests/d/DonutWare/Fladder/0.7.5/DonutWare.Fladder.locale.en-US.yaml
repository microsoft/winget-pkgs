  What's Changed
  Sync 2.0
  - Complete re-work of the sync database backend.
  Warning
  This version includes a database migration, switching between this and older version of Fladder might break the synced files.
  - As the name implied sync now also synchronizes play status. When you watch something offline it will sync all metadata back to the server (favorites/play progress) when you get back online.
  - Syncing is now faster allowing for easier syncing of items
  - Ability to download multiple items at once. This allows you to download an entire season or show.
  Shortcuts
  - (Desktop) Allow for defining custom shortcuts for common actions on all desktop platforms
  - Added the option to define back/forward seeking seconds. This is also synced to the user account on the server.
  - (Desktop) Scroll to change the volume of the currently playing video
