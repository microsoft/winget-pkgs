ShortDescription: Barrier is open-source KVM software
ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Barrier now supports client identity verification (fixes CVE-2021-42072, CVE-2021-42073).
  - Barrier now uses SHA256 fingerprints for establishing security of encrypted SSL connections.
    After upgrading client to new version the existing server fingerprint will need to be approved again.
    Client and server will show both SHA1 and SHA256 server fingerprints to allow interoperability with older versions of Barrier.
  - Fixed build failure on mips*el and riscv64 architecture.
  - Fixed reading of configuration on Windows when the paths contain non-ASCII characters (#976, #974, #444).
  - Barrier no longer uses openssl CLI tool for any operations and hooks into the openssl library directly.
  - More X11 clipboard MIME types have been mapped to corresponding converters (#344).
  - Fixed setup of multiple actions associated with a hotkey.
  - Fixed setup of hotkeys with special characters such as comma and semicolon (#778).

  - Added support for randomart images for easier comparison of SSL certificate fingerprints.
    The algorithm is identical to what OpenSSH uses.
