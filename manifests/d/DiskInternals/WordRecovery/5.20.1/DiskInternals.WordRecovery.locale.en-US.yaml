Description: |-
  DiskInternals Word Recovery provides the best data recovery, offering unprecedented efficiency and dealing specifically with Microsoft Word documents. It scans the file system and learns about the files that were deleted, just as the free undelete tools. Then, it scans the hard drive directly to locate Microsoft Word documents that are not shown in the file system. It uses a list of file signatures such as .DOCX, .DOC and .RTF to detect the beginning and end of Microsoft Word documents. This method works even if your hard drive is half dead!

  DiskInternals Word Recovery support file system as exFAT, NTFS, Ext2/3/4, ReiserFS, XFS, FAT, ReFS, UFS, HFS, RomFS(reader), Reiser4.

  DiskInternals Word Recovery synchronizes the results obtained with the scan of the file system with the results obtained by accessing the hard disk directly, presenting the complete list of recoverable Word documents along with their file names and contents, and yields the best ratio of recoverability.
