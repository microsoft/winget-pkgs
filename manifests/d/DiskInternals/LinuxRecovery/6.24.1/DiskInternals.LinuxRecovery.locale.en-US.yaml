Description: |-
  DiskInternals Linux Recovery is a handy no-cost utility that runs under any version of Windows and designed to recover the erased or damaged information that is kept on Ext2/Ext3/Ext4 partitions.

  Linux Recovery might come in handy on a number of occasions when due to the unforeseen contingencies there was a loss of important data stored on Ext2/Ext3/Ext4 disks.

  Linux Recovery can recover both the files you just accidentally deleted and the files which have been erased long time ago. It’s also capable of restoring corrupted files and can read and recover the information located on an inaccessible drive. The files you restore can be saved on any (including network) disk, which is visible to the host operating system.

  The utility also allows you to repair a corrupt or damaged partition table and attempt to restore a disk after a serious crash, so you’ll have a chance to repair a serious malfunction right away.

  In case you noticed that you lost a piece of valuable information only after you formatted a partition, DiskInternals Linux Recovery can unformat the disk and it’ll be up and running again.
