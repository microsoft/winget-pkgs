Description: |-
  DiskInternals Address Book Recovery offers sophisticated yet fully automatic approach to data recovery. Being a specialized data recovery application targeted to restore your Windows Address Book (WAB) contacts, it provides unprecedented success rate restoring your contact information.

  General-use data recovery applications rely on the file system to locate information about files they attempt to restore. This works relatively fine if your hard drive suffered minor damage, but it fails to do the job if your entire file system is corrupted or if you have an inaccessible disk.

  DiskInternals Address Book Recovery scans your entire hard drive looking for address book contacts in pretty much the same way as modern anti-viruses scan your hard drives for viruses. DiskInternals Address Book Recovery uses a database of characteristic signatures that unambiguously define the beginning and the end of each file.

  What if your computer is just fine as well as your hard disk, but your address book information has been lost after a crash caused by Outlook Express or another application accessing Windows Address Book? In that case your entire address book may become corrupt and unreadable by Windows or Outlook Express.
