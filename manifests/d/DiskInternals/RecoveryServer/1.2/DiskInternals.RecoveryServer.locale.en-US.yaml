ShortDescription: DiskInternals Recovery Server helps you recover damaged data without touching the remote computer. This data recovery software scans its hard drives remotely over the network.
Description: |-
  Having physical access to a computer is not always possible for a system administrator managing multiple PCs. If an important document is deleted, or a system failure renders a disk on a workstation inaccessible, youâ€™re often hard-pressed to arrive immediately on the scene to undelete the files, fix broken partitions and restore the corrupted hard drive.

  DiskInternals Recovery Server helps you recover damaged data without touching the remote computer. This data recovery software scans its hard drives remotely over the network. Utilizing encrypted communication protocols and authenticating authorized users with a login and password guarantee complete security of your data, while data compression ensures minimum bandwidth requirements. It takes just a few kilobytes of data transfers to scan the entire 80 GB partition!

  DiskInternals Recovery Server adheres to the client-server model, and supports DiskInternals Uneraser Network Edition and DiskInternals Partition Recovery clients to undelete erased files and recover broken disks and partitions respectively. You can opt to keep the recovered files on the remote computer or transfer them to your PC over the network. The server is extremely light on resources, and consumes virtually no memory and no CPU cycles while ensuring data integrity.

  DiskInternals Recovery Server is absolutely free, and is a must-have tool on any workstation. Secure your data with protection against accidental loss or deletion by running DiskInternals Recovery Server on all PCs on your network!
