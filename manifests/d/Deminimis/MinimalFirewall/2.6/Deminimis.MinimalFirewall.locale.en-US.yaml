ReleaseNotes: |-
  Features
  - Added batch allow/disable/block in Audit tab.
  - Audit tab now shows any changes (in the status bar).
  - (Beta) Added quarantine mode in Audit tab. This is a more secure feature that disables all added rules unless you accept them. Please open any issue with it on GitHub.
  Backend
  - Wildcard rule tab now shows changes immediately.
  - Made debug log less noisy.
  - Updated Audit to save complete cache of firewall rules.
  - Optimized live connections polling.
  - Added double buffering to the data grids.
  Bugs
  - Scaled rescan/lock icons so they should appear in the same spot if you change monitors with different resolution/dpi.
  - Fixed loading popup in live connections.
  - Fixed ICMP rule creation in advanced window.
  - Fixed column sorting.
  - Fixed audit counter.
  UI
  - Moved all config files to %appdata%. Added button to quickly open the config files in the Settings menu.
  - Changed audit tab to disable rather than delete, with delete in context menu.
  - Audit tab shows signatures and color coding (green for trusted, yellow for third party, red for unsigned). Many red are safe Windows programs like UWP or services that do not have the signature inside the file.
  - Audit tab: added new column for when the program detected the new rule.
  - Added Audit tab status bar.
