ShortDescription: A decentralized and secure messenger app
Description: |-
  Delta Chat is a reliable, decentralized and secure messaging app, available for mobile and desktop platforms.
  Delta Chat feels like Whatsapp or Telegram but you can also use and regard it as an e-mail app. You can signup anonymously to a variety of interoperable chatmail servers which are minimal e-mail servers optimized for fast and secure operations. Or you may use classic e-mail servers and an existing e-mail account in which case Delta Chat acts as an e-mail app.
