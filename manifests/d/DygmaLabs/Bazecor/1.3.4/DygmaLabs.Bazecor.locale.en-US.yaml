ReleaseNotes: |-
  What's new
  - The Defy can now connect to up to 5 different devices via Bluetooth (BT).Â We have designed a new UI on the keyboard that will show you the 5 devices, tell you which are paired, let you swap between them, and even unpair them.
  - Note: when flashing the new firmware, your BT devices will be reset, so you'll need to reconnect them.
  - This pairing UI is activated automatically when you insert the neuron in the back of the Defy, but you can also activate it with the new pairing button.
  - Improved battery readingÂ and battery status.
  - AddedÂ new advanced wireless settings.Â You can now select a different brightness for wireless as well as other battery management options.
  - Fixed a bug where the brightness preferences would reset after making changes to your layout
  - Updated flashing procedureÂ with new instructions and a new user interface that guides you through the process.
    We also fixed a bug where the firmware update process would not start if your top-left key was not ESC.
  - New English UK independent layout.
    Before, you would get English US or UK depending on whether your keyboard was ISO or ANSI, which doesn't work for the Defy ðŸ˜…
  - Improved the keyboard selectionÂ screen while multiple keyboards are connected.
  - Fixed a bug where applying colors to the underglow would leave a segment out.
  - Fixed a bug where F13 and over would not work.
  - Fixed various UI bugs when resizing the screen.
  - Now, we have a Mac ARM native version.
  - We redesigned how the firmware repository works.
    Now, you will only be able to flash the firmware versions that are compatible with your current Bazecor.
