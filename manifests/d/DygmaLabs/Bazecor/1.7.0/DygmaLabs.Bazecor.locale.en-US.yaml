ReleaseNotes: |-
  Hi, Dygmates
  Today, we have a new Bazecor version with a nifty little feature: you can now manually export backups in preferences.
  This is really helpful if you want to save and name a specific configuration. This can be useful before making big changes to your layout or if you want to have a layout for Mac and another for Windows that you can easily load.

  Remember, Bazecor does an automatic backup of your configuration every time you save changes to the keyboard. This makes it easier to save one in particular ðŸ˜Š
  What's New
  - Added a button to export the current backup
  - Renamed the restore backup buttons to make them easier to understand
  - Fixed a bug where long macros would overflow in the preview window of the layout editor
  - Added a better explanation for "Add key on tap" in Advanced Modifiers
  - Removed the mouse movement options on Macros, as it was never supported by the firmware ðŸ˜…
  - Removed the option to add Layer Shift on TAP in a Superkey, as it doesn't make sense
