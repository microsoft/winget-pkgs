ReleaseNotes: |-
  Hi, Dygmates
  This is a quick update to improve the new pop-up to restore your layers after a firmware update.
  We've added a way to exit the pop-up if you encounter any issues restoring your backup. That way, you can reconnect your keyboard and restore the backup manually in preferences.
