ReleaseNotes: |-
  Hello Dygmates!
  We have the new Bazecor version 1.3.10! 🎉 It has numerous improvements that make it more user-friendly and easy to use.
  We also have new firmware version 1.2.6 (beta), but this firmware update only applies to wireless Dygma Defy keyboards.
  IMPORTANT: In case your layers do not get restored after updating the firmware, you can easily restore a backup from the preferences menu.What's changed from 1.3.9:
  - We've improved the color editor. We removed the option to add or remove colors from the color palette. Now, the 16 color options are fixed and visible upon opening Bazecor.
  - We've made many improvements to the Macros feature. The Macro recording now works with all languages that are configured in Bazecor. We removed the mouse movements in the Macro editor as they were not working properly yet. We also fixed the macros memory error that occurred when no memory was available.
  - Superkeys are more super than ever! We made some changes to the capabilities of the Superkey editor. Now modifiers such as CTRL, SHIFT, ALT, etc, are now available for the Superkey TAP action.
  - For the Wireless feature, we've refined the Battery indicators and texts to make them easier to understand.
  - We made improvements to the Layout Editor. The tooltip description for the Battery Level key has been updated. The Media key icons are now consistent in both Standard and Single View.
  - We fixed an annoying bug that occurred when switching from the Color Selection view to the Key Layout view when the Neuron was selected.
  - We've added the Polish layout language on Bazecor. Now you can select among 17 keyboard layout languages.
  - Thanks to our awesome Dygmate @jreklund, we now have a new Keyboard Language tool for Bazecor. For the Devs who want to create new languages, it's now easier than ever to do so! 👏🏻
  - We've also made several refactors and updates that you can find below in the Changelog.
  What's new with the Defy firmware 1.2.6 (beta):
  Update to Bazecor 1.3.10 to get all the new features✨IMPORTANT: The fix in this version only applies to wireless Defy keyboards. If you have a wired Defy, you do not need to update to this firmware. Make sure to toggle the Show Beta firmware in the Advanced settings to see version 1.2.6 (beta).- We fixed a bug where the battery reading was inaccurate and would freeze on Bazecor.
  - Battery levels are now reported in numbers: 100, 85, 70, 60, 50, 40, 30, 20, 15, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2, 1.
  - We fixed the Bluetooth connection of the right half of the keyboard and made it more reliable so it will pair instantly with the left half.
  If you want to check all the new features that came with 1.2.5-beta, check this other release: LINKKnown bugs and issues:
  - Some users have reported that the keyboard can discharge at night if connected to a turned-off computer
  - Some user have reported that the battery doesn't charge when connected to their computer
  - If you have superkeys in the number row, BT pairing doesn't work
  - Overlap threshold preferences don't seem to affect Superkey's behavior
  - Layer Shift on Hold is only available in the single view editor of the Superkeys
  - Layer Shift on Hold for Superkeys always takes you back to Layer 1
  - Various bugs when holding multiple superkeys at the same time
  - The flashing procedure is flaky. It gets stuck or doesn't restore your layers
  - Wake from sleep doesn't always wake up both sides. You need to turn them off and on again.
  - Layer shift might get stuck if you hold a shift to layer multiple consecutive times
  - The keyboard can accidentally switch to BT mode over RF if you perform multiple layer switches consecutively
  - Bluetooth connections reset when you flash a new firmware
  - Various inconsistencies in how macros behave
  - If you add more than 64 macros in the Defy, everything seems to break
  - LED Effects reset to your custom LED after a battery reading
  - There's no way to edit delays in the macro editor
  - The wireless LED settings are hidden and difficult to find
  - Disconnect Timeout error message if you leave Bazecor open too long
  - The "Changes saved" prompt freezes if you move to another window
