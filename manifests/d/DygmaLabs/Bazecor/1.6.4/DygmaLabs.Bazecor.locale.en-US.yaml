ReleaseNotes: |-
  Hi, Dygmates
  This week, we have further bugfixing!
  - Fixed a bug where the release notes button in the preferences menu didn't work
  - Fixed a bug where you could create a macro with more instructions than what is supported by the firmware. You'll now see a Macro Length indicator, and you won't be able to add more characters once you reach 100%
  - Added tests to ensure more bug-free releases thanks to @lbrooks
  What's next
  We've been working on improving Bazecor on Linux, but we're still testing the changes in multiple distros. We'll also continue general bug fixing.
