ReleaseNotes: |-
  Hello, Dygmates
  Today, we have a small Bazecor release with updated dependencies and, most importantly, the ability to flash the new Defy 2.0 and Raise 2 1.2 firmware.
  Before updating the firmware, remember:
  - The new firmware updates the neuron, the keyscanners, and the RF Gateways. If the keyboard stays dark after the process is finished, don’t turn it on and off; let it be for 20-30 seconds.
  - Your layers might not be restored after the update. To recover them, go to Preferences > Backups > Restore from last Backup
  - If the process is stuck for more than 2 or 3 minutes, you can close Bazecor, reconnect the keyboard and start again
  - Updating the firmware will reset your Bluetooth connections; you'll need to forget the keyboard in your System's preferences and pair it again.
  If anything goes wrong, you can manually flash the firmware with the flasher tools as explained here: https://support.dygma.com/hc/en-us/articles/15272957832477-How-to-charge-my-Dygma-keyboard-power-consumption-information
