ReleaseNotes: |-
  New public DNS monitoring website: https://status.dnscrypt.info -- Check it out!
  Version 2.1.15
  - The proxy now dynamically reduces timeouts as the connection limit is approached, improving performance and preventing connection exhaustion under heavy load.
  - Fixed crashes in the configuration file watcher when fsnotify creation fails.
  - DHCP resolver errors ($DHCP forwarding) are now properly logged and visible to system administrators.
  - Fixed double-bracketing of IPv6 addresses in DoH stamps that could prevent proper connection to IPv6 DoH servers.
  - Cache statistics are now more accurate by only counting queries that actually participate in caching.
  - The monitoring UI has been enhanced with server health indicators and improved display of resolver performance metrics.
  - Proxy hostnames (when using SOCKS/HTTP proxies) are now pre-resolved using bootstrap resolvers if they are domain names.
  - Multiple IP addresses per hostname are now cached instead of randomly selecting one, improving connection reliability for multi-homed servers.
