ReleaseNotes: |-
  Version 2.1.8
  - Dependencies have been updated, notably the QUIC implementation, which could be vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks.
  - In forwarding rules, the target can now optionally include a non-standard DNS port number. The port number is also now optional when using IPv6.
  - An annoying log message related to permissions on Windows has been suppressed.
  - Resolver IP addresses can now be refreshed more frequently. Additionally, jitter has been introduced to prevent all resolvers from being refreshed simultaneously. Further changes have been implemented to mitigate issues arising from multiple concurrent attempts to resolve a resolver's IP address.
  - An empty value for "tls_cipher_suite" is now equivalent to leaving the property undefined. Previously, it disabled all TLS cipher suites, which had little practical justification.
  - In forwarding rules, an optional *. prefix is now accepted.
