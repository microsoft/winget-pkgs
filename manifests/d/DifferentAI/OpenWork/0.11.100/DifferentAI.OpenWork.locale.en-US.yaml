ShortDescription: An open-source alternative to Claude Cowork, powered by OpenCode
Description: |-
  OpenWork is an extensible, open-source “Claude Work” style system for knowledge workers.
  It’s a native desktop app that runs OpenCode under the hood, but presents it as a clean, guided workflow:
  - pick a workspace
  - start a run
  - watch progress + plan updates
  - approve permissions when needed
  - reuse what works (templates + skills)
  The goal: make “agentic work” feel like a product, not a terminal.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Highlights
  - Fix a composer regression where long prompts could be overwritten by stale draft echoes, making typed text appear to disappear.
  Fixes & polish
  - Harden draft echo tracking in the session composer with bounded, time-windowed retention instead of a tiny fixed queue.
  - Added a Chrome MCP verification screenshot for long-input behavior in packages/app/pr/screenshots/composer-long-input-no-disappear.png.
  Packaging / ops
  - Bumped app, desktop, orchestrator, server, and router versions to 0.11.100.
  - Updated AUR metadata and lockfiles for the new release.
