ShortDescription: An open-source alternative to Claude Cowork, powered by OpenCode
Description: |-
  OpenWork is an extensible, open-source “Claude Work” style system for knowledge workers.
  It’s a native desktop app that runs OpenCode under the hood, but presents it as a clean, guided workflow:
  - pick a workspace
  - start a run
  - watch progress + plan updates
  - approve permissions when needed
  - reuse what works (templates + skills)
  The goal: make “agentic work” feel like a product, not a terminal.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Highlights
  - Improves desktop startup reliability by allowing more time for openwork-orchestrator to come online while OpenCode runs first-time SQLite migrations.
  Fixes & polish
  - Increases orchestrator health wait timeout in desktop startup flow to prevent false "offline"/connection-refused failures during cold starts.
  - Includes regular patch-version consistency updates across app, desktop, orchestrator, server, and opencode-router packages.
  Packaging / ops
  - Updates release automation to publish opencode-router to npm as part of the release flow.
  - Refreshes AUR packaging metadata.
