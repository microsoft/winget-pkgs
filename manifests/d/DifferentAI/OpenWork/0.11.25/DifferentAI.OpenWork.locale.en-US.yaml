ShortDescription: An open-source alternative to Claude Cowork, powered by OpenCode
Description: |-
  OpenWork is an extensible, open-source “Claude Work” style system for knowledge workers.
  It’s a native desktop app that runs OpenCode under the hood, but presents it as a clean, guided workflow:
  - pick a workspace
  - start a run
  - watch progress + plan updates
  - approve permissions when needed
  - reuse what works (templates + skills)
  The goal: make “agentic work” feel like a product, not a terminal.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Highlights
  - Multi-workspace hosting: OpenWork server now exposes all configured workspaces (GET /workspaces) and supports mounted workspace URLs (/w/:id) calling existing /workspace/:id/* routes safely.
  - Workspace-scoped Tasks sidebar: tasks stay visible across all workspaces (collapsed groups + counts), and "New task" reliably creates the task in the selected workspace.
  - Sharing: local Share prefers a stable workspace URL (.../w/<id>) by resolving the workspace id from the host.
  Chat Access (Owpenbot)
  - Multi-workspace routing via persisted bindings (channel, peerId) -> directory.
  - New /dir <path> command to bind a chat to a directory.
  - Health endpoints for binding management: GET /bindings, POST /bindings.
  Desktop
  - Default local engine runtime is now Openwrk (orchestrator).
