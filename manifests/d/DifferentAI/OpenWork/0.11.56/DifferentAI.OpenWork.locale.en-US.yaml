ShortDescription: An open-source alternative to Claude Cowork, powered by OpenCode
Description: |-
  OpenWork is an extensible, open-source “Claude Work” style system for knowledge workers.
  It’s a native desktop app that runs OpenCode under the hood, but presents it as a clean, guided workflow:
  - pick a workspace
  - start a run
  - watch progress + plan updates
  - approve permissions when needed
  - reuse what works (templates + skills)
  The goal: make “agentic work” feel like a product, not a terminal.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Highlights

  - Expanded server and dashboard wiring to better support workspace-scoped behavior and status updates.
  - Updated identities/settings/message list surfaces to align with the new routing behavior and improve clarity.
  - Included AUR metadata updates and synchronized package versions for the v0.11.56 release.
