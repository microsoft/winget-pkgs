ShortDescription: Tropy is free open-source software that allows you to organize and describe photographs of research material.
Description: |-
  Tropy is free open-source software that allows you to organize and describe photographs of research material.

  Tropy thinks the way you do: like a researcher. Say goodbye to IMG_5261.JPG and IMG_5262.JPG, and say hello to your sources.

  Tropy helps you contextualize artifacts and their photos by capturing your own subject expertise. A friendly editing interface allows customized templates that fit your research like a glove.

  Tropy understands that every researcher is different and that every project has its own demands. Break free from the logic of the physical archive and use tags and lists to organize your research items according to your needs.

  Tropyâ€™s beautiful annotation tools allow you to transcribe documents, select image details, and manipulate photographs to get the clearest view of your sources.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Added the new standard project type. With this, all photos imported into your project are copied into the project folder. This project folder can be moved around freely or shared with other devices without having to consolidate photos.
  - The old project type is still available as an advanced project. With advanced projects, no extra copies of imported photos are made and you have full control over where photos are stored and how they are referenced by the project.
  - Moved new project form into project window.
  - Added list of recent projects to new project form.
  - Existing projects can be converted to the new standard project type in the project settings.
  - Project files will now be optimized routinely. For large projects files this means that there could be a significant delay the first time you open and close the project after upgrading to this version (in particular for project database files with 50 MB or more).
  - The Notepad component was completely re-written, fixing various issues, in particular relating to composite input methods.
  - Sanitize JPEG comments during import. Only valid text comments will be saved as photo metadata.
  - Updated to libvips 8.14 (and updated all dependent libraries).
  - Updated to Electron 23.
  - Fixed PNG import for files with a lot of embedded metadata fields.
  - Added ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· Brazilian Portuguese translations.
