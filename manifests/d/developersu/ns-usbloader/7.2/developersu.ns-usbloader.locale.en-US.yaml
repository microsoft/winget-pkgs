  p.s.
  I'm going to update building pipelines once find time. Add '.dmg' packaging for macOS and change CI to create rolling pre-releases like some folks are doing.. So you will not have to search the latest nightly build. Latest binaries would be creating per each commit (change in code). Thanks =)
