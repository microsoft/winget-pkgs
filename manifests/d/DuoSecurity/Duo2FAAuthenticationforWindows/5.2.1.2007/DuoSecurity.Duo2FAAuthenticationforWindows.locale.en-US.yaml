ShortDescription: Add two-factor authentication to Remote Desktop and local logons and credentialed UAC elevation prompts.
Description: |-
  Duo Authentication for Windows Logon adds Duo two-factor authentication to these Windows and Windows Server logon scenarios:
  - Local or domain account logins
  - Logins at the local console and/or incoming Remote Desktop (RDP) connections
  - Credentialed User Access Control (UAC) elevation requests (e.g. Right-click + "Run as administrator") in v4.1.0 and later
  Duo's Windows Logon client does not add a secondary authentication prompt to the following logon types:
  - Shift + right-click "Run as different user"
  - PowerShell "Enter-PSSession" or "Invoke-Command" cmdlets
  - Non-interactive logons (i.e. Log on as a Service, Log on as Batch, Scheduled Tasks, drive mappings, etc.)
  - Pre-Logon Access Providers (PLAPs) such as Windows Always On VPN
  - RDP Restricted Admin Mode
ReleaseNotes: |-
  This release corrects the silent install issue present in 5.2.0.
  - Corrects an issue where enrollments for offline access and passwordless OS logon were not persisted on upgrade via silent install.
  - Corrects an issue where custom registry keys (such as ProvidersWhitelist) may not have persisted on upgrade via silent install.
  - Corrects an issue where the GUI installer may not have deleted registry export files after completing installation.
  - The ARM64 installer now supports a specified value for EnableCertPinning during silent install.
