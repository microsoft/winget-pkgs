  The Big Ones
  The following is a summary of the main features added to darktable
  5.2. Please see the user manual for more details of the individual
  changes (where available).
  - N/A
  UI/UX Improvements
  - Reset window position if it can't be placed at last used position on
    any available monitor in a multi-monitor setup.
  Performance Improvements
  - N/A
  Other Changes
  - Add busy cursor while generating a GPX track preview and a progress
    bar while applying positions from a track to images.
  Bug Fixes
  - Fixed translation of snapshot module's labels.
  - Expanded width of preference boxes Lua Options so that long input is visible.
  - Fixed compilation when OpenMP is disabled.
  - Fixed an OpenCL bug in rastermask module for non-raw images.
  - Fixed regression introduced in darktable 5.0 with inability to read
    raw files from ancient (over two decades old) Canon cameras that
    recorded raw files with .tiff extension.
  - Fixed the inability of external raster masks module to work in
    Windows with PFM files that have Unicode characters in the file
    name.
  - Fixed a bug in liquify OpenCL code leading to incorrect clamped
    output.
  - Fix color equalizer picker not working in quick access panel.
  - Paletted TIFFs were read incorrectly by the main libtiff-based
    loader, with loss of color information. We are now handing them over
    to the GraphicsMagick/ImageMagick fallback loader (usually available
    in official/distro builds) for correct reading.
  - The variable names for the metadata tags variables have been changed
    to the full case sensitive tag name to avoid ambiguity.
  - Fixed inability to remove collections with ' in the name.

    metadata fields unless the user selects all of the checkboxes in the
    export module's preference options.
