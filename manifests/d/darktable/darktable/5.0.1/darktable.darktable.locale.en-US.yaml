ReleaseNotes: |-
  We're proud to announce the new bug-fix release of darktable, 5.0.1!
  The github release is here: https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/releases/tag/release-5.0.1.
  To build from source, do not use the autogenerated tarball provided by GitHub on the release page, download our tar.xz file instead. If you're just building for yourself without creating a package for some distribution, then using source code cloning in git is an even more convenient way.
  The checksums are:

  The Big Ones
  The following is a summary of the main features added to Darktable
  5.0.1. Please see the user manual for more details of the individual
  changes (where available).
  - N/A
  UI/UX Improvements
  - N/A
  Performance Improvements
  - Improved performance of discarding history of selected images.
  Other Changes
  - Harmonized style selection in print settings with the update made in
    the export module for release 5.0.
  - Darktable now includes the Lensfun database into the AppImage.
  - Center collapsible module section labels.
  Bug Fixes
  - Fixed a scrolling bug in the collections module where the collection
    tree was not scrolled to the previous position when returning from
    darkroom.
  - Fix crash when attempting to move up the top or only shape in a
    group in the mask manager.
  - Fix collection module when using the "module" filter which was
    listing none of the processing modules.
  - Fix iop-order user presets use. It was not possible to get a user's
    iop-order preset to be applied as the Darktable internal presets
    where always picked up first.
  - Fixed a crash in variable expansion for $(SEQUENCE[n,m]).
  - Fixed handling on click from filmstrip when in map and print
    view. On map we now properly center the image on the map. On the
    print view, we use the selected image as content of the main print
    area.
  - Fixed a regression introduced in 5.0.0 where we lost the ability to
    read 2-channel TIFF files and files with more than 4 channels. This
    fix allows them to be read by the TIFF loader, whereas previously
    the TIFF loader rejected such files and they were loaded by a
    fallback loader (GraphicsMagick or ImageMagick).
  - Fixed not being able to pan with a mouse in the zoomable layout.
  - Fixed possibly collapsing the module header when restoring defaults.
  - Fixed a case of XMP being written without actual image modification.
  - Fixed a crash of Darktable when reimporting XMP having overlay
    images referenced.
  - Fixed the support for single lib module opened at a time when in
    darkroom.
  - Fixed xmp sidecar writing while working as a gimp plugin.
  - Fixed issues when applying a style in darkroom using the Styles
    module.
  - Fixed a possible crash when using Ctrl+z reproduced on
    macOS.
  - Fixed Darktable crashing in enlarge-canvas module.
  - Fixed Darktable crashing using details mask due to bad tiling.
  - Fixed a hash calculation bug leading to pixelpipe instabilities.
  - Fixed issue to handle auto-presets when the focal length is greater
    then 1000.
  - Fixed crash on macOS when closing the darkroom's second window.
  - Fixed possible jump in filmstrip when entering darkroom from full
    preview.
  - Fixed a performance regression in haze removal module.
  - Fixed reading palette-based PNG with transparency.
  - Fixed possible crash in lens correction module when changing camera
    and/or lens model.
  - Fixed crash after deleting style or preset that was selected in
    shortcuts dialog.
  - Fixed a crash when the currently active module instance is being
    deleted.
  - We now support the correct orientation for JPEG XL if it was
    specified in the format's metadata but not in Exif (or Exif is
    missing). We also avoid over-transformation if it is specified in
    both the basic data and Exif.
  Lua
  API Version
  - API version is now 9.4.0
  New Features
  - N/A
  Bug Fixes
  - N/A
  Add action support for Lua
  Other Lua changes
  - N/A
  Notes
  - The AppImage package is compatible with distribution releases that
    have glibc version 2.35 or higher. For example, if we consider some
    popular distributions, Ubuntu 22.04, Debian 12, Fedora 36 and newer
    releases are compatible.
  - The macOS *-x86_64.dmg and *-arm64-13.5.dmg packages require at
    least macOS 13.5 (Ventura), the *-arm64.dmg package requires at
    least macOS 14.0 (Sonoma).
  - When exporting to AVIF, EXR, JPEG XL, or XCF, selecting specific
    metadata (e.g. geo-tag or creator) is not currently possible. For
    AVIF, EXR, JPEG XL, and XCF formats, Darktable will not include any
    metadata fields unless the user selects all of the checkboxes in the
    export module's preference options.
