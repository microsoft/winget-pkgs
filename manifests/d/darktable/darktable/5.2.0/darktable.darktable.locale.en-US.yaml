ReleaseNotes: |-
  We're proud to announce the new feature release of darktable, 5.2.0!
  The github release is here: https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/releases/tag/release-5.2.0.
  To build from source, do not use the autogenerated tarball provided by GitHub on the release page, download our tar.xz file instead. If you're just building for yourself without creating a package for some distribution, then using source code cloning in git is an even more convenient way.

  The Big Ones
  The following is a summary of the main features added to darktable
  5.2. Please see the user manual for more details of the individual
  changes (where available).
  - View snapshots side-by-side with the current image, instead of as a
    partial overlay, by clicking the button next to "take snapshot". The
    center viewport is divided in two equal panels and can be zoomed and
    panned (by dragging while holding the "a" key) as before. The
    dividing line can not be moved and any click without "a" rotates the
    layout.
  - The metadata module is now fully configurable and allows to add and
    maintain any tags which are supported by exiv2.
  - Added a new module "raster mask import". After setting up a root
    folder containing PFM files, a file can be selected to be used as a
    raster mask, it is scaled to full image size. You can also define
    what combination of the RGB channels of that PFM file will be used
    for the raster mask.
  - Sigmoid module is now the default tone-mapper selected for new
    installation.
  - The export module has got a new section multi-preset export which
    allows to export the selected images with multiple presets in one
    single export run.
  UI/UX Improvements
  - Replaced the zoom range widget, which controls the number of
    thumbnails displayed on the thumbnail table, with a spin
    button. This makes it easier to set the exact value.
  - In the 4 ways tab in Color Balance RGB, ctrl+click now
    picks the actual color while regular click continues to pick the
    opposite color. This gives users more flexibility and control when
    selecting hues.
  Performance Improvements
  - Eliminated unnecessary GUI refreshes.
  - Improved user interface responsiveness for blending operations.
  Other Changes
  - Removed the levels and contrast brightness saturation modules (which
    were deprecated in 2023) from the deprecated modules group. Since
    this group would be empty after that, it has also been removed for
    now.
  - Due to an upstream issue, exporting JPEG XL in 16-bit float at
    quality 100 is not currently mathematically lossless.
  - Allow reading of files in Cineon format (developed by Kodak) and DPX
    format (developed by SMPTE) with .cin and .dpx file extensions.
  - The "prefer performance over quality" preference setting has been
    removed.
  - A workaround for old broken AMD OpenCL drivers that has been in
    place for 12 years has been disabled by default. Hopefully more
    recent drivers don't need it anymore and it caused problems with the
    translation of the user interface during startup, causing part of it
    to appear in English. If you have problems with OpenCL that you
    believe may be caused by this change, please do two things:
    - Add the line opencl_force_c_locale=anything to your
      ~/.config/darktable/darktablerc file.
    - If that solves your problem, please report the issue to GiHhub
      PR #18342, including information on the make of your GPU and the
      version of your drivers. We can then for the next release either
      by default re-enable the workaround for drivers that need them,
      or warn people with antiquated drivers that they need to update.
  - Presets can now be arranged in sub menus, like styles can, by
    inserting | in their name between levels. The shortcuts
    dialog/preferences tab now show these collapsible hierarchies for
    styles and presets too (and the bug that style shortcuts were not
    translated is fixed).
  - Give a hint for pending background work when darktable is closing.
  - Improved rendering output of Denoise Profile, Dither and Astrophoto
    Denoise on second window or in high quality processing mode.
  - Hide "reduce resolution of preview image" preference setting. This
    was a way to get better responsiveness on slow systems introduced in
    2020, but at the same time it was making the color picker and mask
    support inaccurate (quality loss).
  - Improved quality of inpaint opposed highlight recovery algorithm for
    sRAW images.
  - Reduced haze removal visible difference between exports and HQ
    darkroom processing.
    For some images the algorithm fails to calculate correction
    parameters, this is reported via control log.
  - Lens info is now read from OM-System/Olympus image files taken with
    lenses without electronic data if this info is entered in the
    camera lens info settings dialog. The lens correction module will
    automatically find the lens, if it is supported by lensfun and the
    entered name matches the lensfun name, which can be seen in the lens
    selection drop down list.
  - Raster masks got internal improvements and now support the same refinement
    tools as all other masks including details threshold, feathering guide and
    radius, blurring radius and contrast. Some UI refinements for raster-masks.
  - The highlights module offers a raster mask with information about level above
    clip level.
  - Changing orientation (via the flip module) respects changes done in
    crop module.
  - The shown dimension while cropping now matches the default export
    dimension and keeps the exact chosen ratio.
  - In the history module item tooltip, fixed the formatting and scaling
    of the changes to match the values as seen in the modules
    themselves.
  - Added auto login to the piwigo export module. This can be enabled in
    the security section of the preferences.
  - Add 45x35 aspect ratio to the crop module, which is popular on IDs
    and passports.
  - Color assessment conditions: Changed total border width to relative
    scaling which should work well on small and big screens, independent
    of physical screen resolution, added pop-up window for
    parameterization and removed ISO12464 reference.
  - Improved visibility of masks in darkroom. This is controlled by the
    new hidden "darkroom/ui/develop_mask_mix" configuration option.
  - Add a new setting to change which images are taken into account for
    actions: By default, the image under the cursor takes priority. With
    this parameter enabled, the selected images will take priority, and
    the image under the cursor will only be taken into account to feed
    the information modules.
  - Added a tag icon on thumbnails to display the list of attached tags
    when hovering over it.
  - In the map view, it is possible to pan the entire track in one of
    the following ways: by double-clicking on the track segment list, by
    left-clicking on the list header, or by shortcut option.
  Bug Fixes
  - Fixed sidecar writing if quitting from darkroom.
  - Fixed some rare race conditions while processing the pixelpipes.
  - Fixed collection filter presets based on capture time creating an
    empty widget.
  - Proper high quality demosaicing and details blending support for
    second window.
  - Fixed a bug that allowed NULL pointer dereference in tethering mode
    under certain conditions, which resulted in a crash.
  - Fixed darktable shutdown code so pending background jobs are properly finished
    and give a control log if there is pending work.
  - Fixed a crash in the import dialog when trying to add a new place to
    an empty places list.
  - Fixed bit-depth setting not saved in AVIF export presets.
  - Fixed reset button not working in the geotagging module. Also a
    loaded GPX track in the geotagging module is now properly removed.
  - Fixed darktable-cli crashing if the darktable database is locked.
  - Fixed image not properly layout in the print module after being
    rotated from Lighttable.
  - Fixed a bug where the changes in various edit fields are not saved
    correctly when the field loses the input focus.
  - Fixed incorrect reporting of whether a flash was fired in expansion
    variables $(EXIF.FLASH.ICON) and $(EXIF.FLASH) under certain
    conditions.
  - Fixed the edit style dialog to show all module's duplicates. Also,
    when creating a new style we don't show the whole history but only
    the last version of each module.
  - Fixed a bug in xtrans demosaicers that could feed NaNs into the
    pixelpipe.
