ShortDescription: Clipboard manager with advanced features
Tags:
- clipboard
- tray
ReleaseNotes: |-
  Added
  - Allows processing all clipboard changes (#2787, #2746).
  If clipboard contains secret (for example, copied from a password manager),
  onSecretClipboardChanged() script function is called with data containing
  mimeSecret format set to 1. Also ensures that callbacks are called
  consistently for all clipboard changes with properly set formats
  mimeClipboardMode, mimeOutputTab and mimeCurrentTab.
  Fixed
  - Fixes editing multiple items (#2810).
  - Fixes synchronization plugin causing redundant UI updates and menu
  misbehavior (#2649).
  - Fixes showing sub-menus for custom commands in tray menu (#2730).
  - Fixes switching tab if onItemsLoaded() is overridden (#2788).
  - Fixes theme option hover_item_css (#2687).
  - Avoids modifying data from display commands and causing redundant UI updates
  (#2837).
  - Avoids sharing execute() state in case it is launched recursively.
