ReleaseNotes: |-
  Added
  - Wayland: Global shortcuts are now registered using Portal if available.
  - Black theme (#3142). Thanks to @FadeMind.
  - Adds attributes for controlling the dialog window created via dialog()
    (#2947): .onTop makes the dialog stay on top of other windows, .modal
    makes the dialog modal (blocks interaction with other windows in the
    application until closed).
  - Adds support showing icon font symbol in notes using
    application/x-copyq-item-icon format.
  - Adds support for setting colors in theme files by name. For example:
    edit_bg=white.
  Changed
  - Temporary tabs that are not stored on disk will now not expire if
    configuration changes (#3172).
  - Pinned and locked items will not be dropped if tab size (maximum item count)
    changes (#3008).
  - The app now propagates exit code properly if it is aborted or receives a
    Unix signal (SIGINT, SIGTERM).
  - Support for Qt older than 5.15 has been dropped.
  - The build now uses Qt 6 by default. Use cmake -DWITH_QT6=OFF ... to build
    the app for Qt 5.
  - Windows: The application will be now hidden from screenshots and screen
    recordings by default (#3165). This can be disabled using option "Hide from
    screenshots and recordings".
  - Logs are now stored in multiple files based on the process and the log
    records have a slightly different format (start with timestamp).
  Fixes
  - Drops unsafe sanitizing QTextDocument fonts (#3156). Qt 6 should handle any
    rich texts safely now.
  - Logging now does not use lock files and avoids crashes if the application
    loop was not yet started.
  - Avoids resetting properties of a tab if it is renamed.
  - Fixes setting color for item counter (#2717).
  - Fixes editing and providing UTF-8 text by default (#3093).
  - Fixes updating item preview if when window is shown.
  - Fixes changing synchronization directory for a tab.
  - Fixes possible crash if calling a function with unexpected function argument.
  - Fixes background of the command line in some themes in FakeVim plugin.
  - Fixes renaming tabs with item storing disabled.
  - Avoids collapsing tab in the tab tree after it is moved.
  - Fixes item counter value after moving the tab in the tab tree.
  - Fixes moving tab group with items in the tab tree.
  - Linux: Fixes storing the first clipboard change after starting the app and
    modifying configuration.
  - Linux: Avoids exiting on commit data request from the session manager (#3145).
