ShortDescription: Clipboard manager with advanced features
Tags:
- clipboard
- tray
ReleaseNotes: |-
  Added
  - Emacs navigation key-bindings support.
  - Adds support for setting urgency and persistency to notifications. Script
    function notification() takes new arguments: '.urgency' (low, normal, high,
    critical), '.persistent' (toggle persistent notification)
  Changed
  - Updates icon font from Font-Awesome 6.7.2.
  - On Windows, the main window is shown when starting the application using
    the program icon (#2965).
  - Calling exit() script function prints "Terminating server" on stderr
    instead of stdout.
  Fixed
  - Fixes item selection with Ctrl+Space (#2850).
  - Fixes confirming exit if any commands are running.
  - Fixes selecting specific row on search (#2770).
  - Clipboard data cloning will be now aborted if the data changes during the
    process. This avoids using incomplete data in rare cases.
  - Fixes contrast of the selected row number color (#2887). The row number text
    color of selected item is set to the same color as item text by default. This
    can be overridden via "Edit Theme" button using option num_sel_fg.
  - Fixes internal editor syntax highlighting for numbers containing separators
    (for example 100_000, 0x1234_abcd) and avoids incorrectly highlighting
    multiple lines as regular expression in some cases.
  - On GNOME (Wayland session), the clipboard monitor and provider processes run
    in XWayland mode because GNOME does not support Wayland data control
    protocol. This behavior can be skipped by settings QT_QPA_PLATFORM
    environment variable to "wayland" (or other value).
  - On Wayland compositors, fixes unnecessary application start delay if
    clipboard access (the data control protocol) is not supported.
  - On Linux, the "Ignore items with no or single character" predefined command
    properly avoids synchronizing empty text or single character.
  - On Linux, fixes waiting on keyboard modifiers release when synchronizing
    selection.
  - Avoids recursive item preview updates when using display commands.
  - Avoids removing items if drag'n'drop action fails.
  - Wayland: Fixes crash if getting owned clipboard data.
  - Wayland: Fixes setting UTF-8 text on broken GNOME's XWayland.
