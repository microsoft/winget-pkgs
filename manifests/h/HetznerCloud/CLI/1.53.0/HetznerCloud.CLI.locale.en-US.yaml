ReleaseNotes: |-
  Server Types now depend on Locations.
  - We added a new locations property to the Server Types resource. The new property defines a list of supported Locations and additional per Locations details such as deprecations information.
  - We deprecated the deprecation property from the Server Types resource. The property will gradually be phased out as per Locations deprecations are being announced. Please use the new per Locations deprecation information instead.
  See our changelog for more details.
  Features
  - add category property to server type (#1150)
  - per location server types (#1166)
