  API Changes for Traffic Prices and Server Type Included Traffic
  There will be a breaking change in the API regarding Traffic Prices and Server Type Included Traffic on 2024-08-05. This release implements the necessary changes for the CLI.
  Until now, the hcloud server-type list command had a column traffic. This is no longer possible, because there is no single included traffic for a server type, and instead this depends on the location. We have set the field to - and removed it from the default columns. The information is still available in hcloud server-type describe <server-type-name>, now in the "Pricing" section of the output.
  This also affects the JSON and YAML output of both hcloud server-type list and hcloud server-type describe as we use the API schema for this.
  You can learn more about this change in our changelog.

  Features
  - load-balancer-type: show traffic details for each location in describe output (5c9380c)
  - server-type: show traffic details for each location in describe output (5c9380c)
