Description: |-
  Conveyor makes distributing desktop and command line apps as easy as shipping a web app.
  It's a tool not a service, it generates self-upgrading packages for Windows, macOS and Linux using each platform's native package formats without requiring you to have those operating systems.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  New features
  - The app.site.extra-header-html key lets you inject arbitrary HTML into the <head> area of the generated download page.
  - Windows icons are now "unplated" (without a border) by default.
    This overrides the default Windows taskbar icon styling, but brings packaged apps into visual alignment with Microsoft's first party apps.
  - P7B format certificates are now supported.
  - Certificate validity periods are now checked before use.
  - Electron apps are now supported on Linux.

  New features for JVM apps
  - When conveyor.compatibility-level >= 4 any native libraries placed in the app inputs will be moved to the right locations in the generated package to be loaded.
    Native libraries found in JARs were already being extracted and placed there - this just lets you do the same thing for libraries outside of JARs.
  - Fixed: the Azul JDK for Mac didn't work when combined with JMODs.
