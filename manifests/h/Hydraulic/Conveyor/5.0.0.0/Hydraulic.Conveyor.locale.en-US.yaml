Description: |-
  Conveyor makes distributing desktop and command line apps as easy as shipping a web app.
  It's a tool not a service, it generates self-upgrading packages for Windows, macOS and Linux using each platform's native package formats without requiring you to have those operating systems.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  New features
  - Updates can now be set to aggressive mode, meaning the packaged app will check for an update on every launch.
    You can use this to easily keep clients up to date with server protocol changes, without needing to think about backwards compatibility.
  - The new app.site.copy-to key lets you define a location to upload the resulting site via SFTP using the make copied-site task.
  - The new app.url-schemes key lets you associate your app with protocol schemes (my-app://deep/link).
  - The new app.mac.bundle-extras{,.amd64,.aarch64} keys allow you to add extra files anywhere in your Mac bundle even for non-native apps.
  - The app.site.base-url key is now set to GitHub Releases automatically when app.vcs-url points to an HTTPS GitHub repository URL.
  - The new http-headers sub-key of input objects can be used to pass authentication tokens or other arbitrary secrets as part of the download.
    This is useful for fetching artifacts from CI systems.
  - The extract key of an input object can now be the number of wrapped archives to extract.
    This is useful when you need to use files from the output of a GitHub Actions step whilst preserving UNIX permissions, as GitHub Actions always zips the results yet doesn't preserve UNIX metadata, requiring you to wrap the files in a tarball and that is then placed inside a zip.
  Electron
  - The Electron default configuration has been improved with more macOS specific customizations.
  - The top level package-lock {} object has been renamed to package-json {}, with the old name remaining recognized for backwards compatibility purposes.
  JVM
  - JVM options will now have the token <libpath> replaced with the path where shared libraries are deposited.
    This is the same value as found in the java.library.path list, but you can use this token in any system property.
    It's useful for libraries that don't follow the best practice of calling System.loadLibrary first before attempting to unpack a JNI library from their JAR.
  - The config syntax for system properties is now more do-what-i-mean: you don't have to quote property names anymore to stop them being interpreted as JSON object keys.
  - The client enhancements config now has a FlatLAF system property to make it load the native libraries from the right location.
  - The JDK configs have been refreshed.
  Other
  - JAR library extraction now properly recognizes and discards shared libraries built for Android and GNU-toolchain built Solaris.
  - The default for macOS has been changed to pop up an update dialog on the first update, rather than silently install in the background.
    The dialog offers to apply updates silently from that point onwards.
  - Bugfix: bumping the revision will trigger updates on macOS.
  Documentation
  - A new troubleshooting section has been added.
