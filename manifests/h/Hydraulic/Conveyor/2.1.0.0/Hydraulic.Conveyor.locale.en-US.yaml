Description: |-
  Conveyor makes distributing desktop and command line apps as easy as shipping a web app.
  It's a tool not a service, it generates self-upgrading packages for Windows, macOS and Linux using each platform's native package formats without requiring you to have those operating systems.

  Fixes and smaller improvements
  - The minimum macOS version for generated apps was lowered to 10.14 (Mojave). Minimum OS verson requirements are now documented.
  - A guidebook section with comparisons to alternative tools was added.
  - Fixed: packaged apps were incompatible with macOS Catalina. Thanks to Apple for assisting with debugging this.
  - Fixed: the generated certificate signing requests can now be re-exported if you deleted them whilst also having a passphrase on your key.
  For JVM apps
  - The app.jvm.extract-native-libraries key was added to control JAR stripping.
  - The JDK definitions were refreshed.
  - Fixed: jdeps is no longer run if it's not actually being requested via the detect token.
  - Fixed: the jdk.accessibility module is now always included if AWT/Swing are. If this isn't done then apps might crash at startup if screen readers are installed.
