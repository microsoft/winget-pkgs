Description: |-
  Conveyor makes distributing desktop and command line apps as easy as shipping a web app.
  It's a tool not a service, it generates self-upgrading packages for Windows, macOS and Linux using each platform's native package formats without requiring you to have those operating systems.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Bugfixes:
  - Important: Fix a non-determinism in generation of self-signing certificates that would cause upgrade failures for self-signed apps re-built after January 1st 2023.
  - Resolved an issue with using HSM drivers on macOS.
  - Enforce that the app.fsname key is written in kebab-case, as this name is transformed into different casing styles for different platforms to match native conventions and thus kebab-case was as previously undocumented assumption.
  - Fix a crash that could occur if the Mac finder placed .DS_Store files inside the private disk cache area.
  - Improved documentation around how to fix missing app icons on Linux.
