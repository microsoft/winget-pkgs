Description: |-
  Conveyor makes distributing desktop and command line apps as easy as shipping a web app.
  It's a tool not a service, it generates self-upgrading packages for Windows, macOS and Linux using each platform's native package formats without requiring you to have those operating systems.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  - To improve compatibility with Amazon S3/CloudFront, the way Debian packages are placed in the generated apt site has been changed.
    The new default "non-flat" layout places the apt and .deb files into a debian subdirectory.
    The previous "flat" layout (where all the files are together in the same directory) continues to be used for projects that have already uploaded a flat site, or for projects targeting GitHub Releases, as GitHub doesn't allow uploads of files in directories.
    The type of site can be controlled with the new app.site.flat key.
  - Updated JVM template apps to Gradle plugin 1.3, and refreshed the JDK standard library.
  - Bugfix: improved UNIX flavor detection for native libraries in JAR files.
  - Bugfix: fixed an issue with restarting the app after a forced update on Windows if the application name has a space in it.
  - Bugfix: ensure that app.version is always interpreted as a string even if unquoted in HOCON.
