Description: |-
  Conveyor makes distributing desktop and command line apps as easy as shipping a web app.
  It's a tool not a service, it generates self-upgrading packages for Windows, macOS and Linux using each platform's native package formats without requiring you to have those operating systems.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  New features
  - A significantly re-organized tutorial which shows how to adapt existing apps earlier and more explicitly.
  - The app.windows.start-on-login key, which ensures your application will be started automatically when the user logs in without any need for user interaction.
  New features for JVM apps
  - A better Gradle plugin which:
    - Supports Jetpack Compose 1.2
    - Automatically imports the JDK from the selected Java toolchain when possible. This simplifies configuration further and eliminates duplicate configuration.
  - The template apps were cleaned up. The Compose Desktop template app now uses Compose 1.2 (beta).
  - If JDK inputs don't have a jmods directory, the JDK is bundled into the app as-is without using jlink. This helps with packaging apps using GraalVM.
  - JDK standard library was refreshed.
  Smaller improvements
  - Input objects now have an extract property which controls the default behavior of extracting zips and tarballs as they're copied into the package.
  - Config under the top level temp key is dropped before conveyor json renders, allowing you to keep config clean by placing keys there that are only meant to be concatenated into other keys.
  - Fixed: tarballs/zips that contain a Mac bundle no longer trigger the single-root-directory detection.
  - Fixed: errors during EXE enhancement are no longer fatal.
