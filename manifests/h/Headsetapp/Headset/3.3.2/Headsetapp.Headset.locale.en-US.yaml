ShortDescription: Headset is a desktop music player powered by YouTube and Reddit
Description: |-
  Headset is a simple music player for Mac, Windows and Linux with integrated YouTube search, a home screen with popularity list by genres and eras, and best of all, a radio powered by Reddit.
  Headset takes the songs that are shared in over 80 music subreddits, categorizes them and plays them automatically.
  It is a great and pretty unique way to find new music as it is chosen by other humans like you and not by algorithms.
