ReleaseNotes: "Updated outdated gadgets. Add Drives Meter gadget back and update its graphics. One of the older clock skins is added back to the clock gadget. Clipboarder can now override Win+C on updated Win11 24H2 again (this was quite tough to implement). Digital Clock: Fix shadow setting resetting after restart. Fix gadgets incorrectly repositioning after changing certain system configurations. Fix some gadgets not working when the sidebar.exe process is started elevated. 7 Sidebar: Fix gadgets not properly aligning in some configurations. Fix some issues with fullscreen applications and gadgets not properly hiding/showing. Fix an issue with previews gaining always on top properties. Fix an issue which caused preview windows to appear for windows that don't appear on the taskbar. The previous version introduced some bugs: Pressing Win+G was activating gadgets instead of the game bar even when not configured that way in some circumstances. The sidebar.exe process was started with lower priority on startup when autostart is enabled. Those are fixed now."
