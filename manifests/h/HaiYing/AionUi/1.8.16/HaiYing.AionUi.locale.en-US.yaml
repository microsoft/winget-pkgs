  ✨ New Features
  Universal Built-in Model Switching for All CLI Backends
  All supported CLI backends (Claude Code, Qwen Code, Codex, CodeBuddy, Goose, Auggie, Kimi, OpenCode, Factory Droid, GitHub Copilot, Qoder, Mistral Vibe, OpenClaw, Nano Bot, and Custom Agents) now support switching between their built-in models directly from the AionUi interface. This unified feature uses the ACP session/set_model protocol, allowing you to switch models in real-time during active conversations without restarting the CLI.
  Key Features:
  - Switch models seamlessly across all CLI backends using a consistent interface
  - Real-time model switching during active conversations
  - Model pre-selection before starting new conversations
  - Automatic preference saving and restoration for each CLI backend
