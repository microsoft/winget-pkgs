  What's New
  üåê WebUI Mode - Access AionUi from Anywhere
  - Remote Control Your AI Assistant - Now you can access AionUi from any device on your network! Whether you're on your phone, tablet, or another computer, just open a web browser and connect to your AionUi instance running on your main machine.
  - Secure Login Required - Your AI conversations and data are protected with user authentication. You'll need to create a login account and password to access WebUI mode, ensuring only authorized users can use your AI assistant.
  - Works on Servers Too - Perfect for running AionUi on Linux servers without a desktop environment. Your AI assistant can now run 24/7 on your server and you can access it remotely from anywhere.
  - Smart Network Detection - The system automatically detects and displays the best network address for you to connect. On servers, it shows your public IP; on local machines, it shows your local network address.
  - Your Data Stays Safe - All your conversations, settings, and configurations are securely stored locally using SQLite database. Your data never leaves your machine unless you choose to share it.
