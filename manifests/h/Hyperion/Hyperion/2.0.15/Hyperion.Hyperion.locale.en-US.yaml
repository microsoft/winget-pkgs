ReleaseNotes: |-
  Hyperion's February release provides you with the latest updates and fixes.
  Key new features: You can now stream to a dedicated WLED segment, put Hyperion in Suspend or Idle mode or apply dominant color rather than mean color processing.
  Many thanks to @EliteScientist who contributed with an audio grabber which works as the other existing grabbers,
  i.e. you can use the input feeding multiple instances in parallel or forward the input.
  Added
  - Audio Grabber to add audio visualization support for both Windows and Linux.
  - Support streaming to individual WLED segments (requires WLED 0.13.3+).
    To allow segment streaming, enable "Realtime - Use main segment only" in WLED's Sync Interfaces setup screen
  - Allow to keep WLED powered on after streaming and restoring state
  - Allow to Disable / Enable all instances (#970) by
    - Suspend/Resume support for Linux and Windows (#1493,#1282, #978).
      Suspend/Resume/Restart is supported via API, UI, Systray and hyperion-remote
    - Idle scenario via Screen Locking (Linux/Windows), Screensaver invokation (Linux), hyperion-remote or API
      In Idle, all instances, components will be disabled besides the output processing (LED-Devices, smoothing).
      The current priorities will be cleared and the background effect per instance will be executed, if enabled.
    - Commands toogleSuspend and toggleIdle allow to flip between modes, e.g. might be used to trigger modes by a remote
  - Reduced pixel processing to reduce resources on big assignment areas
  - Support for squared mean color processing
  - Support for dominant color processing on assigned LED areas (#1382). A simple and advanced way is provided. Advanced and high accuracy might be combined with reduced pixel processing to lower CPU usage.
  - Add instance# in API response (#1504)
  Changed
  - Renamed LED area assignment naming to provide clarity on the processing algorithms
  - REST API: Increased default timeout to address "Operation cancelled" errors
  - LED Devices: Allow to differentiate between recoverable/unrecoverable errors
  Fixed
  - Effects/Smoothing: Effects with dedicated smoothing settings will now run with those settings (even if general smoothing is off)
  - No interim color update at WLED after streaming and turning off WLED
  - LED-Matrix Layout: Add Cabling direction selection element again (#1566)
  - Restart correctly, if running as service (#1368)
  - Hue-Wizard: In case auto discovery failed, port 80 was not used as default (#1544)
  - Send only one reply per Start Instance request (#1551)
  - Add instance# in JSON-API replies (aligning to Add instance in websocket response to a subscription #1504 behaviour)
  - hyperion-remote: Extracting reply for a configGet request correctly (#1555)
  - Grabber fps setting was not applied correctly
  - Smoothing: No empty updates
  Technical
  - Add CodeQL for GitHub code scanning
  - Update to Protocol Buffers 3.21.12
  - Update to Mbed TLS 3.3.0
  - Qt6 alignments
  - cmake support of libcec without version in lib-name
  - Refactor for Python 3.11 deprecated functions
