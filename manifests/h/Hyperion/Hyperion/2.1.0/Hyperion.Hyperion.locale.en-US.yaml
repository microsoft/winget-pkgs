ReleaseNotes: |-
  üåø Hyperion goes green!
  Resource consumption during builds has been drastically reduced behind the scenes by streamlining processes and encouraging reuse.
  This release also involves significant refactoring of the core elements of the platform and the API.
  This version comes with many bug fixes and a number of long-awaited new features and improvements.
  You can download the executables from GitHub or even better via our official repositories for Debian, Ubuntu and Fedora.
  Installation and update instructions can be found on the comprehensive instructions page. Just select the method you would like to use.
  Change details
  ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes
  - Rename "-v" & "--verbose" options to "-i" & "--info to not overlap with version information
  JSON-API
  - Standardized subscription update elements: ledcolors-imagestream-update, ledcolors-ledstream-update, and logmsg-update now return data under data instead of result.
  - Global configuration elements are now separated from instance-specific ones.
