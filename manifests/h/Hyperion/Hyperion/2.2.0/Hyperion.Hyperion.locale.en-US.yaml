ReleaseNotes: |-
  🚀 Hyperion 2.2.0 Release
  Hyperion 2.2.0 has arrived, bringing a significant leap in performance and stability. This release focuses on a massive core refactor designed to slash memory usage and optimize resource consumption. Alongside crucial security updates for Hue Bridge users and expanded RGBW support for WLED and e1.31 devices, we’ve introduced a completely rewritten Windows DDA grabber for better stability and a new DRM/KMS grabber tailored for Raspberry Pi OS users. These architectural overhauls ensure smoother, more efficient ambient lighting across all platforms while resolving long-standing resource bottlenecks.
  📥 Get Started & Download
  You can download the latest executables via our official repositories for Debian, Ubuntu, and Fedora, or grab the release files directly from GitHub.
  - For most users: Please visit our Getting Started Overview for instructions on installing or updating the software.
  - For Raspberry Pi users: We recommend HyperBian—a ready-to-use SD card image based on "Raspberry Pi OS Lite" with Hyperion pre-installed. Follow the HyperBian Step-by-Step Guide to get up and running quickly.

  ⚠️ Breaking Changes
  - Align Hue Bridge processing to Philips' guidance on security, i.e. no self-signed certificates for orginal bridges

  ✨ Added
  - Support of RGBW in e1.31 LED devices.
  - Support of RGBW in WLED, UDP-DDP, UDP-RAW LED devices.
  - HTTPS support for homeassistant LED devices (#1886)
  - Hue Bridge - Use https and certificates for all API calls, support Bridge Pro (V3)
  - Hue Bridge - Alternate certificate support
  - Linux: New DRM/KMS screen grabber with plane-based capture - not feature complete yet
  - Home Assistant: Dynamically set brightness for higher dynamic range (#1922)
  - Add DRM_FORMAT_RGB565 format to DRM frame grabber
  - Add standalone DRM grabber
  - Avoid queuing on image processing for output
  - Validation of RFC 4122 UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) elements and apply it e1.31 devices config screen

  🔧 Changed
  - Hue Bridge - Wizard updates to support bridge-ids, overall code refactoring
  - USB Grabber - Default hardware control properties are now applied when a new USB grabber is selected (avoids black images)
  - USB Grabber - Correct garbage default control values to avoid save issues (#1928)
  - Windows DDA Grabber - Rewritten grabber internals for better performance & stability and fixed various issues, e.g. screen locking, -orientation handling (#1872), sleep (#1893)
  - Amlogic grabber - Capture image in target size to avoid extra downscaling by CPU
  - Web UI: Update panel title uses "Hyperion - "; skip showing the "nightly" tag in releases list
  - Screen grabbers: Commonized base with getDeviceName/getInputDeviceDetails; explicit constructors; improved error handling
  - Framebuffer grabber: Internal cleanup, consistent device naming, safer mmap usage
  - Logger internals: use smart pointers and clean-ups
  - Align instance source settings for new instances with grabber enable state
  - Forwarder: Clear remote priority 1 when the forwarding instance is stopped
  - Fixes:
    - UI - Menu is not opened on small (mobile) screens
    - UI - Language is not selectable (#1877)
    - UI - Release were not shown on Update page
    - UI - Fixes for input/format selection
    - UI - Fix that gap-length could get negative
    - UI - Systray Settings is not using the actual port (#1964)
    - UI - Dashboard, wrap long version text
    - UI - Non local network connection is dropped without providing a reason (#1970)
    - CEC-Handler is not stopped every instance started
    - Qt-Grabber (Windows) does not apply pixel ratio (#1882) - Thanks to @SolberLight
    - LED-devices are not retrying to establish connectivity, if supported by the device
    - LED-devices are resolving IP-addresses for API and UDP two times in sequence
    - LED-device updates queue up and let Hyperion crash (#1887)
    - LED-device switch-off were not always executed during instance stopping
    - LED-Device latchTime was not considered correctly
    - LED-Device Adalight LightBerry APA102 Mode not working (#1961)
    - Segfault when turning an LED instance off (#1903)
    - Fix concurrent mDNS resolution (#1906) - Thanks to @discordianfish
    - The color of the backlight threshold is green, not white/gray (#1899)
    - Install - Ubuntu 25.10 unable to install due to libcec package (#1934)
    - hyperion-remote/standalone grabbers cannot resolve local address (#1909)
    - RAM Leak with hyperiond. Gbytes in a matter of days. (#1792)
    - Memory Leak with new Hyperion 2.1.1 on Windows 11 (#1892)
    - JSON-API: Instance Command without proper instances is using wrong instance ID
    - Import 2.1.1 config via 2.1.2 UI fails validation (#1907)
    - Memory/Image queuing issue when all instances are stopped but grabber is running
    - Forwarder was not using the correct target instance IDs for JSON requests
    - Flatbuffer/Protobuffer sources are not reconnected after (re)starting a hyperion instance
    - Flatbuffer/Protobuffer breaks, if socket drops while sending a reply
    - Adalight.ino changes due to FastLED update (#1942) Thanks to @JackSwieper
    - mdnsBrowser is not stopped properly on shutdown
    - ColorTypes are not correctly initialised to black
    - WebSockets are not closed properly when stopping Hyperion
    - Tracing is not initialized for hyperion remote executables
    - DDA Grabber is entering permanent error state when elevated or policy deny DDA
  - Refactors:
    - Fixed Image & ImageData and add debug logging (#1792, #1892)
    - Aligned grabbers with reworked Image handling avoiding extra copies
    - Moved Image & LEDData throttling to Callback, limit image size
