ReleaseNotes: |-
  This patch release introduces Qt6 support, deprecates LASH support, and fixes a number of bugs and inconsistencies found since version 1.2.4.
  Added
  - CLI options --log-colors and --no-log-colors to enable and disable ANSI colors in log messages.
  - CMake option -DWANT_QT6 to build Hydrogen using Qt6 instead of Qt5.
  - CLI option --user-data for both hydrogen and h2cli to provide an alternative user-level data folder.
  Changed
  - The shortcut for starting/pausing transport can now be used while focusing spin boxes (like the BPM one) too (#2098).
  - Combo boxes do not accept focus (and preventing shortcuts) anymore.
  - LASH support has been deprecated and will be removed in version 2.0 of Hydrogen (#1649).
  - Allow to select and copy version in About dialog (#2127).
  - Number of parallel build jobs in build.sh is now set dynamically to number of virtual processors (#2128).
  - Changelog was renamed CHANGELOG.md and converted from GNU-style changelog to markdown similar to https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/.
  - Hydrogen no longer uses XSD files to validate XML files during loading or via h2cli --check but uses direct XML inspection instead.
  - Minimal CMake version was bumped to 3.5.
  - Option -qt5 was introduced to native Windows build script windows/Build-WinNative.ps1 to build against Qt5 instead of Qt6 (default).
  - build.sh script compiles against Qt6 per default.
  Fixed
  - Fix compilation with LASH support enabled (#2076).
  - Fix Hue slider in Preferences > Appearance > Color (#2081).
  - Show the Crash Reporter and exit with return code 1 on unhandled exceptions.
  - Fix crashes in SampleEditor (#2092).
  - Fix track names in multi track export. When using just the file extension, the raw instrument names will be used (#2096).
  - Fix import bug for drumkits created in version >= 2.0.
  - Fix memory leakage for songs created in version >= 2.0.
  - Fix memory leakage for notes with probability < 1.0.
  - Fix incoming MIDI NOTE OFF handling.
  - AppImage build folder is now removed on build.sh r (#2129).
  - Fix potential crash with JACK audio driver on startup, teardown, or song/drumkit loading.
  - Fix freeze in native file dialogs on Linux (#2165).
  Removed
  - Qt XmlPatterns is no longer a dependency.
  - Folder linux/debian containing outdated Debian package rules used by the previous development team to distributed Hydrogen as .deb package.
  - Option -32bit was dropped in native Windows build script windows/Build-WinNative.ps1.
