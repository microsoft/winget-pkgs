ReleaseNotes: |-
  This patch release fixes a number of bugs and inconsistencies found since version 1.2.3 and is generally recommended for all users.
  Added
  - Forward compatibility for .h2song, .h2pattern, .h2playlist, and drumkit changes introduced in version 2.0.
  - MIDI and OSC commands
  - CLEAR_SELECTED_INSTRUMENT - to remove all notes of the selected pattern associated with the currently selected instrument.
  - CLEAR_PATTERN - to remove all notes of the selected pattern.
  - INSTRUMENT_PITCH - to adjust the pitch of an instrument.
  - OSC commands
  - NOTE_ON and NOTE_OFF which are handled like incoming MIDI events without triggering their associated actions.
  - CLEAR_INSTRUMENT - to remove all notes of the selected pattern associated with the provided instrument number.
  - CLI option:
    - -O/--osc-port to use a custom OSC port in both hydrogen and h2cli.
    - -L/--log-file to provide a path to an alternative log file.
    - -T/--log-timestamps to add timestamps to all log messages.
    - --config to use a different user-level config file.
    - --compression-level for h2cli to set the trade-off between max. quality (.mp3 and .ogg)/max. speed (.flac) (0.0) and max. compression (1.0) for exported audio files.
    - Adding support for importing and exporting audio files of format .mp3, .opus, .au, .caf, .voc, .w64. Drumkits containing those formats can be loaded with older versions of Hydrogen too. libsndfile >= 1.1.0 is required on your system for MP3 support. (#2023)
    - X-NSM-Exec entry added to org.hydrogenmusic.Hydrogen.desktop by @grammoboy2 (#2042).
    - Delete key does now remove selected notes and notes under cursor in NotePropertiesRuler.
  Changed
  - Brazilian translation updated.
  - Grid lines in the Song Editor are now rendered dotted to emphasize that this is the space the patterns in rather than objects in their own right.
  - Virtual keyboard strokes are now mapped exactly as incoming MIDI NOTE_ON events (respecting both "Use output note as input note" and hihat pressure groups). But do not trigger associated actions (#1770).
  - CLI option -d understand driver names regardless of capitalization.
  - h2cli option -V is now able to handle whitespaces between flag and argument.
  - h2cli long option for -k is renamed --drumkit -> kit in order to align the naming with the one used in hydrogen CLI options.
  - Smaller keyboard cursor size with resolution set to off.
  - Rename "J.Master" button into "Timebase".
  Fixed
  - Fix potential segfault on ill-formated notes in .h2song files.
  - Fix buzzing sound during startup when using Port Audio (#1932).
  - Fix build failure without precompiled headers (e.g. on Gentoo) (#1944).
  - Fix persistent of hihat pressure group settings while changing/restarting MIDI drivers.
  - Fix mapping of NOTE_OFF MIDI messages in hihat pressure groups.
  - Fix segfault when using MIDI sense button in table of Preferences > MIDI after removing rows above it from the table.
  - Fix synchronization problems while using JACK Timebase support (#1953).
  - Fix compilation error on macOS with case-sensitive filesystem (#1938).
  - Fix usability with large QT_SCALE_FACTOR (#1933).
  - Fix MIDI, WAV, and LilyPond export as well as drumkit import and export with with non-ASCII filenames (#1957).
  - Paths to songs and scripts are now properly saved relative to a .h2playlist file (in case the corresponding option was set).
  - Fix grid line rendering with resolution set to off (#2015).
  - Fix handling of adjacent tags with same content in Director by @aldimond (#2036).
  - Fix copy/cut/paste in PianoRollEditor.
  Removed
  - Windows 32bit support dropped (due to upstream limitations).
