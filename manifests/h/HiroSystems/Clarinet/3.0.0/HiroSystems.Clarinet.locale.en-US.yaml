ShortDescription: Command-line tool and runtime for the Clarity smart contract language.
Description: Clarinet is a Clarity runtime packaged as a command line tool, designed to facilitate smart contract understanding, development, testing and deployment. Clarinet consists of a Clarity REPL and a testing harness, which, when used together allow you to rapidly develop and test a Clarity smart contract, with the need to deploy the contract to a local devnet or testnet.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  While most recent features were shipped in the 2.x series, this 3.0.0 version allows us to stabilize the Clarity Formatter and Mainnet execution simulation features.
  With a major version bump comes breaking changes, mainly since the Clarinet JS SDK now uses Stacks.js v7. The most significant change for Clarity developers is how Stacks.js handles Clarity
  values.
  See the Stacks.js migration guide for more details.
  Install the latest Clarinet CLI version using Homebrew, Winget, or download the pre-built binaries below.
  To update your Clarinet projects with latest version of the SDK run the following command:
  npm install @hirosystems/clarinet-sdk@latest @stacks/transactions@latest
