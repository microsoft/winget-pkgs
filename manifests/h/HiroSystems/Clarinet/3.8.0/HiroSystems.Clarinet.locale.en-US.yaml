ShortDescription: Command-line tool and runtime for the Clarity smart contract language.
Description: Clarinet is a Clarity runtime packaged as a command line tool, designed to facilitate smart contract understanding, development, testing and deployment. Clarinet consists of a Clarity REPL and a testing harness, which, when used together allow you to rapidly develop and test a Clarity smart contract, with the need to deploy the contract to a local devnet or testnet.
