ReleaseNotes: |-
  Hi!
  On this Hotfix release we reverted a controversial change for Linux users where Proton versions other than Proton-GE were being hidden by default. This now only hides Proton Experimental and it is Opt-in instead of Opt-out.
  We also fixed the Environmental variables table and added a few couple of settings for using WoW64 on Linux and several other fixes and improvements.
  Let us know if you find any other issue. You can give us feedback on our official Discord or Github.
