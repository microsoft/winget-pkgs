ReleaseNotes: |-
  Hi!
  It's been just a few weeks since 2.19.1 came out but we felt that was time for another release due to some bugs we found in there and other improvements we had. In fact, our team is considering more frequent releases because then it's easier to catch bugs and receive feedback and improve the app.
  We are also considering having more Beta releases to test those big changes first before it goes into stable, this was really useful this week since we were able to find a major bug and we thank everyone who tested the 2.20-beta.1.
  If you find any other bug make sure to open an issue here on Github or on our Discord!
