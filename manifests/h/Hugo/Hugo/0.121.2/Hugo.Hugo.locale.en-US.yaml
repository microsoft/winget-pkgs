ReleaseNotes: |-
  The main motivation behind this release is a security fix in the upstream golang.org/x/crypto library. We don't see how that CVE could be exploited via Hugo, but we do appreciate that many want to have a clean security report.
  There's also some new features in this release:
  - AutoOrient image filter
  - math.Rand

  What's Changed
  - build(deps): bump golang.org/x/crypto from 0.16.0 to 0.17.0 1ccd314 @dependabot[bot]
  - tpl/math: Add math.Rand template function e40b9fb @jmooring #11833
  - resources/images: Create AutoOrient image filter 648d00c @jmooring #11717
  - all: Remove unused code 8adba64 @bep
