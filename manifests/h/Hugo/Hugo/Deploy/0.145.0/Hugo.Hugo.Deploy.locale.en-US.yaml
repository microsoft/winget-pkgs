ShortDescription: The world's fastest framework for building websites (with WebP encoding, Sass transpiling and Deploy website support)
# Description: |-
#   Hugo is one of the most popular open-source static site generators.
#   With its amazing speed and flexibility, Hugo makes building websites fun again.
#   Hugo is available in two flavors: standard and extended.
#   With the extended flavor you can:
#   - Encode WebP images (decoding is also available in the standard build)
#   - Transpile Sass to CSS using the embedded LibSass transpiler

# I'm not sure how to describe this version.
