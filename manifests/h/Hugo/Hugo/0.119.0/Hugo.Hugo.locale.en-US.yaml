ReleaseNotes: |-
  This version is built with Go 1.21.1 which contains some relevant security fixes for the html/template package, see Issue 62196 and Issue 62197. This is the main reason Hugo 0.119.0 is released sooner rather than later. But this release also comes with a dependency refresh and some useful image processing improvements:
  - A new general-purpose Process method and filter.
  - A new Opacity filter.

  Process support all of the existing scaling operations, but it can also be used do simple format conversions (e.g. from JPG to PNG). A before/after example:

  {{ $watermark := resources.Get "logo.jpg" | images.Filter
        (images.GaussianBlur 6)
        (images.Opacity 0.5)
  }}
  {{ $watermark = $watermark.Resize (printf "%dx%d png" $watermark.Width $watermark.Height )

  There are some issues with the above:
  1. The source image does not support transparency, so the transparency pixels will be filled with the configured background colour.
  2. The image will be decoded and encoded twice with a potential loss in quality.
  3. It's clumsy.

  With Hugo 0.119.0 the above can be written as:

  {{ $watermark := resources.Get "logo.jpg" | images.Filter
        (images.GaussianBlur 6)
        (images.Opacity 0.5)
        (images.Process "png")
  }}
