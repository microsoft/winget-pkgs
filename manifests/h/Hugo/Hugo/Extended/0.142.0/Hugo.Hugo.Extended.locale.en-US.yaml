ShortDescription: The world’s fastest framework for building websites (with WebP encoding and Sass transpiling support)
Description: |-
  Hugo is one of the most popular open-source static site generators.
  With its amazing speed and flexibility, Hugo makes building websites fun again.
  Hugo is available in two flavors: standard and extended.
  With the extended flavor you can:
  - Encode WebP images (decoding is also available in the standard build)
  - Transpile Sass to CSS using the embedded LibSass transpiler

ReleaseNotes: |-
  This is is mostly a bug fix release. It's a minor and not a patch release because of the image file cache issue fixes (see #13273 #13272). Fixing this required us to break the hashes for many of the generated images so we used this opportunity to simplify how we generate these hashes/image filenames.
