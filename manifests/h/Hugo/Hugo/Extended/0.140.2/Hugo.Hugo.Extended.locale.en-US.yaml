ShortDescription: The world’s fastest framework for building websites (with WebP encoding and Sass transpiling support)
Description: |-
  Hugo is one of the most popular open-source static site generators.
  With its amazing speed and flexibility, Hugo makes building websites fun again.
  Hugo is available in two flavors: standard and extended.
  With the extended flavor you can:
  - Encode WebP images (decoding is also available in the standard build)
  - Transpile Sass to CSS using the embedded LibSass transpiler

ReleaseNotes: |-
  The timing of this release comes from the security fix in golang.org/x/net's html.Parse function. This is used in two places in Hugo:
  1. Extracting table of contents from Asciidoctor rendered output.
  2. Collecting HTML classes etc. when build stats is enabled
  It's a little bit of a stretch to see how this could be exploited in Hugo, but we understand that many want a clean security report. See this issue for details.
