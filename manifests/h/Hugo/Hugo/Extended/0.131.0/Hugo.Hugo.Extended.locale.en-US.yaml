ShortDescription: The world’s fastest framework for building websites (with WebP encoding and Sass transpiling support)
Description: |-
  Hugo is one of the most popular open-source static site generators.
  With its amazing speed and flexibility, Hugo makes building websites fun again.
  Hugo is available in two flavors: standard and extended.
  With the extended flavor you can:
  - Encode WebP images (decoding is also available in the standard build)
  - Transpile Sass to CSS using the embedded LibSass transpiler

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Note that if you use Hugo's image processing, your processed images will get new (shorter!) file names when you build your site with this release. We have upgraded a third party hashing library to fix some rare but potential hash collisions, and since this would change some of the image hashes, we thought we might as well do some other related changes: We now use xxHash to create the image file hashes (very fast!) and we have removed the verbose processing information, making the filenames much shorter.
  This release is also a full dependency refresh and it comes with one notable and very useful new feature. It is now possible to use permalink tokens in the front matter url. See the documentation for more info. Thanks to @n1xx1 for the implementation.
