ShortDescription: The worldâ€™s fastest framework for building websites (with WebP encoding and Sass transpiling support)
Description: |-
  Hugo is one of the most popular open-source static site generators.
  With its amazing speed and flexibility, Hugo makes building websites fun again.
  Hugo is available in two flavors: standard and extended.
  With the extended flavor you can:
  - Encode WebP images (decoding is also available in the standard build)
  - Transpile Sass to CSS using the embedded LibSass transpiler

ReleaseNotes: |-
  The big new feature in this relase is the new version config option on Module imports, which allows you to set the requested module version query directly in your Hugo configuration (e.g. hugo.toml). This is a feature that have been requested by many, and I (@bep) was reminded about it by this recent thread, which also outlines a common use case for this: Mounting multiple old versions/branches of API documentation into the project.
  What's Changed
  - build(deps): bump golang.org/x/mod from 0.27.0 to 0.28.0 d1f6a1dc5 @dependabot[bot]
