ReleaseNotes: |-
  This release brings proper HTTP caching and live reloading of remote resources fetched with resources.GetRemote, especially useful when used with content adapters.
  Note that this isn't enabled out of the box, so if you need this, you need to add some configuration. The demo below is configured as:
  [httpcache]
  [httpcache.cache]
  [httpcache.cache.for]
  includes = ['https://sheets.googleapis.com/**']
  [[httpcache.polls]]
  high = '30s'
  low  = '1s'
  [httpcache.polls.for]
  includes = ['https://sheets.googleapis.com/**']
