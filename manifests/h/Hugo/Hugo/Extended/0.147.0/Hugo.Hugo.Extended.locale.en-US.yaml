ShortDescription: The world’s fastest framework for building websites (with WebP encoding and Sass transpiling support)
Description: |-
  Hugo is one of the most popular open-source static site generators.
  With its amazing speed and flexibility, Hugo makes building websites fun again.
  Hugo is available in two flavors: standard and extended.
  With the extended flavor you can:
  - Encode WebP images (decoding is also available in the standard build)
  - Transpile Sass to CSS using the embedded LibSass transpiler

ReleaseNotes: |-
  This release comes with a new aligny option (shoutout to @pranshugaba for the implementation) for images.Text that, in combination with alignx makes it simple to e.g. center the text on top of image in both axis. But the main reason this release comes now and not later, is the improvements/fixes to the order Hugo applies the default configuration to some keys. This is inherited from how we did this before we rewrote the configuration handling, and it made the merging of configuration from modules/themes into the config root harder and less flexible than it had to be. Me, @bep, looking into this, was triggered by this forum topic. Having many sites share a common configuration is very useful. With this release, you can simply get what the thread starter asks for by doing something à la:
  baseURL = "http://example.org"
  title = "My Hugo Site"

  # ... import any themes/modules.

  # This will merge in all config imported from imported modules.
  _merge = "deep"
  See the documentation for details.
