ReleaseNotes: |-
  This release is mostly motivated by some upstream security fixes:
  - Upgrade from Go 1.25.1 to Go 1.25.3 which comes with 10 security fixes.
  - Go's net/html package also has one security patch
  I, @bep, have inspected the above issues, and none of them seem to be relevant for Hugo, but we understand that many want to have a clean security report.
  Bug fixes
  - tpl: Fix strings/truncate CJK handling 88aea5668 @oishikazuo #14039
  - parser/pagerparser: Fix closing shortcode error handling when repeated a133393ed @bep
  Improvements
  - Upgrade Go to 1.25.3 e2fb0b0e8 @bep
  - create/skeletons: Wrap section and home lists with section tags 29cf87444 @imomaliev
  - markup/goldmark: Align blockquote default output with Goldmark 1b4dd436d @jmooring #14046
  - parser/pageparser: Store shortcode names as unique.Handle[string] to save memory allocations 4414ef73f @bep
