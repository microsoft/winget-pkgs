ShortDescription: A Powerful Claude Code GUI Desktop Application Built with Electron + React + TypeScript, providing complete Claude Code integration
Description: |-
  Claudiatron is a modern desktop application built with Electron + React + TypeScript, serving as a visual GUI for Claude Code. It evolved from the original Tauri version, providing a more comprehensive and stable Claude Code integration experience.
  Think of Claudiatron as your command center for Claude Code - bridging the gap between the command-line tool and an intuitive visual interface that makes AI-assisted development more efficient and convenient.
