ShortDescription: A tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently.
Description: |-
  Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. Terraform can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions.
  The key features of Terraform are:
  - Infrastructure as Code: Infrastructure is described using a high-level configuration syntax. This allows a blueprint of your datacenter to be versioned and treated as you would any other code. Additionally, infrastructure can be shared and re-used.
  - Execution Plans: Terraform has a "planning" step where it generates an execution plan. The execution plan shows what Terraform will do when you call apply. This lets you avoid any surprises when Terraform manipulates infrastructure.
  - Resource Graph: Terraform builds a graph of all your resources, and parallelizes the creation and modification of any non-dependent resources. Because of this, Terraform builds infrastructure as efficiently as possible, and operators get insight into dependencies in their infrastructure.
  - Change Automation: Complex changesets can be applied to your infrastructure with minimal human interaction. With the previously mentioned execution plan and resource graph, you know exactly what Terraform will change and in what order, avoiding many possible human errors.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  NEW FEATURES:
  - Added Terraform backend implementation for OCI Object Storage (#34465)
  ENHANCEMENTS:
  - Terraform Test command now accepts a -parallelism=n option, which sets the number of parallel operations in a test run's plan/apply operation. (#34237)
  - Logical binary operators can now short-circuit (#36224)
  - Terraform Test: Runs can now be annotated for possible parallel execution. (#34180)
  - Allow terraform init when tests are present but no configuration files are directly inside the current directory (#35040)
  - Terraform Test: Continue subsequent test execution when an expected failure is not encountered. (#34969)
  - Produce detailed diagnostic objects when test run assertions fail (#34428)
  - backend/oss: Supports more standard environment variables to keep same with provider setting (#36581)
  - Improved elapsed time display in UI Hook to show minutes and seconds in mm:ss format. (#36368)
  - Update legacy term used in error messages. (Terraform Cloud agent â‡’ HCP Terraform Agent) (#36706)
  - import blocks: Now support importing a resource via a new identity attribute. This is mutually exclusive with the id attribute (#36703)
  BUG FIXES:
  - Refreshed state was not used in the plan for orphaned resource instances (#36394)
  - Fixes malformed Terraform version error when the remote backend reads a remote workspace that specifies a Terraform version constraint. (#36356)
  - Changes to the order of sensitive attributes in the state format would erroneously indicate a plan contained changes when there were none. (#36465)
  - Avoid reporting duplicate attribute-associated diagnostics, such as "Available Write-only Attribute Alternative" (#36579)
  - for_each expressions in import blocks should not be able to reference the import target (#36801)
  UPGRADE NOTES:
  - On Linux, Terraform now requires Linux kernel version 3.2 or later; support for previous versions has been discontinued. (#36478)
