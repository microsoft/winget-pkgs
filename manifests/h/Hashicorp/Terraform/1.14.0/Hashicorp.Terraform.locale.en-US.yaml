ShortDescription: A tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently.
Description: |-
  Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. Terraform can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions.
  The key features of Terraform are:
  - Infrastructure as Code: Infrastructure is described using a high-level configuration syntax. This allows a blueprint of your datacenter to be versioned and treated as you would any other code. Additionally, infrastructure can be shared and re-used.
  - Execution Plans: Terraform has a "planning" step where it generates an execution plan. The execution plan shows what Terraform will do when you call apply. This lets you avoid any surprises when Terraform manipulates infrastructure.
  - Resource Graph: Terraform builds a graph of all your resources, and parallelizes the creation and modification of any non-dependent resources. Because of this, Terraform builds infrastructure as efficiently as possible, and operators get insight into dependencies in their infrastructure.
  - Change Automation: Complex changesets can be applied to your infrastructure with minimal human interaction. With the previously mentioned execution plan and resource graph, you know exactly what Terraform will change and in what order, avoiding many possible human errors.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  NEW FEATURES:
  - List Resources: List resources can be defined in *.tfquery.hcl files and allow querying and filterting existing infrastructure.
  - A new Terraform command terraform query: Executes list operations against existing infrastructure and displays the results. The command can optionally generate configuration for importing results into Terraform.
  - A new GenerateResourceConfiguration RPC allows providers to create more precise configuration values during import. (#37515)
  - New top-level Actions block: Actions are provider defined and meant to codify use cases outside the normal CRUD model in your Terraform configuration. Providers can define Actions like aws_lambda_invoke or aws_cloudfront_create_invalidation that do something imparative outside of Terraforms normal CRUD model. You can configure such a side-effect with an action block and have actions triggered through the lifecycle of a resource or through passing the -invoke CLI flag. (#37553)
  ENHANCEMENTS:
  - terraform test: expected diagnostics will be included in test output when running in verbose mode" (#37362)
  - terraform test: ignore prevent_destroy attribute during when cleaning up tests" (#37364)
  - terraform stacks command support for -help flag (#37645)
  - query: support offline validation of query files via -query flag in the validate command (#37671)
  - Updates to support the AWS European Sovereign Cloud (#37721)
  BUG FIXES:
  - Retrieve all workspace variables while doing a terraform import, include variables inherited from variable sets but not overwritten by the workspace. (#37241)
  - Fix OSS backend proxy support by adding a proxy layer for OSS backend operations. Resolves hashicorp/terraform#36897. (#36897)
  - console and test: return explicit diagnostics when referencing resources that were not included in the most recent operation. (#37663)
  - query: generate unique resource identifiers for results of expanded list resources (#37681)
  - The CLI now summarizes the number of actions invoked during terraform apply, matching the plan output. (#37689)
  - Allow filesystem functions to return inconsistent results when evaluated within provider configuration (#37854)
  - query: improve error handling for missing identity schemas (#37863)
  UPGRADE NOTES:
  - The parallelism of Terraform operations within container runtimes may be reduced depending on the CPU bandwidth limit setting. (#37436)
  - Building Terraform 1.14 requires macOS Monterey or later (due to being built on Go 1.25 which imposes these requirements) (#37436)
