  BUG FIXES:
  - On May 16th 2023, HCP introduced multi-project support to the platform. In order to use multiple projects in your organization, you will need to update Packer to version 1.9.1 or above. Starting with 1.9.1, you may specify a project ID to push builds to with the HCP_PROJECT_ID environment variable. If no project ID is specified, Packer will pick the project with the oldest creation date. Older versions of Packer are incompatible with multi-project support on HCP, and builds will fail for HCP organizations with multiple projects on versions before 1.9.1. GH-12453
