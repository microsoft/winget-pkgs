ReleaseNotes: |-
  NOTES:
    core: Users will see some changes in how names are displayed during a Packer build for JSON templates. Previously only the builder type or the builder name, if it was set, would be displayed. Now for named builders ("name":"mybuilder") the builder's type and name will be displayed (i.e ".mybuilder". This does not impact the behavior of options such as only or except, they will continue to work as they did before.)

  IMPROVEMENTS:
  - Bump bundled plugins to latest available version. GH-12271
  - bump github.com/hashicorp/hcp-sdk-go from 0.28.0 to 0.29.0 GH-12163
  - Bump github.com/hashicorp/hcp-sdk-go from 0.33.0 to 0.34.0 GH-12262
  - core/hcl2: Packer will no longer warn on excluded post-processors when using -only/exlude filters for running select builds. GH-12187

  BUG FIXES:
  - cmd/hcl2_upgrade: Fix crash when variables block is undefined. GH-12250
  - core/hcl2: Templates with build blocks referencing an unknown source block would display an empty string for the template filename at line 0, which made it difficult to identify the broken build block. Packer has been updated to display the proper filename and line number where the unknown reference resides. GH-12167
  - core: Linux packages now have vendor label and set the default label to HashiCorp. This fix is implemented for any future releases, but will not be updated for historical releases.
