ShortDescription: An identity-aware proxy that provides a simple, secure way to access hosts and critical systems on your network.
Description: |-
  Boundary is an identity-aware proxy that provides a simple, secure way to access hosts and critical systems on your network.
  With Boundary you can:
  - Integrate with your IdP of choice using OpenID Connect, enabling users to securely sign-in to their Boundary environment
  - Provide just-in-time network access to network resources, wherever they reside
  - Manage session credentials via a native static credential store, or dynamically generate unique per-session credentials by integrating with HashiCorp Vault
  - Automate discovery of new endpoints
  - Manage privileged sessions using Boundaryâ€™s session controls
  - Standardize your team's access workflow with a consistent experience for any type of infrastructure across any provider
  Boundary is designed to be straightforward to understand, highly scalable, and resilient. It can run in clouds, on-prem, secure enclaves and more, and does not require an agent to be installed on every end host, making it suitable for access to managed/cloud services and container-based workflows in addition to traditional host systems and services.
