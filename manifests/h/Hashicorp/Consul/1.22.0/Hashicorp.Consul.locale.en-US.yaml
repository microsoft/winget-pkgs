ShortDescription: A distributed, highly available, and data center aware solution to connect and configure applications across dynamic, distributed infrastructure.
Description: |-
  Consul is a distributed, highly available, and data center aware solution to connect and configure applications across dynamic, distributed infrastructure.
  Consul provides several key features:
  - Multi-Datacenter - Consul is built to be datacenter aware, and can support any number of regions without complex configuration.
  - Service Mesh - Consul Service Mesh enables secure service-to-service communication with automatic TLS encryption and identity-based authorization. Applications can use sidecar proxies in a service mesh configuration to establish TLS connections for inbound and outbound connections with Transparent Proxy.
  - API Gateway - Consul API Gateway manages access to services within Consul Service Mesh, allow users to define traffic and authorization policies to services deployed within the mesh.
  - Service Discovery - Consul makes it simple for services to register themselves and to discover other services via a DNS or HTTP interface. External services such as SaaS providers can be registered as well.
  - Health Checking - Health Checking enables Consul to quickly alert operators about any issues in a cluster. The integration with service discovery prevents routing traffic to unhealthy hosts and enables service level circuit breakers.
  - Dynamic App Configuration - An HTTP API that allows users to store indexed objects within Consul, for storing configuration parameters and application metadata.

  SECURITY:
  - connect: Upgrade Consul's bundled Envoy version to 1.35.3 and remove support for 1.31.10. This update also includes a fix to prevent Envoy (v1.35+) startup failures by only configuring the TLS transport socket when the CA bundle is present. [GH-22824]
