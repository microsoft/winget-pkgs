ShortDescription: A distributed, highly available, and data center aware solution to connect and configure applications across dynamic, distributed infrastructure.
Description: |-
  Consul is a distributed, highly available, and data center aware solution to connect and configure applications across dynamic, distributed infrastructure.
  Consul provides several key features:
  - Multi-Datacenter - Consul is built to be datacenter aware, and can support any number of regions without complex configuration.
  - Service Mesh - Consul Service Mesh enables secure service-to-service communication with automatic TLS encryption and identity-based authorization. Applications can use sidecar proxies in a service mesh configuration to establish TLS connections for inbound and outbound connections with Transparent Proxy.
  - API Gateway - Consul API Gateway manages access to services within Consul Service Mesh, allow users to define traffic and authorization policies to services deployed within the mesh.
  - Service Discovery - Consul makes it simple for services to register themselves and to discover other services via a DNS or HTTP interface. External services such as SaaS providers can be registered as well.
  - Health Checking - Health Checking enables Consul to quickly alert operators about any issues in a cluster. The integration with service discovery prevents routing traffic to unhealthy hosts and enables service level circuit breakers.
  - Dynamic App Configuration - An HTTP API that allows users to store indexed objects within Consul, for storing configuration parameters and application metadata.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  SECURITY:
  - security: upgrade go version to 1.25.7 [GH-23204]
  - dockerfile: the Consul build Go base image to alpine3.23 [GH-23194]
  - connect: Migrate to aws-sdk-go-v2 from aws-sdk-go (v1). Also updated consul-awsauth and go-secure-stdlib/awsutil dependencies to their v2 versions. [GH-23109]
  - security: Configure HTTP server timeouts to prevent Slowloris denial-of-service attacks on agent HTTP endpoints and pprof endpoints. [GH-22739]
  - security: Patched Vault CA provider to prevent arbitrary file reads via Kubernetes, JWT, and AppRole methods. [GH-23249]
  - security: Introduced debounce timing for synchronization operations within federationStateAntiEntropySync. [GH-23196]
  IMPROVEMENTS:
  - api-gateway: Fixed "duplicate matcher" errors in Envoy when using multiple file-system certificates on a single TLS listener. The certificates are now consolidated into a single filter chain, allowing Envoy to select the correct one. [GH-23212]
  - agent: Fix vault provider failure when signing intermediate CA with isCA=true in CSR [GH-23202]
  - cli: Added --aws-iam-endpoint flag to consul login command for AWS IAM auth method to support custom IAM endpoint configuration [GH-23109]
  - docs: Refreshed the security documentation to include the new HTTP server timeout defaults and relevant configuration options. [GH-23246]
