ShortDescription: An easy-to-use, flexible, and performant workload orchestrator that can deploy a mix of microservice, batch, containerized, and non-containerized applications.
Description: |-
  Nomad is a simple and flexible workload orchestrator to deploy and manage containers (docker, podman), non-containerized applications (executable, Java), and virtual machines (qemu) across on-prem and clouds at scale.
  Nomad provides several key features:
  - Deploy Containers and Legacy Applications: Nomadâ€™s flexibility as an orchestrator enables an organization to run containers, legacy, and batch applications together on the same infrastructure. Nomad brings core orchestration benefits to legacy applications without needing to containerize via pluggable task drivers.
  - Simple & Reliable: Nomad runs as a single binary and is entirely self contained - combining resource management and scheduling into a single system. Nomad does not require any external services for storage or coordination. Nomad automatically handles application, node, and driver failures. Nomad is distributed and resilient, using leader election and state replication to provide high availability in the event of failures.
  - Device Plugins & GPU Support: Nomad offers built-in support for GPU workloads such as machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). Nomad uses device plugins to automatically detect and utilize resources from hardware devices such as GPU, FPGAs, and TPUs.
  - Federation for Multi-Region, Multi-Cloud: Nomad was designed to support infrastructure at a global scale. Nomad supports federation out-of-the-box and can deploy applications across multiple regions and clouds.
  - Proven Scalability: Nomad is optimistically concurrent, which increases throughput and reduces latency for workloads. Nomad has been proven to scale to clusters of 10K+ nodes in real-world production environments.
  - HashiCorp Ecosystem: Nomad integrates seamlessly with Terraform, Consul, Vault for provisioning, service discovery, and secrets management.
ReleaseNotes: |-
  BREAKING CHANGES:
  - api: The non-functional option -peer-address has been removed from the operator raft remove-peer command and equivalent API [GH-25599]
  - core: Errors encountered when reloading agent configuration will now cause agents to exit. Before configuration errors during reloads were only logged. This could lead to agents running but unable to communicate [GH-25721]
  SECURITY:
  - build: Update Go to 1.24.3 to address CVE-2025-22873 [GH-25818]
  IMPROVEMENTS:
  - command: added priority flag to job dispatch command [GH-25622]
  BUG FIXES:
  - agent: Fixed a bug where reloading the agent with systemd notification enabled would cause the agent to be killed by system [GH-25636]
  - cli: Respect NOMAD_REGION environment variable in operator debug command [GH-25716]
  - client: fix failure cleaning up namespace on batch jobs [GH-25714]
  - docker: Fix missing stats for rss, cache and swap memory for cgroups v1 [GH-25741]
  - encrypter: Refactor startup decryption task handling to avoid timing problems with task addition on FSM restore [GH-25795]
  - java: Fixed a bug where the default task user was set to 'nobody' on Windows [GH-25648]
  - metrics: Fixed a bug where RSS and cache stats would not be reported for docker, exec, and java drivers under Linux cgroups v2 [GH-25751]
  - scheduler: Fixed a bug in accounting for resources.cores that could prevent placements on nodes with available cores [GH-25705]
  - scheduler: Fixed a bug where draining a node with canaries could result in a stuck deployment [GH-25726]
  - scheduler: Fixed a bug where updating the rescheduler tracker could corrupt the state store [GH-25698]
  - scheduler: Use core ID when selecting cores. This fixes a panic in the scheduler when the reservable_cores is not a contiguous list of core IDs. [GH-25340]
  - server: Added a new server configuration option named start_timeout with a default value of 30s. This duration is used to monitor the server setup and startup processes which must complete before it is considered healthy, such as keyring decryption. If these processes do not complete before the timeout is reached, the server process will exit. [GH-25803]
  - ui: Fixed a bug where the job list page incorrectly calculated if a job had paused tasks. [GH-25742]
