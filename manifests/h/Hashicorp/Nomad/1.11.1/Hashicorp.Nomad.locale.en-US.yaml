ShortDescription: An easy-to-use, flexible, and performant workload orchestrator that can deploy a mix of microservice, batch, containerized, and non-containerized applications.
Description: |-
  Nomad is a simple and flexible workload orchestrator to deploy and manage containers (docker, podman), non-containerized applications (executable, Java), and virtual machines (qemu) across on-prem and clouds at scale.
  Nomad provides several key features:
  - Deploy Containers and Legacy Applications: Nomad’s flexibility as an orchestrator enables an organization to run containers, legacy, and batch applications together on the same infrastructure. Nomad brings core orchestration benefits to legacy applications without needing to containerize via pluggable task drivers.
  - Simple & Reliable: Nomad runs as a single binary and is entirely self contained - combining resource management and scheduling into a single system. Nomad does not require any external services for storage or coordination. Nomad automatically handles application, node, and driver failures. Nomad is distributed and resilient, using leader election and state replication to provide high availability in the event of failures.
  - Device Plugins & GPU Support: Nomad offers built-in support for GPU workloads such as machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). Nomad uses device plugins to automatically detect and utilize resources from hardware devices such as GPU, FPGAs, and TPUs.
  - Federation for Multi-Region, Multi-Cloud: Nomad was designed to support infrastructure at a global scale. Nomad supports federation out-of-the-box and can deploy applications across multiple regions and clouds.
  - Proven Scalability: Nomad is optimistically concurrent, which increases throughput and reduces latency for workloads. Nomad has been proven to scale to clusters of 10K+ nodes in real-world production environments.
  - HashiCorp Ecosystem: Nomad integrates seamlessly with Terraform, Consul, Vault for provisioning, service discovery, and secrets management.
ReleaseNotes: |-
  BREAKING CHANGES:
  - docker: removed deprecated email auth config parameter [GH-27156]
  SECURITY:
  - build: Updated toolchain to Go 1.25.5 [GH-27186]
  IMPROVEMENTS:
  - connect: allow configuring identities for sidecar_task [GH-25877]
  - landlock: check paths exist on setup [GH-27149]
  - oidc: add support for array-based OIDC claims [GH-26958]
  - qemu: Adds config parameters to modify qemu emulator binary and machine types and removes some hardcoded KVM accelerator settings. Defaults to previously used values of qemu-system-x86_64 and pc. The driver no longer forces machine type "host", or the -smp flag when using resources.cores with the KVM accelerator. [GH-27128]
  - secrets: Adds nomad job ID and namespace to plugin environment [GH-27207]
  BUG FIXES:
  - acl: Made /agent and /recommendations endpoints workload-identity-aware [GH-27099]
  - acl: include additional necessary permissions in the course-grained "scale" policy for nomad-autoscaler [GH-27061]
  - api: Fixed a bug in the Go API where an event stream request without a topic filter would require a management token [GH-27065]
  - cli: Fixed the var get command which was incorrectly displaying the variable modify time as the create time [GH-27208]
  - client: return 403 when the caller doesn't have log streaming capabilities [GH-27098]
  - csi: Fixed a bug where reading a volume from the API or event stream could erase its secrets [GH-27176]
  - drain: Fixed a bug where clients configured with leave_on_terminate or leave_on_interrupt and drain_on_shutdown would receive a permission denied error when attempting to leave the cluster and drain themselves [GH-27115]
  - dynamic host volumes: Ensure requested directory permission is correctly applied [GH-27068]
  - dynamic host volumes: fix Windows compatibility [GH-27147]
  - fingerprint: simplify storage fingerprint calculation to just (total disk space - reserved disk) [GH-27019]
  - keyring: Do not mark the key as inactive until all follow-up rekey evals have completed. [GH-27193]
  - keyring: Ensure follow-up rekey evals can be successfully created. [GH-27193]
  - oidc: Add support for RFC9207, requiring an issuer param in authorization response if the provider requires it [GH-27168]
  - reconciler: fixes a bug where stopping a job does not stop all allocations [GH-27175]
  - scheduler (Enterprise): Fixed a bug where tasks were not placed on same numa node as reserved device [GH-27177]
  - scheduler: Fixed a bug that was previously patched incorrectly where rescheduled allocations that could not be placed would later ignore their reschedule policy limits [GH-27129]
  - server: Fixed a bug where a large backlog of unblocking evals could cause backpressure on Raft writes [GH-27184]
  - ui: Fixed the error message presented for invalid Variables definitions [GH-26235]
