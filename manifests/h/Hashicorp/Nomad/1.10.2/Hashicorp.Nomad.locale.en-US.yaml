ShortDescription: An easy-to-use, flexible, and performant workload orchestrator that can deploy a mix of microservice, batch, containerized, and non-containerized applications.
Description: |-
  Nomad is a simple and flexible workload orchestrator to deploy and manage containers (docker, podman), non-containerized applications (executable, Java), and virtual machines (qemu) across on-prem and clouds at scale.
  Nomad provides several key features:
  - Deploy Containers and Legacy Applications: Nomad’s flexibility as an orchestrator enables an organization to run containers, legacy, and batch applications together on the same infrastructure. Nomad brings core orchestration benefits to legacy applications without needing to containerize via pluggable task drivers.
  - Simple & Reliable: Nomad runs as a single binary and is entirely self contained - combining resource management and scheduling into a single system. Nomad does not require any external services for storage or coordination. Nomad automatically handles application, node, and driver failures. Nomad is distributed and resilient, using leader election and state replication to provide high availability in the event of failures.
  - Device Plugins & GPU Support: Nomad offers built-in support for GPU workloads such as machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). Nomad uses device plugins to automatically detect and utilize resources from hardware devices such as GPU, FPGAs, and TPUs.
  - Federation for Multi-Region, Multi-Cloud: Nomad was designed to support infrastructure at a global scale. Nomad supports federation out-of-the-box and can deploy applications across multiple regions and clouds.
  - Proven Scalability: Nomad is optimistically concurrent, which increases throughput and reduces latency for workloads. Nomad has been proven to scale to clusters of 10K+ nodes in real-world production environments.
  - HashiCorp Ecosystem: Nomad integrates seamlessly with Terraform, Consul, Vault for provisioning, service discovery, and secrets management.
ReleaseNotes: |-
  BREAKING CHANGES:
  - template: Support for the following non-hermetic sprig functions has been removed: sprig_date, sprig_dateInZone, sprig_dateModify, sprig_htmlDate, sprig_htmlDateInZone, sprig_dateInZone, sprig_dateModify, sprig_randAlphaNum, sprig_randAlpha, sprig_randAscii, sprig_randNumeric, sprig_randBytes, sprig_uuidv4, sprig_env, sprig_expandenv, and sprig_getHostByName. [GH-25998]
  SECURITY:
  - identity: Fixed bug where workflow identity policies are matched by job ID prefix (CVE-2025-4922) [GH-25869]
  - template: Bump the consul-template version to resolve CVE-2025-27144, CVE-2025-22869, CVE-2025-22870 and CVE-2025-22872. [GH-25998]
  - template: Removed support to the non-hermetic sprig_env, sprig_expandenv, and sprig_getHostByName sprig functions to prevent potential leakage of environment or network information, since they can allow reading environment variables or resolving domain names to IP addresses. [GH-25998]
  IMPROVEMENTS:
  - cli: Added job start command to allow starting a stopped job from the cli [GH-24150]
  - client: Add gc_volumes_on_node_gc configuration to delete host volumes when nodes are garbage collected [GH-25903]
  - client: add ability to set maximum allocation count by adding node_max_allocs to client configuration [GH-25785]
  - host volumes: Add -force flag to volume delete command for removing volumes from GC'd nodes [GH-25902]
  - identity: Allow ACL policies to be applied to a namespace [GH-25871]
  - ipv6: bind and advertise addresses are now made to adhere to RFC-5942 §4 (reference: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5952.html#section-4) [GH-25921]
  - reporting (Enterprise): Added support for offline utilization reporting [GH-25844]
  - template: adds ability to specify once mode for job templates [GH-25922]
  - wi: new API endpoint for listing workload-attached ACL policies [GH-25588]
  BUG FIXES:
  - api: Fixed pagination bug which could result in duplicate results [GH-25792]
  - client: Fixed a bug where disconnect.stop_on_client_after timeouts were extended or ignored [GH-25946]
  - csi: Fixed -secret values not being sent with the nomad volume snapshot delete command [GH-26022]
  - disconnect: Fixed a bug where pending evals for reconnected allocs were not cancelled [GH-25923]
  - driver: Allow resources.cpu values above the maximum cpu.share value on Linux [GH-25963]
  - job: Ensure sidecar task volume_mounts are added to planning diff object [GH-25878]
  - reconnecting client: fix issue where reconcile strategy was sometimes ignored [GH-25799]
  - scaling: Set the scaling policies to disabled when a job is stopped [GH-25911]
  - scheduler: Fixed a bug where a node with no affinity could be selected over a node with low affinity [GH-25800]
  - scheduler: Fixed a bug where planning or running a system job with constraints & previously running allocations would return a failed allocation error [GH-25850]
  - telemetry: Fix excess CPU consumption from alloc stats collection [GH-25870]
  - telemetry: Fixed a bug where alloc stats were still collected (but not published) if telemetry.publish_allocation_metrics=false. [GH-25870]
  - ui: Fix incorrect calculation of permissions when ACLs are disabled which meant actions such as client drains were incorrectly blocked [GH-25881]
