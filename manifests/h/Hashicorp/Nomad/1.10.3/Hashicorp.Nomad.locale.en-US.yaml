ShortDescription: An easy-to-use, flexible, and performant workload orchestrator that can deploy a mix of microservice, batch, containerized, and non-containerized applications.
Description: |-
  Nomad is a simple and flexible workload orchestrator to deploy and manage containers (docker, podman), non-containerized applications (executable, Java), and virtual machines (qemu) across on-prem and clouds at scale.
  Nomad provides several key features:
  - Deploy Containers and Legacy Applications: Nomadâ€™s flexibility as an orchestrator enables an organization to run containers, legacy, and batch applications together on the same infrastructure. Nomad brings core orchestration benefits to legacy applications without needing to containerize via pluggable task drivers.
  - Simple & Reliable: Nomad runs as a single binary and is entirely self contained - combining resource management and scheduling into a single system. Nomad does not require any external services for storage or coordination. Nomad automatically handles application, node, and driver failures. Nomad is distributed and resilient, using leader election and state replication to provide high availability in the event of failures.
  - Device Plugins & GPU Support: Nomad offers built-in support for GPU workloads such as machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). Nomad uses device plugins to automatically detect and utilize resources from hardware devices such as GPU, FPGAs, and TPUs.
  - Federation for Multi-Region, Multi-Cloud: Nomad was designed to support infrastructure at a global scale. Nomad supports federation out-of-the-box and can deploy applications across multiple regions and clouds.
  - Proven Scalability: Nomad is optimistically concurrent, which increases throughput and reduces latency for workloads. Nomad has been proven to scale to clusters of 10K+ nodes in real-world production environments.
  - HashiCorp Ecosystem: Nomad integrates seamlessly with Terraform, Consul, Vault for provisioning, service discovery, and secrets management.
ReleaseNotes: |-
  IMPROVEMENTS:
  - consul: Added kind field to service block for Consul service registrations [GH-26170]
  - docker: Added support for cgroup namespaces in the task config [GH-25927]
  - task environment: new NOMAD_UNIX_ADDR env var points to the task API unix socket, for use with workload identity [GH-25598]
  BUG FIXES:
  - agent: Fixed a bug to prevent a possible panic during graceful shutdown [GH-26018]
  - agent: Fixed a bug to prevent panic during graceful server shutdown [GH-26171]
  - agent: Fixed bug where agent would exit early from graceful shutdown when managed by systemd [GH-26023]
  - cli: Fix panic when restarting stopped job with no scaling policies [GH-26131]
  - cli: Fixed a bug in the tls cert create command that always added "<role>.global.nomad"` to the certificate DNS names, even when the specified region was not "global"`. [GH-26086]
  - cli: Fixed a bug where the acl token self command only performed lookups for tokens set as environment variables and not by the -token flag. [GH-26183]
  - client: Attempt to rollback directory creation when the mkdir plugin fails to perform ownership changes on it [GH-26194]
  - client: Fixed bug where drained batch jobs would not be rescheduled if no eligible nodes were immediately available [GH-26025]
  - docker: Fixed a bug where very low resources.cpu values could generate invalid cpu weights on hosts with very large client.cpu_total_compute values [GH-26081]
  - host volumes: Fixed a bug where volumes with server-terminal allocations could be deleted from clients but not the state store [GH-26213]
  - tls: Fixed a bug where reloading the Nomad server process with an updated tls.verify_server_hostname configuration parameter would not apply an update to internal RPC handler verification and require a full server restart [GH-26107]
  - vault: Fixed a bug where non-periodic tokens would not have their TTL incremented to the lease duration [GH-26041]
