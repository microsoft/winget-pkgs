  Upgrade Notice
  Before updating HandBrake, please make sure there are no pending encodes in the queue, and be sure to make a backup of any custom presets and app preferences you have, as they may not be compatible with newer versions.
  Windows users, please make sure to install Microsoft .NET Desktop Runtime version 8.0.x. Read carefully: you need the DESKTOP runtime.
