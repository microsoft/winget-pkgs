ShortDescription: Official Hamster Republic Role Playing Game Construction Engine
Description: The OHRRPGCE is a free and open-source, cross-platform (Windows, Mac, GNU/Linux, Android), and easy-to-use utility with which you can create your own 2D RPG game in a style similar to the classic Final Fantasy games on the NES, SNES and GBA which have so shaped the RPG genre. No programming is required to create a game, though there is a scripting language for customising the engine which has been used to create many non-RPG games.
