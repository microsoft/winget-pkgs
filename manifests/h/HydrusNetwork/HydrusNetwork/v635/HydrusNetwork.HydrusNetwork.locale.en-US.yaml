ShortDescription: A personal booru-style media tagger that can import files and tags from your hard drive and popular websites. Content can be shared with other users via user-run servers.
Description: |-
  The hydrus network client is an application written for Anon and other internet-fluent media nerds who have large image/swf/webm collections.
  It browses with tags instead of folders, a little like a booru on your desktop. Advanced users can share tags and files anonymously through custom servers that any user may run.
  Everything is free and privacy is the first concern. Executable releases are available for Windows, Linux, and macOS.
  The program is in python, so you can also run it straight from the source code.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  misc
  - with help from a user, the manual file->import files dialog has a new 'search subdirectories' checkbox, default on, that, if off, allows you to just search the files in the base dir
  - import folders now also have a checkbox for 'search subdirectories', for the same thing
  - the importer 'file log' menu now offers to remove everything except unknown (i.e. unstarted) items from the queue
  - the network->data->review current network jobs window now has auto-refresh, with custom time delta
  - if the client files manager runs into a critical drive error and subs, paged importers, and import folders are paused, the file->import and export folders->pause menu is now correctly updated immediately to reflect this
  cog icons
  - after various discussions about 'advanced mode', I've decided to push more on cog icon buttons to tuck away advanced settings and commands. I hope to slowly slowly migrate most 'advanced mode' stuff to cog icons and similar
  - I fired up Inkscape and made a new .svg cog icon. it will draw with nice antialiasing and scale up nicely as we move to UI-scale-scaling buttons in future. please bear with my artistic skill, but I think it is ok in both light and dark modes. the recent cool thing is, if it isn't to your taste, you can now replace/edit the file yourself and put a copy in /db/static and hydrus will use that instead
  - the file sort widget, when set to namespaces mode, now tucks the tag service selector button and tag display type selector button (previously also only visible in advanced mode), into a cog icon button
  - the file collect widget now always has a cog icon. it handles tag service and tag display type selection
  - the file sort widget in 'num tags' sort now has a cog icon allowing tag service selection. the current tag service of the search page no longer controls the tag service in these sorts--you set what you want
  retry icon
  - the 'retry failed' and 'retry ignored' buttons in gallery pages, watcher pages, edit subscriptions, and edit subscription panels are now collapsed into one new menu icon button. this liberates a row of space in the downloader pages
  - lists across the program will update their button 'enabled' status instantly after various advanced commands now. if you see the list text change, the buttons should update
  boring stuff
  - wrote a nicer menu templating system (old system was all horrible tuple hardcoding)
  - the scrollable menu choice buttons now all use the new templating system
  - the menu icon buttons now all use the new templating system
  - the menu buttons now all use the new templating system
  - wrote a 'cog icon' class just to keep track of it nicely across the program
  - fixed up alignment and position (cog icons will now generally always go far right) of buttons in network job widget
  - secondary file sort now applies within collections
  - I did some prep work for allowing customisable secondary sort on any file page, but we aren't quite there yet
  - replace my ancient 'buffered window icon' widget with a simple QLabel with a pixmap, affecting: the trash and inbox icons in the media viewer top-right hover, Mr Bones, Lain, and the 'open externally' thumb-and-button widget in the media viewer
  - brushed up the grammar of the various 'text-and-gauge' stuff that I moved to always be zero-indexed the other week, particularly in the subscription popups
  boring url stuff
  - updated URLClass to now hold a static one-domain URLDomainMask and use it for all internal netloc tests and subdomain clipping
  - added raw domain rules to the new URLDomainMask
  - added more URLDomainMask unit tests for this
  - added a unit test to better check discarding subdomains at the url class level
  - fixed 'www'-stripping alternate-url searching for urls with more components like www.subdomain.something.something
  - the network engine is now more tolerant of non-urls, only checking strictly when you input into downloaders. previously, any normalise call on something that didn't parse would raise an error--now it is a no-op. the client api will respond to invalid get_url_x and associate_url URL params as best it can rather than responding with 400 (while still erroring out on add_url), and when you export urls with a sidecar, invalid urls should be outputted ok
