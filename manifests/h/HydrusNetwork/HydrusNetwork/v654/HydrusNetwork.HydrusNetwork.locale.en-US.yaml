ShortDescription: A personal booru-style media tagger that can import files and tags from your hard drive and popular websites. Content can be shared with other users via user-run servers.
Description: |-
  The hydrus network client is an application written for Anon and other internet-fluent media nerds who have large image/swf/webm collections.
  It browses with tags instead of folders, a little like a booru on your desktop. Advanced users can share tags and files anonymously through custom servers that any user may run.
  Everything is free and privacy is the first concern. Executable releases are available for Windows, Linux, and macOS.
  The program is in python, so you can also run it straight from the source code.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  command palette
  - reorganised the command palette options panel and updated how the character search threshold works. you can now say 'show all my x initially' for a particular search result type and then set a character limit for the general searches. the default and min value for the character search threshold is now 1
  slideshow
  - the slideshow menu in the media viewer has been shuffled a bit to tuck everything together
  - the slideshow menu now also appears in the top hover of the normal 'browser' media viewer, in a new icon button beside the 'move randomly' button
  - the sildeshow menu now has a 'slideshows move randomly' option. this thing is a global setting, mostly a test. let me know how it works out
  misc
  - the manage subscription dialog now nags you with red text if you set a downloader that appears to fetch from multiple sites (i.e. it is an NGUG that has multiple domains in its example urls). although it sounds temptingly convenient to set up a sub with a multi-site NGUG, they don't work so great like this, so the panel now says so and tells you what to do instead
  - added a When finishing archive/delete filtering, delay activation of multiple deletion choice buttons checkbox, default True, to options->files and trash, so you can now disable the 1.2 second delay on the delete/commit buttons when there are multiple deletion choices
  - made new svg icons for 'image', (which turns up when hydrus can't find a thumb for an image file), 'images' which turns up in the command palette as a 'media' proxy for media menu results, and the new 'slideshow' icon button. I like how these look at high res, but the smaller ones look bleh tbh. we'll have a review of all my new svgs when I finally add icon button sizing options and boost the default up a bit
  - options->media viewer now has split up mouse and seek bar settings. the seek bar panel has a new Seek bar full-height pop-in requires window focus checkbox, which is now default True
  - fixed svg resolution fetching (and probably all sorts of related svg gubbins) in PyQt6 (this is an alternate version of Qt some source users may be running)
  boring and cleanup
  - overhauled how the command palette does some search string handling and cleaned up a couple of logic things like whitespace no longer counts as a new char, etc..
  - the code behind the slideshow is all cleaner and decoupled application command stuff
  - I went through and renamed some 'scanbar' labels to the more canonical 'seek bar'
  - the 'eye' icon button in the media viewer top hover is recollected into window/hovers/rendering submenu categories
  - fixed the vacuum command to no longer check the temp dir for free space in the lower-db call--the newer 'vacuum into' command we use no longer needs a temp copy
  - might have fixed a bad 'Go!' confirmation dialog string generation in migrate tags that hits users for whom Mercury is in retrograde
  - improved the error handling for when my new async subprocess reader tries to read from a process that terminates early
  - fixed some unit test 'call after' job scheduling stuff with the same anti-deadlock handling I added to the main client a while ago
  admin and docs
  - created a hydrus_dev@proton.me email address and added it to all my contact lists. please feel free to email me there if you prefer--I'll check it as often as my gmail
  - to stop new users missing it, the 'Wayland' warning box in the Linux install and source help now starts uncollapsed
  - added a note about libxkbcommon for X11 support on Fedora too
  - wrote a 'help I had a file identifier missing error.txt' document for the db dir to handle the 'aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa34bf0b9abf7683e3955781212d0d1899' emergency hash-recovery situation
