ShortDescription: A personal booru-style media tagger that can import files and tags from your hard drive and popular websites. Content can be shared with other users via user-run servers.
Description: |-
  The hydrus network client is an application written for Anon and other internet-fluent media nerds who have large image/swf/webm collections.
  It browses with tags instead of folders, a little like a booru on your desktop. Advanced users can share tags and files anonymously through custom servers that any user may run.
  Everything is free and privacy is the first concern. Executable releases are available for Windows, Linux, and macOS.
  The program is in python, so you can also run it straight from the source code.
