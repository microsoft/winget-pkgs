Description: |-
  HakuNeko is a cross-platform downloader for manga and anime from various websites.
  HakuNeko was made to help users who download media for circumstances that requires offline usage.
  The philosophy is ad-hoc consumption, get it when you want to read/watch it. It is not meant to be
  a mass downloader to stock up thousands of chapters that are just collected and will probably never
  be read.
