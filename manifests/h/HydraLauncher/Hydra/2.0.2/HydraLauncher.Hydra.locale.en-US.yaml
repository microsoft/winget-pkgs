ReleaseNotes: |-
  Hello again! We're bringing some amazing fixes and a few small new features to Hydra 2.0.2.
  - We've corrected the issues with torrent downloads that they'll get stuck at 0% or take really long time in order to start
  - Added the possibility to select shortcuts when adding an executable to a game
  - We've improved the Real-Debrid download algorithm. Downloads now are up to 30% faster!
  - Fixed a bug where some users will get an infinite loading on the profile
  - Fixed a bug where Hydra would not start with Windows even though this option has been marked
