ShortDescription: X-Mouse Button Control is a free tool for Windows that allows you to re-configure and expand the capabilities of your mouse.
Description: X-Mouse Button Control (XMBC) allows you to create application and window specific profiles. This in turn, allows you to re-configure your mouse behaviour for individual applications or windows. For each profile you can also configure up to 10 'layers' of different button configurations which you can switch between using hot-keys or mouse buttons.

# Agreements:
ReleaseNotes: |-
  - #810 - Fixed issue with simkey repeat timer resolution meaning delay times under 15ms were unachievable.
  - #809 - Fixed regression with HOLDMS causing cumulative delays!
  - #808 - Fixed a bug that caused XMBC to be unable to save settings after the folder (that a previously loaded custom profile was in) was deleted.
  - #806 - Fixed the uninstaller so it can be run in silent mode with /S
  - #805 - Fixed a new issue (in 2.20.x) with Activate on Hover which fails to work for certain window types (popup/non scrolling).
  - #804 - Modified versions ox XMBC should log the fact, and strings should be protected from modification.
  - #803 - Fixed another Firefox scrolling issue, when remapping to WHEEL UP/WHEEL DOWN. Consolidated scrolling code so they all call the same function to do the window/class checks!
  - #802 - Add further logging around any call to set cursor speed, also log the cursor speed set in Windows when hooking the mouse (eg. resume from sleep) to diagnose random cursor speed changes.
  - #800 - Add ability to customise the Enhanced Pointer Precision threshold values used in Windows to affect acceleration (manually editing the XML settings until 2.21)
  - #799 - Fixed Win11 22H2 Volume scroll over taskbar broken by XMBC scroll window under cursor.
  - #791 - Further structural changes to try and prevent XMBC from crashing in the audio/volume manager when resuming from sleep, under certain (rare) circumstances. Also fixed a crash in 2.20.2 related to logging debug messages.
