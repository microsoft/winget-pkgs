ShortDescription: X-Mouse Button Control is a free tool for Windows that allows you to re-configure and expand the capabilities of your mouse.
Description: X-Mouse Button Control (XMBC) allows you to create application and window specific profiles. This in turn, allows you to re-configure your mouse behaviour for individual applications or windows. For each profile you can also configure up to 10 'layers' of different button configurations which you can switch between using hot-keys or mouse buttons.
