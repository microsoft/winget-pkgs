ShortDescription: X-Mouse Button Control is a free tool for Windows that allows you to re-configure and expand the capabilities of your mouse.
Description: X-Mouse Button Control (XMBC) allows you to create application and window specific profiles. This in turn, allows you to re-configure your mouse behaviour for individual applications or windows. For each profile you can also configure up to 10 'layers' of different button configurations which you can switch between using hot-keys or mouse buttons.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  - #792 - Fixed broken scroll window mapping commands introduced in 2.20
  - #791 - Further fixes to try and prevent XMBC from crashing in the audio/volume manager when resuming from sleep, under certain (rare) circumstances.
  - #790 - Show an error message when importing invalid application/window profile files, and when loading invalid settings files.
  - #789 - Scrolling 'Open With' list in Windows 11 22H2 does not work with scroll window under cursor.
  - #788 - Bug in SimKey Parser logged incorrect messages about invalid tokens which are actually valid!
  - #787 - Investigate further and fix/mitigate some more of the crashes in 2.19.2 and 2.20 (that resulted in bug reports sent to me).
  - #786 - New Abort button hold with HELD action does not save correctly.
  - #785 - XMBCUpdate filename should reflect actual version (and original filename) NOTE: This won't have any effect until upgrading FROM 2.20.1!
  After such a long interval between 2.19.2 and 2.20, I expected everything to go smoothly, but of course that was naive of me!
  I have had several useful crash reports sent to me offer the past week which I believe I have fixed with #787 & #791 (it remains to be confirmed), hopefully by a lack of such reports from 2.20.1!).
  I've also fixed a few issues introduced with the fix for firefox scrolling that may have broken scrolling elsewhere!
