ShortDescription: Communicate with serial devices and applications, automate workflow with scrips
Description: |-
  HHD Software Automated Serial Terminal is a software utility that allows you to send/receive data via COM ports in various formats and to automate communications using scripts. This program facilitates the development and debugging, reverse engineering, testing/analysis of serial applications and hardware devices that use RS232/RS422/RS485 serial interfaces. It allows both communication with modems, routers, GPS receivers/transmitters and debugging of communication protocols for sensors, robots, complex automated lines and other industrial equipment.
  You will find this Terminal extremely useful if you need to create automatic tests or simulate behavior of serial software applications and physical serial devices. It supports RS-232, RS-422, RS-485 legacy or PnP serial ports, software-based virtual serial ports, and all kinds of USB COM ports created by USB to serial adapters or USB-to-RS232 converter cables.
  Basic functionality includes sending bytes, text characters, non-ANSI/ASCII characters and files over a serial transmit line. It supports sending/receiving sequences of binary, hex, decimal, octal, float and double data as well as sending characters in virtually any encoding including ANSI, EBCDIC, ISO, OEM, ISCII, MAC, multi-byte UNICODE UTF-8, UTF-16 over a serial line. It supports all standard/non-standard Baud rates, Data bits, Stop bits, Parity (odd/even/mark/space), software XON/XOFF and hardware flow control. It also allows you to control auxiliary modem and handshaking lines (CTS, DSR, RI and CD), toggle RTS/DTR lines.
  The product's various editions also include features for sending Modbus protocol commands (ASCII/RTU Modbus requests/responses) and creating automated test tasks both from the UI and with the help of Serial Port Terminal API (supports JavaScript/TypeScript).
