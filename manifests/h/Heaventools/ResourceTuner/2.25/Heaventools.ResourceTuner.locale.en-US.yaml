ShortDescription: >
  Resource Tuner is a powerful software tool designed to help users customize
  their 32/64-bit Windows executables such as EXE, DLL, MUN, and others.
Description: |-
  Resource Tuner enables you to view, extract, add, replace, edit, and delete
  the embedded resources within executable files, including icons, strings,
  background images, pictures, sounds, dialogs, hot keys, and menus — all that
  make up the visual part of your Windows programs.

  Moreover, it allows you to change the properties of executable files,
  including their version information and manifest files, while allowing you to
  gather and edit any file information during research. The application also
  includes a search feature to quickly locate specific resources within a large
  number of executable files on your computer without the need for manual
  browsing through numerous files.

  In fact, it empowers you to add your own custom branding to an application,
  change dialog messages, customize toolbar actions, and so on without having
  access to the original source code. Resource Tuner offers exciting
  possibilities even if you aren't a programmer. It's a perfect fit for
  translators, software localization experts, tweakers, resource enthusiasts,
  and anyone else who wants a different look and feel for an application.
