ShortDescription: View, Edit, and Reverse Engineer EXE and DLL Files
Description: |-
  PE Explorer is the most feature-packed program for inspecting the inner workings
  of your own software, and more importantly, third party Windows applications and
  libraries for which you do not have source code. Designed for users focused on
  various types of software reverse-engineering, PE Explorer offers the powerful
  tools needed for detailed analysis and debugging.

  PE Explorer lets you open, view and edit a variety of different 32-bit Windows
  executable file types (also called PE files) ranging from the common, such as
  EXE, DLL and ActiveX Controls, to the less familiar types, such as DLL.MUN, SCR
  (Screensavers), CPL (Control Panel Applets), SYS, MSSTYLES, BPL, DPL, and more
  (including executable files that run on MS XBox platform).
