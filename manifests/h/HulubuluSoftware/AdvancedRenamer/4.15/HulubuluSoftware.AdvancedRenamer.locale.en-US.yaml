ShortDescription: Batch file renaming utility for Windows and Mac.
Description: |-
  Advanced Renamer is a program for renaming multiple files and folders at once. By configuring renaming methods the names can be manipulated in various ways.
  It is easy to set up a batch rename using multiple methods on a large amount of files. The 13 different methods enables you to change the names, and timestamps of files in one go. The files can also be copied or moved to new locations based on information in the files.
  With Advanced Renamer you can construct new file names by adding, removing, replacing, changing case, or giving the file a brand new name based on known information about the file.
  Before performing the operations on the files you can verify that the output will be correct and if you perform the rename and regret it, you can undo the complete batch.

  New tag: <Delimiter>

  If you have ever created a filename made from metadata values you might have experienced oddly looking filenames with repeated delimiters when some metadata values are empty. It could be a New Name pattern like this:
  <Title> - <Artist> - <Album> - <Year>
  If the Album value is empty, you end up with a filename like this:
  Heroes - David Bowie -  - 1977
  To prevent this, a new Delimiter tag has been added with special logic to not appear in the beginning or end of the filename and will not repeat. The tag can be used like this:
  <Title><Delimiter: - ><Artist><Delimiter: - ><Album><Delimiter: - ><Year>
  The result for the same case as above will be:
  Heroes - David Bowie - 1977
  The tag can also be used with the short syntax <-> to make it easier to type, and if all delimiters are the same, only the first has to be defined with a parameter:
  <Title><-: - ><Artist><-><Album><-><Year>
  Multiple delimiter parameters can be used in the the same pattern:
  <Title><-: - ><Artist><-><Album><-><Year><-><Track><-: of ><TrackCount>

  Short syntax for default and alternative tag values

  The new short syntax for default and alternative tag values makes it easier to use tags with multiple alternatives. Instead of using the long syntax like these:
  <Artist:default:Unknown artist>
  <Artist:alt:Performer>
  You can now use the short syntax with | like this:
  <Artist|Unknown artist>
  <Artist||Performer>
  Single pipe | is short for using the default tag modifier, which will default empty values to a string, and double pipe || is short for using the alt tag modifier, which will use the value of the alternative tag if available.
  As oppose to the syntax based on tag modifiers, the short syntax will always appear before any parameters, and parameters and tag modifiers will always be applied to the resolved tag value. Therefore, this syntax:
  <Artist||Performer|Unknown artist:lower>
  Is equivalent to this using tag modified:
  <Artist:lower:alt:Performer:lower:default:Unknown artist:lower>
