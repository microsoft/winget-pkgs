ShortDescription: Batch file renaming utility for Windows and Mac.
Description: |-
  Advanced Renamer is a program for renaming multiple files and folders at once. By configuring renaming methods the names can be manipulated in various ways.
  It is easy to set up a batch rename using multiple methods on a large amount of files. The 13 different methods enables you to change the names, and timestamps of files in one go. The files can also be copied or moved to new locations based on information in the files.
  With Advanced Renamer you can construct new file names by adding, removing, replacing, changing case, or giving the file a brand new name based on known information about the file.
  Before performing the operations on the files you can verify that the output will be correct and if you perform the rename and regret it, you can undo the complete batch.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  New column showing list index

  A new column has been added to the list showing the index of the item in the list. When using the List method to rename files the value of the index column will correspond to the line numbers in the text field.

  Set file timestamps to metadata value

  The Timestamp method can be used to set new file level timestamps, like created date and modified date. Now these values can also be set to the value of any timestamp metadata value embedded within any media file.

  File details moved to new location

  In the item details window, file level information has been moved to the same tables as other metadata values. Choose the item File in the group dropdown.

  See details of CSV Data import

  In Advanced Renamer file items can be enriched with values from a CSV file to be used with the <CSV:X> tag. To show the values imported for a file, select the newly added CSV in the group dropdown in the item details panel. It will show up after CSV values are imported. Select a value and click Copy tag and insert it into the renaming method of choice to use the value in the renaming batch.
