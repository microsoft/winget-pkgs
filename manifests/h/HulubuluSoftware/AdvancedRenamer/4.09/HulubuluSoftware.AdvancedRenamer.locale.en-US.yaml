ShortDescription: Batch file renaming utility for Windows and Mac.
Description: |-
  Advanced Renamer is a program for renaming multiple files and folders at once. By configuring renaming methods the names can be manipulated in various ways.
  It is easy to set up a batch rename using multiple methods on a large amount of files. The 13 different methods enables you to change the names, and timestamps of files in one go. The files can also be copied or moved to new locations based on information in the files.
  With Advanced Renamer you can construct new file names by adding, removing, replacing, changing case, or giving the file a brand new name based on known information about the file.
  Before performing the operations on the files you can verify that the output will be correct and if you perform the rename and regret it, you can undo the complete batch.

  Titlecase

  As an addition to uppercasing the first letter in every word, titlecase can be used to give a similar result, but with smaller connecting words like "and", "or", "the", "a", and "of" in lowercase. This is a common way to write movie, music, and book titles in English. In the settings window, you can choose which words to keep in lowercase when using titlecase. See Wikipedia article for more info.

  Stripes in list

  For better readability, the list can now be displayed with stripes. This is especially useful when working with long lists of files. The stripes can be enabled in the settings window.

  Method condition improvements

  The method conditions have been improved with new fields for matching path and name as a single string and match field to make the method condition only match if the field value is short or longer than a given value.
