ShortDescription: Batch file renaming utility for Windows and Mac.
Description: |-
  Advanced Renamer is a program for renaming multiple files and folders at once. By configuring renaming methods the names can be manipulated in various ways.
  It is easy to set up a batch rename using multiple methods on a large amount of files. The 13 different methods enables you to change the names, and timestamps of files in one go. The files can also be copied or moved to new locations based on information in the files.
  With Advanced Renamer you can construct new file names by adding, removing, replacing, changing case, or giving the file a brand new name based on known information about the file.
  Before performing the operations on the files you can verify that the output will be correct and if you perform the rename and regret it, you can undo the complete batch.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Metadata writer is back

  The ability to change metadata values is the last large feature missing fra version 3.95 and now it has finally returned. It works the same way as in 3.95 and it still uses Exiftool under the hood to change metdata in image, video, and audio files. A couple of improvements has been added, like the ability to change values from the item details panel, when the Exiftool group is selected.
  Remember, not all formats and fields are supported. The program will automatically adapt based on file extension and selected metadata field.

  Import data in Script method

  The Script method now has the ability to import data from an external file through the readFileText() and readFileLines() functions. This makes it possible to create scripts that can read data from external files and use that data to rename files. By default, the program will only read from CSV, JSON and text files, but this can be changed in the settings window.

  At the same time the tags <File Content> and <File Line> is now considered deprecated and will be removed at some time in the future. The tags are too complex for tag based renaming. The functionality is best acheived through scripting instead.

  Learn more about the new import functionality in the user guide.

  Apply script shortcut

  It has now become easier to apply a new script. Instead of reaching for the mouse to click the Apply button, you can now use the keyboard shortcut instead.

  Windows shortcut: Ctrl + Enter
  Mac shortcut: âŒ˜Enter

  Pattern location in Remove method

  If you want to remove a pattern from the beginning or end of a filename, you had to use regular expressions, but not everyone is comfortable using regex. An option to specify where the pattern should be located has been added, which works even without regular expressions. Use it to remove a pattern from the start or end of a filename. The option can be used when the remove type is set to Pattern, Word characters, Non-word characters, Numbers, or Not numbers.
