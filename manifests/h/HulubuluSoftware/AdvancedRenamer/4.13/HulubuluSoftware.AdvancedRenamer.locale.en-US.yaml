ShortDescription: Batch file renaming utility for Windows and Mac.
Description: |-
  Advanced Renamer is a program for renaming multiple files and folders at once. By configuring renaming methods the names can be manipulated in various ways.
  It is easy to set up a batch rename using multiple methods on a large amount of files. The 13 different methods enables you to change the names, and timestamps of files in one go. The files can also be copied or moved to new locations based on information in the files.
  With Advanced Renamer you can construct new file names by adding, removing, replacing, changing case, or giving the file a brand new name based on known information about the file.
  Before performing the operations on the files you can verify that the output will be correct and if you perform the rename and regret it, you can undo the complete batch.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Move, Delete, or Rename existing target files

  When setting up a renaming batch you might end up with the error "File already exists". This can be most common when moving or copying files to a new location. It has been requested that the program should have an option to overwrite existing files, but that makes it difficult to undo a batch properly. Instead you will now have these three options, before starting the batch:
  - Move existing files to a new location
  - Move existing files to recycle bin
  - Rename existing files
  The buttons will show automatically in panel in the bottom of the main window, when at least one item has the "File already exists" error.
  When renaming or moving files with this feature, the program will use Advanced Renamer technology to produce the new names and file paths, which means you can use the same tags as in a standard renaming batch and you can even revert the action.
  Note, this only works for files, not folders.

  Export list, including all metadata

  A new window for exporting the file list has been added, with many more options. As always you can export to text and CSV file, but now you can also export to JSON format. There are plenty of options for how the program should format the output and which encoding to use. You can choose to export the columns of the item list as it is or export all metadata found in the files.
  A later version will extend the support for importing files and enriching the list of files with more data from external sources.
