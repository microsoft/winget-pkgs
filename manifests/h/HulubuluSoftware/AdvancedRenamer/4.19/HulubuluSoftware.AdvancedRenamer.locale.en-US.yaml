ShortDescription: Batch file renaming utility for Windows and Mac.
Description: |-
  Advanced Renamer is a program for renaming multiple files and folders at once. By configuring renaming methods the names can be manipulated in various ways.
  It is easy to set up a batch rename using multiple methods on a large amount of files. The 13 different methods enables you to change the names, and timestamps of files in one go. The files can also be copied or moved to new locations based on information in the files.
  With Advanced Renamer you can construct new file names by adding, removing, replacing, changing case, or giving the file a brand new name based on known information about the file.
  Before performing the operations on the files you can verify that the output will be correct and if you perform the rename and regret it, you can undo the complete batch.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Changes to metadata writer

  The user interface for the metadata batch writer has changed to better support large batches. The user interface is not more compact and performs better when many files are shown in the list.

  You can now also use tags when setting metadata values. This makes it possible to set metadata values based on other metadata values or file properties.

  Name collision rule improvements

  A new Name Collision rule has been added called Append Character. It works in the same way as Append Number, but instead of appending a number to make the filename unique, it will append characters (A, B, C, ..., Z, AA, AB, etc), like the <Inc Alpha> tag.

  The Append Number rule now has a new option to start from a custom number instead of 1. To force a specific number length, append zeros, like this to get a 4 digit number: 0001.
