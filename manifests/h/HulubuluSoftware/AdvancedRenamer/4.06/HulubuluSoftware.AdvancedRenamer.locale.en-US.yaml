ShortDescription: Batch file renaming utility for Windows and Mac.
Description: |-
  Advanced Renamer is a program for renaming multiple files and folders at once. By configuring renaming methods the names can be manipulated in various ways.
  It is easy to set up a batch rename using multiple methods on a large amount of files. The 13 different methods enables you to change the names, and timestamps of files in one go. The files can also be copied or moved to new locations based on information in the files.
  With Advanced Renamer you can construct new file names by adding, removing, replacing, changing case, or giving the file a brand new name based on known information about the file.
  Before performing the operations on the files you can verify that the output will be correct and if you perform the rename and regret it, you can undo the complete batch.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  MediaType tag

  Use the tag <MediaType> do get the media type group name. Advanced Renamer groups files into 5 categories. Use this tag to extract this value. The media type is determined by the file extension and is not based on the actual content. Possible valures are: image, audio, video, document, and other

  "Now" option added to Timestamp method

  Use the "Now" option in the Timestamp method to quickly set the timestamp to the current date and time. This is faster than setting the same value with the absolute date and time option.

  Read metadata from font files

  For the first time, Advanced Renamer gets support for reading metadata from font files. The supported file types are .ttf and .otf.

  Recognize any date and time metadata value

  If the name of a meta data value contain the words tdate or time, it can be parsed and used as a regular timestamp value, by adding a second parameter for the format, like yyyy-mm-dd_hh_nn_ss. You can even adjust the timestamp value with the adjustment parameter added in version 4.04.
