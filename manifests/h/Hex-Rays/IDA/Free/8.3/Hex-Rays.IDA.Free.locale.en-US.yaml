ShortDescription: The free binary code analysis tool to kickstart your reverse engineering experience.
Description: This (completely!) free version of IDA offers a privilege opportunity to see IDA in action. This light but powerful tool can quickly analyze the binary code samples and users can save and look closer at the analysis results.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  IDA64 support for (32-bit) .idb files
  We have further improved IDA64 so that it can be a complete replacement for the legacy 32-bit IDA in all situations. To ease the migration, we implemented a feature to convert the legacy .idb databases to .i64 ones (codenamed CVT64).
  The 32-bit IDA is now considered deprecated and will likely go away at some point.

  UX improvements
  Improved UI performance on some strategic fronts. For example, slower autoanalysis of Dyld Shared Cache's due to the "Functions" window (whether filtered or not) is a thing of the past.

  IDA Teams
  - It is now possible to specify a (HTTP CONNECT-style) proxy for connecting to the Vault server.
  - During a merging session, you can pick a chunk to resolve a conflict using context menu instead of the toolbar.
  - The licensing logic was improved:
    - Previously, when some licenses expired, the Vault server would refuse to work until the number of users was reduced to the count of the active licenses. Now it will continue working but simply refuse new license checkouts in such situation.
    - IDA was relying on the local ida.key file and displaying the expiration date from it, even if the license was updated on Vault server. Now IDA Teams does not use the local ida.key at all but only information from the server.

  IDA Educational
  Our free offer for educational institutions gained a cloud decompiler for x86/x64 and the file size limit has been lifted.

  IDA Home
  The decompiler's IDA Python API (ida_hexrays module) now works with the cloud decompilers available in IDA Home

  Processor module improvements
  - PPC processor module gained support for the LSP extension, as well as the new Power ISA 3.1 instructions
  - ARM module now shows symbolic names for well-known ARM64 system registers
  - MIPS and RISC-V modules have improved register value tracking which should lead to better analysis and more discovered cross-references
  - DEX module and loader now support the new features added in the DEX 039 format (Android 9 and 10)
  - PC: instructions with three or more operands (such as imul or vinsertps) can support properly distinct types for each operand. In fact, this applies to instructions with three or more operands in all processors.

  Loaders
  - ESP: a new loader, supporting the common file format used for the Espressif ESP line of chips
  - Cortex-M: a new loader for Cortex-M raw binary firmware, supports ARMv6-M to ARMv8-M and load base autodetection
  - ELF: the loader now parses PPC-specific sections with details about the instruction set used, and configures the processor module automatically

  Plugins
  - golang: added support for Go 1.20 and improved detection and parsing of Go metadata
  - Goomba, our open-source plugin for MBA deobfuscation is now shipped as part of IDA
  - DWARF: loading of DWARF debug information has been sped up significantly, especially for big files
  - OBJC: added support for Objective-C optimizations introduced in iOS16 (stubs for objc_msgSend with common selectors and custom wrappers for retain/release)

  Decompiler
  - it is now possible to disable some optional optimizations performed by default. This may be useful for plugin writers doing their own analysis on microcode
  - multiple fixes were done for the outlined functions support initially introduced in 8.2
  - improved detection of call arguments in multiple situation, including detection of return value passed via X8 on ARM64
