ShortDescription: Unofficial development project for the HASS.Agent platform.
Moniker: hass.agent
ReleaseNotes: |-
  Breaking changes, please read below.
  Due to security concerns, we were forced to remove Libre Hardware Monitor library that allowed HASS.Agent to access hardware information. The breaking change in this is that starting with this release, the GPU Temperature Sensor is non-functioning.
  It has been left present for backward compatibility reasons, however it will always return 0.
  Please see the awesome writeup by @DarkAutumn for more details #43 (comment)
  Please see Docs for how you can get GPU temperature information using the standalone version of Libre Hardware Monitor.
  Some changes, some fixes and hopefully not a lot of bugs :)
