  IMPORTANT (UNSIGNED APPS): After the move under the Kubernetes SIG UI, we are still finishing some last details on how to sign new releases. So the Windows and Mac desktop versions are not signed/notarized. When running on Windows, you have to choose "More > Run Anyway" when the OS warns you that the application is not signed. On Mac, you have to install the app and then Ctrl+Click it to choose Open from the context menu and then choose to Open the app after the warning. Once we have a way to sign the apps, we will re-upload the assets.
  We appreciate your patience while we solve this issue.
