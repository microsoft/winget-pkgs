ShortDescription: Open Source API Development Ecosystem
Description: |-
  The Hoppscotch desktop app has unlocked a lot of possibilities for what we can achieve. Some potential possibilities include local file-based workspaces and making the desktop app interact with Hoppscotch Cloud as well as your own self-hosted instance of Hoppscotch.

  Hoppscotch Desktop App is set to redefine how you work with APIs. We invite you to explore and experience the speed and efficiency it offers. Let's embark on this new chapter together and revolutionize the way you interact with APIs.
