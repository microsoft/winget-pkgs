ShortDescription: The Universal Binary Installer
Description: |-
  UBI is a universal binary installer library and CLI tool.
  When I say "universal", I mean it downloads binaries from GitHub or GitLab releases.
  When I say "binary", I mean it handles single-file executables like those created by most Go and Rust projects.
  When I say "installer", I mean it plops the binary wherever you tell it to.
  And finally, when I say "UBI", I don't mean "universal basic income", but that'd be nice too.
Tags:

- portable
ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Upgraded the dependency on zip to 2.4.1. Previously, ubi pinned zip 2.2.3, which was yanked,
    because the 2.3.0 release broke ubi's tests.
