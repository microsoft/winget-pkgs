ShortDescription: The Universal Binary Installer
Description: |-
  UBI is a universal binary installer library and CLI tool.
  When I say "universal", I mean it downloads binaries from GitHub or GitLab releases.
  When I say "binary", I mean it handles single-file executables like those created by most Go and Rust projects.
  When I say "installer", I mean it plops the binary wherever you tell it to.
  And finally, when I say "UBI", I don't mean "universal basic income", but that'd be nice too.
Tags:
- binary
- download
- executable
- install
- portable
ReleaseNotes: |-
  - This is identical to 0.5.1, but it was necessary to work around a bug in my GitHub release
    automation. The 0.5.1 is no longer available on GitHub, but the crates.io releases still exist and
    there's no issue with using them.
