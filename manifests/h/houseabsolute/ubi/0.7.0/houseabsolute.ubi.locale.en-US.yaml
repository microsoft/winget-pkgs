ShortDescription: The Universal Binary Installer
Description: |-
  UBI is a universal binary installer library and CLI tool.
  When I say "universal", I mean it downloads binaries from GitHub or GitLab releases.
  When I say "binary", I mean it handles single-file executables like those created by most Go and Rust projects.
  When I say "installer", I mean it plops the binary wherever you tell it to.
  And finally, when I say "UBI", I don't mean "universal basic income", but that'd be nice too.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Added a new --matching-regex CLI flag and UbiBuilder::matching_regex method. This regex is
    matched against potential release filenames before attempting to find a release with a matching
    OS, architecture, etc. This is useful for doing things like filtering for a single tool when a
    project releases multiple tools in a single GitHub release. PR by @yjoer (Yeoh Joer). GH #122.
  - The logic for determining whether or not to include a top-level directory when --extract-all is
    passed has been fixed. Previously, if the directory where the archive was extracted into was not
    empty, then when ubi checked for whether it should ignore a top-level directory in the archive,
    it would see these files, and never ignore the top-level directory. Now it extracts the archive
    into a temp directory and checks that. This makes the behavior of --extract-all more
    predictable, and it means you can use to, for example, extract an archive into an existing tree,
    like ~/.local, that contains ~/.local/bin, ~/.local/share, etc. Reported by @jinnatar (Jinna
    Kiisuo). GH #106.
  - Changed dependency declarations to mostly eliminate default features, which removed quite a few
    transitive dependencies.
