ShortDescription: The Universal Binary Installer
Description: |-
  UBI is a universal binary installer library and CLI tool.
  When I say "universal", I mean it downloads binaries from GitHub or GitLab releases.
  When I say "binary", I mean it handles single-file executables like those created by most Go and Rust projects.
  When I say "installer", I mean it plops the binary wherever you tell it to.
  And finally, when I say "UBI", I don't mean "universal basic income", but that'd be nice too.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Fixed a bug introduced in 0.8.0, which caused ubi to prefer the browser_download_url over the url for a GitHub asset. When both are present, it will now use the url field. This is important because when downloading assets from a private repo, the url will work with the authentication headers that ubi sets. Fixed by @rnaveiras (Ra√∫l Naveiras). GH #139.
  - Added more context to errors and made ubi display the full error context when it fails. This should help with debugging issues like #136.
