ShortDescription: The Universal Binary Installer
Description: |-
  UBI is a universal binary installer library and CLI tool.
  When I say "universal", I mean it downloads binaries from GitHub or GitLab releases.
  When I say "binary", I mean it handles single-file executables like those created by most Go and Rust projects.
  When I say "installer", I mean it plops the binary wherever you tell it to.
  And finally, when I say "UBI", I don't mean "universal basic income", but that'd be nice too.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Added support for 7-Zip archive (\.7z). Based on PR #115130 from @yjoer (Yeoh Joer).
  - Added support for projects on GitLab with more than one slash in the path name, like
    https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/terra-transformer. GitLab allows for more path components
    in project names, unlike GitHub. Based on PR #115 from @suprememoocow (Andrew Newdigate).
  - Added support for release artifacts with .sh and .py extension. Based on PR #127 from
    @Finkregh (Oluf Lorenzen ).
