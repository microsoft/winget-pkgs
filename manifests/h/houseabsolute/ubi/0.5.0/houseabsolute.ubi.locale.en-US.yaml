ShortDescription: The Universal Binary Installer
Description: |-
  UBI is a universal binary installer library and CLI tool.
  When I say "universal", I mean it downloads binaries from GitHub or GitLab releases.
  When I say "binary", I mean it handles single-file executables like those created by most Go and Rust projects.
  When I say "installer", I mean it plops the binary wherever you tell it to.
  And finally, when I say "UBI", I don't mean "universal basic income", but that'd be nice too.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  - On Windows, ubi now looks for files with .bat extensions as an executable. This applies both
    to releases of standalone files and executables in an archive file (tarball or zip). Based on work
    by @timothysparg (Tim Sparg) in PR #97.
  - If there are no files that are an exact match for the project name in an archive file, ubi will
    now look for files that start with the project name. On non-Windows, boxes, this will only match
    executables. On Windows, this will only match .bat or .exe files. Based on work by
    @timothysparg (Tim Sparg) in PR #97.
