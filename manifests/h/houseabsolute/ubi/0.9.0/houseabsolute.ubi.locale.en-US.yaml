ShortDescription: The Universal Binary Installer
Description: |-
  UBI is a universal binary installer library and CLI tool.
  When I say "universal", I mean it downloads binaries from GitHub or GitLab releases.
  When I say "binary", I mean it handles single-file executables like those created by most Go and Rust projects.
  When I say "installer", I mean it plops the binary wherever you tell it to.
  And finally, when I say "UBI", I don't mean "universal basic income", but that'd be nice too.

ReleaseNotes: "- Added a new --min-age-days flag that tells ubi to only consider releases at least that old. This is useful for mitigating supply chain attacks, especially for projects that use GitHub's immutable releases feature. GH #145."
