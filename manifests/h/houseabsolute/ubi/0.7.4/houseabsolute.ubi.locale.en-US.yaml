ShortDescription: The Universal Binary Installer
Description: |-
  UBI is a universal binary installer library and CLI tool.
  When I say "universal", I mean it downloads binaries from GitHub or GitLab releases.
  When I say "binary", I mean it handles single-file executables like those created by most Go and Rust projects.
  When I say "installer", I mean it plops the binary wherever you tell it to.
  And finally, when I say "UBI", I don't mean "universal basic income", but that'd be nice too.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Changed macOS on ARM artifact name matching to look for "arm", not just "arm64", before looking for 64-bit names. This means that ubi will pick something like "foo-macos-arm.tgz" over "foo-macos-x86-64.tgz" on the macOS ARM platform. Implemented by !itochan (Kazunori Jo). GH #132.
  - Added support for Zstd compression with both standalone files and tarballs. Implemented by @alaviss. GH #134.
  - Fixed handling of the --rename-exe-to option. For some file types, like .AppImage files, this would preserve the extension on the file even if the value passed to --rename-exe-to did not include the extension. This contradicted the documentation, which said that the name was used as given. Reported by @pale3(Marko Rakamaric). GH #129.
  - Fixed regressions introduced in 0.7.0 by eliminating default features for clap, which made the CLI experience generally worse.
