ReleaseNotes: |
  - Release date 9/15/2023, sp149392
  - Fixes miscellaneous issues.
  - Fixes issues that cause large memory consumption on certain computer systems.
  - Updates certain notifications and error messages.
  - Updates to recommendations for unsupported Operating Systems.
  - Updates the TLS configuration.
  - New command line error return codes:
    - 4104: Returned when HPIA cannot find a supported Operating System for a platform, so a
      "generic" reference file for analyze and recommendations is used.
      - This return code takes precedence over other possible return codes, like 3010 or 3020. It
        will not take precedence over return codes based on things like network errors, bad
        parameters, etc.
      - If the desire is to see the 3010 or 3020 return codes, vs the 4104 return code, then the
        new error switch /IgnoreGenericOsError must be used. The switch /IgnoreGenericOsError will
        tell HPIA to return the normal return code instead of the new 4104 return code.
    - 3011: Returned when attempting to install non-SSM compliant SoftPaqs.
      - Additionally, there will be a message in the debug log: "The following softpaq cannot be
        installed via a script - spxxxxx sofpaq title".
      - Related to this functionality, during /AutoReport, the .csv file generated has been updated
        with verbiage that is clearer on SSM vs non-SSM compliant SoftPaq install status. A new
        property was added to the .csv: "AutoInstallable", which will be either TRUE or FALSE.
    - 4102: Returned when a secure connection error occurs. TLS 1.2 or higher is needed.
