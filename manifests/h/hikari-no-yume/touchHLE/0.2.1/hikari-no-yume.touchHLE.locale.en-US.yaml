ShortDescription: High-level emulator for iPhone OS apps
ReleaseNotes: |-
  - From this release onwards, the old list of supported apps is replaced by the new, crowdsourced touchHLE app compatibility database.
  - In case you missed it, the touchHLE app archive was recently launched.
    It only has one app at the moment, but that's hopefully just the start.
    If you were an indie developer in the early iPhone days, please get in touch!
  - If you want to get notified about future releases, you might want to join the Discord server.
    You can't post there, but you'll be @'d with updates.
    There's also a YouTube channel where I post short gameplay videos with new releases.
  - If you want to help me keep working on this full time, please consider supporting me financially.
  - API support improvements:
  - Various small contributions. (@hikari-no-yume, @ciciplusplus, @alborrajo)
  - New working apps:
  - Doom (@ciciplusplus)
  - Doom II RPG (@alborrajo)
  - I Love Katamari (@ciciplusplus)
  - Wolfenstein RPG (@alborrajo)
  - Multi-touch is now supported. (@ciciplusplus)
  - The Android version of touchHLE now has a _documents provider_.
    Thanks to a mere three hundred lines of boilerplate code originally written for the emulator Skyline (RIP), it is now possible for you, as the owner of a device running a newer Android version, to move files _documents_ in and out of touchHLE's directory _location_ on your device with relative ease.
    For example, it is now possible to download an .ipa file _application/octet-stream document_ to the Downloads folder of your device, then, using an appropriate app, move this _document_ to the touchHLE _location_.
    Users of normal operating systems and older versions of Android continue to be able to access a superior version of the same functionality via a so-called “file manager”. (@hikari-no-yume)
  - There is now an “Open file manager” button in the app picker, to make it easier to find where touchHLE stores your apps and settings.
    On most operating systems this opens the relevant directory in a file manager, and on Android it opens some sort of app for managing _documents_ in the touchHLE _location_. (@hikari-no-yume)
  - The Android version of touchHLE now writes all log messages to a file called log.txt, in addition to outputting them to logcat. (@hikari-no-yume)
  - The new --stabilize-virtual-cursor= option makes the analog stick-controlled virtual cursor appear more stable to the emulated app, which is helpful in some games with overly sensitive menu scrolling.
    In some titles it is applied by default. (@hikari-no-yume; special thanks: @wareya)
  - Automatic language detection now works on all platforms, and supports a list of languages in order of preference, rather than just one.
    The LANG environment variable is no longer supported, and instead the new --preferred-languages= option can be used.
    Note that it is the emulated app itself that decides what to do with this list, and whether particular languages are supported. (@hikari-no-yume)
  - The app picker now has multiple pages, so it is no longer limited to 16 apps. (@hikari-no-yume)
  - The framerate is now limited to 60fps by default, which matches the original iPhone OS and fixes issues with some games where the game ran too fast or consumed excessive energy and CPU time.
    This limit can be adjusted or disabled with the new --limit-fps= option. (@hikari-no-yume; special thanks: @wareya)
  - The --button-to-touch= option now supports D-pad mappings in addition to the A/B/X/Y buttons. (@alborrajo)
  - Default game controller button mappings have been added for Wolfenstein RPG and Doom II RPG, including for the D-pad. (@alborrajo)
