Description: |-
  The software implements a DHCP/BOOTP Server based on RFC 2131. Besides the standard dynamic IP address assignment for clients the software supports the assignment of predefined profiles and static IP addresses to known hardware addresses or identifiers.

  The server includes a multithreaded TFTP server for secure and reliable downloads.

  The server supports all DHCP/BOOTP options and has no limitation in the number of clients.
  On multi homed servers the software can handle up to 32 interfaces with one dynamic IP address pool per interface IP address.

  User interface in English and German.

  Address and parameter assignment can be based on:
  - hardware address
  - hardware address range (e.g. vendor bytes of MAC address)
  - Server interface
  - Client identifier
  - Vendor or User class (as specified in RFC 3004)
  - Relay IP address
  - Relay Agent Information (as specified in RFC 3046) including support of normal and trusted server interfaces.
  - The DHCP Server is implemented as a native service for background operation, A Control Panel applet provides interactive access to the service.

  The software is shareware.
