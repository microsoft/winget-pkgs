ShortDescription: Detect It Easy, or abbreviated DIE is a program for determining types of files.
Description: |-
  Detect It Easy (DiE) is a powerful tool for file type identification, popular among malware analysts, cybersecurity experts, and reverse engineers worldwide. Supporting both signature-based and heuristic analysis, DiE enables efficient file inspections across a broad range of platforms, including Windows, Linux, and MacOS. Its adaptable, script-driven detection architecture makes it one of the most versatile tools in the field, with a comprehensive list of supported OS images.

  Detect It Easy’s flexible signature system and scripting capabilities make it an essential tool for malware analysis and digital forensics. With traditional static analyzers often limited in scope and prone to false positives, DiE’s customizable design enables precise integration of new detection logic, ensuring reliable results across diverse file types.
