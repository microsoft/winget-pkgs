ReleaseNotes: |-
  ✨ Enhancements
  - 📙 New documentation site — quickly access it via the Help menu (httpie.io/docs/desktop)
  - ♻️ New sync protocol — groundwork for upcoming multiplayer mode
  - 🚜 Selective field merging — changes are now applied on the field level, not doc level
  - ✌️ Conflict resolution — auto-merging of changes made across clients (same-field conflicts stay last-write-wins for now)
  - 🚀 Much faster initial sync — up to 20 times fewer requests
  - 💁‍♀️ Startup feedback — understand what the app is doing during longer operation
  - 🛫 ⌘R to send request — don’t fight your muscle memory (desktop-only, #36)
  🪲 Bug fixes
  - Fixed search & filter keyboard shortcuts (⌘F and ⇧⌘F) to always focus the input field (#133)
  - Fixed cursor jumping in search, replace, and filter fields when typing from start/middle
  - Fixed search from selection
  - Fixed missing params in cURL and HTTPie export
  - Fixed Bearer auth token sent as param instead of header under some circumstances (#103)
