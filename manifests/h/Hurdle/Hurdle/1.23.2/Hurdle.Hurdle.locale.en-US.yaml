ShortDescription: Simply deliver better software training online using hurdle's digital classroom
Description: hurdle is an online, live training platform built to mimic the classroom and is designed by professional system trainers. Offering inclusivity regardless of location, all learners can experience the same learning experience they would in a classroom, remotely. As trainers ourselves we understand the need for students to be confident in what they have learnt, and hurdle gives the ability for them to be demonstrated to and practice with the trainer being able to support by seeing exactly what the entire class is doing on their screen in real time.
