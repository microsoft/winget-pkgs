ShortDescription: 'A Local-first chat analysis tool: Relive your social memories powered by SQL and AI Agents.'
Description: |-
  ChatLab is a free, open-source, and local-first application dedicated to analyzing chat records. Through an AI Agent and a flexible SQL engine, you can freely dissect, query, and even reconstruct your social data.
  We refuse to upload your privacy to the cloud; instead, we bring powerful analytics directly to your computer.
  Currently supported: Chat record analysis for LINE, WeChat, QQ, WhatsApp, Instagram and Discord. Upcoming support: Messenger, iMessage.
  The project is still in early iteration, so there are many bugs and unfinished features. If you encounter any issues, feel free to provide feedback.
  Core Features
  - 🚀 Ultimate Performance: Utilizing stream computing and multi-threaded parallel architecture, it maintains fluid interaction and response even with millions of chat records.
  - 🔒 Privacy Protection: Chat records and configurations are stored in your local database, and all analysis is performed locally (with the exception of AI features).
  - 🤖 Intelligent AI Agent: Integrated with 10+ Function Calling tools and supporting dynamic scheduling to deeply excavate interesting insights from chat records.
  - 📊 Multi-dimensional Data Visualization: Provides intuitive analysis charts for activity trends, time distribution patterns, member rankings, and more.
  - 🧩 Format Standardization: Through a powerful data abstraction layer, it bridges the format differences between various chat applications, allowing any chat records to be analyzed.
