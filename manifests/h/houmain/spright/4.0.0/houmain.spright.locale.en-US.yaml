ReleaseNotes: |-
  Changed
  - Renamed *-bounds definitions to *-size.
  - Changed meaning of rect in the output description. It used to be the logical bounds of the sprite. Now it is the rectangle the sprite takes on the sheet (which can be bigger than trimmedRect, when the size is increased by min-size, divisible-size, common-size).
  - The logical bounds of a sprite can now be defined by a margin, which is added to rect.
  - Renamed vertices to outline in output description and made it relative to rect (it used to be relative to the trimmedRect).
  Added
  - Added margin definition.
  - Added the sheets' outputs to description.
  Fixed
  - Fixed divisible-width.
  - Fixed trimmedSourceRect in description when transforming.
  - Fixed align-pivot when anchor is not top/left.
  - Fixed alignment when sprite is rotated.
  - Fixed extrude and uncropped pivot-point.
  - Fixed scale when downsampling to nearest.
  - Improved rotate accuracy.
  - Fixed trim convex.
  - Fixed crash on duplicate before first sprite.
  - Prevent grid/atlas in input sequences.
  - Ensuring invalid definitions do not lead to invalid states.
