ShortDescription: A cross-platform context-aware key remapper
ReleaseNotes: |-
  Added
  - _Not_-key following key in input expression matches when key is released. e.g.
    Space{A !
    A} >> Control{A}
  Changed
  - No longer implicitly waiting for key release before timeout. e.g.
    A !250ms B. Previously the timeout started when A was released, now it starts when it is pressed.
    A !A !100ms B is needed to get the old behaviour.
  - Prevent input sequences without key down. e.g. !
    A 500ms
