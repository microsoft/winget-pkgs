ReleaseNotes: |-
  The reason for the major version number increment is mainly because of the changed behavior of ;. Up until 4.9 it was documented to start comments like #. Otherwise all configurations should work like before.
  Added
  - Allow to separate multiple mappings on one line with ;. This is useful for macros which generate multiple mappings. e.g.:
    swap = $0 >> $1 ; $1 >> $0
    swap[Y, Z]
  - Allow to add mappings for inputs which are released. e.g.:
    # trigger when A is released
    !A >> B
    # trigger when B is released while A is held
    A{!B} >> C
    # trigger when B is released while A is NOT held
    !A !B >> C
  - Toggling virtual keys can also have immediate effects. Using them as modifiers is toggling them twice:
    # toggle Virtual1 before and after pressing B
    # this effectively maps D to A B C
    Virtual1 >> A ^ C
    D >> Virtual1{B}
    # {} may also be empty. This maps C to A B
    Virtual2 >> B
    Virtual1 >> A Virtual2{}
    C >> Virtual1{}
  - Automatically replace Virtual with an unused virtual key. e.g.:
    # assign different virtual keys to VimMode and CapsWord
    VimMode = Virtual
    CapsWord = Virtual
  - Added keymapperctl operation --notify for showing notifications (#282). e.g.:
    notify = $(keymapperctl --notify "$0")
    F1 >> notify["Test"]
  - Added toggle-active directive, which allows to set a sequence that de-/activates keymapper (#283). e.g.:
    @toggle-active ScrollLock
  - Added include-optional directive, which includes a file but does not fail when file does not exist.
  Fixed
  - Fixed suppressed modifiers getting reapplied (#291).
  - Fixed loading config from "%HOME%\.config\keymapper" on Windows (#292).
  - Properly releasing keys when UAC prompt appeared on Windows.
