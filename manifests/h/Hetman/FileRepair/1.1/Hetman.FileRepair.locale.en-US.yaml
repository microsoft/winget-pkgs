Description: |-
  File Repair™ can fix files that are corrupted or incomplete, repairing files that come out damaged after a data recovery session.

  The tool can repair file headers and rebuild internal structures of many types of files. By fixing these errors, File Repair™ enables you to access those files, view and edit the images.

  - Repairs corrupted *.JPEG, *.JPG, *.JPE, and *.JFIF files in lossless mode. The repair is performed at block level without re-encoding the file, thus the original JPEG quality is preserved. Both main and thumbnail images are rebuilt. EXIF information is preserved.
  - Repairs damaged and corrupted files in the TIFF format including *.TIFF *.TIF, *.FAX, *.G3, and *.G4. File Repair™ supports Windows and Mac TIFF images, and can successfully repair uncompressed files and TIFF images compressed with LZW, JPEG, PackBit, CCITT 1D 2, Group 3 Fax 3 and Group 4 Fax algorithms.
  - Repairs raster images in *.PNG, *.BMP, *.DIB, and *.RLE formats. LZ77-compressed PNG files are supported. The tool can extract BMP images from resource files. File Repair™ repairs PNG images preserving the original visual quality and without re-compressing the files.
