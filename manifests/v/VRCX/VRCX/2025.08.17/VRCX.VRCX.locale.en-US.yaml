ReleaseNotes: |-
  macOS support has been added in this release, we don't plan on adding support for gameLog parsing ourselves although PR's are still welcome, I don't think anyone is playing VRChat on a mac, at least you'd hope not for their own sake.
  Thanks to @rs189 and @i0ntempest for making this possible.
  VRCX has undergone a ginormous codebase refactor this release thanks to @Map1en, PR submissions should be easier than ever.
  Additions
  - Add back friend order from API.
  - Application start time and loading friends list has sped up a lot.
  - Popcorn Palace "Now Playing" Discord RPC support, thanks to @Miner28.
  - New darkblue and amoled themes (2fea5f2), (#1315).
  - Open bio/group VRC links with VRCX.
  - Add Thai localization (#1294).
  Changes
  - Discord RPC changes.
    - Quest standalone mode support.
    - Clicking on world name will open VRChat world URL (only for public worlds).
    - Remove party details showing "1 of 1" when player count is disabled.
  - Screenshot metadata changes.
    - VRChat metadata can now be parsed alongside VRCX metadata (VRC metadata will override VRCX for applicable fields on the assumption it's more "trustworthy").
    - Should be faster at searching through photos.
    - Add metadata removal buttons, per image and for all images.
  - Clean up age verified user tags.
  - Change user dialog platform to show current platform rather than last platform.
  - Trigger BlockedOnPlayerJoined when joining an instance.
  - Changed VRC registry auto backup interval, auto backup every 3 days, auto delete backups that are over 2 weeks old.
  - Remove PWI (https://github.com/vrcx-team/VRCX/wiki/World-Persistence-(PWI)).
  - Change theme handling to support element-ui scss variables (https://github.com/vrcx-team/VRCX/wiki/Themes#custom-theme-with-element-ui-scss-variables).
  - Update Cef to 138.0.340.
  Fixes
  - Fix hidden VRC+ badge.
  - Fix avatar/world cache size.
  - Fix VRCX not opening after downgrading.
  - Fix same instance being shown as "private".
  - Fix friend in same instance on orange being showing twice in friends list.
  - Fix playerList tab being still populated after restarting VRCX.
  - Fix groupDialog set representing button showing group as representing when it wasn't.
  - Clicking links in DevConsole will no longer cause you to leave the main app webpage.
  Linux (Electron)
  - Include dotnet runtime in the appimage (#1289).
  - Add SteamVR OpenVR overlay (#1299).
  - Fix that GTK error (#1297).
  - Remove wine support for Cef.
  - Many other small fixes.
  - Update Electron to 37.2.5.
