ReleaseNotes: |-
  Additions
  - New "tools" tab.
    - Add Group Calendar timeline, proper calendar in next release.
    - We're going to start slowly moving stuff from settings into the new "tools" tab, this should help clean things up and increase discoverability of these features.
    - We'll keep the old buttons around to redirect to the tools tab to help with not getting lost in the menus.
  - Add Discord RPC options.
    - Toggle displaying current platform, it now works with Mobile platforms.
    - Toggle world integration.
    - Toggle "Display world name as Discord status", defaulted to disabled.
  - Open instance in-game instead of self invite while VRChat is running. If it fails it will automatically fallback to self invite, if you still prefer self invite, a setting was added to disable this feature.
  - User dialog button to open group moderation tools.
  - Group dialog, add last visited and previous instances (#1351).
  - Add moderation icons to playerList, for when you've previously moderated a user (block, mute, etc).
  - VRCX autorun option to only open single instance of app, defaulted to enabled.
  Changes
  - Change navigation bar icons.
  - When using Invite to group only show groups with invite permission.
  - Sort playerList by icons.
  - Click dialog titles to copy displayName to clipboard.
  Fixes
  - Fix running VRCX as Admin (although ideally you shouldn't).
  - Fix clear and copy favorites.
  - Fix avatar/world updated at date.
  - Fix searching through group members.
  - Fix removing local avatar favorites while holding the shift key.
  Linux/macOS (Electron)
  - Expect the updater to be broken while updating to this release, it's fixed in future releases.
  - Add support for arm64 on Linux and macOS, Linux arm64 builds are currently in nightly and will be in stable next release.
  - Include dotnet runtime with macOS builds.
  - Launch commands now work on Linux while VRCX is already running, e.g. vrcx:\\world\wrld_id (#1352).
  - Fix crash when OpenVR isn't installed, include openvr library in expected path.
  - Add option to disable registry restore popup.
