  What's New
  - Custom Search Limit: We separated the search limit from the load limit. You can now search many results while keeping the load count low to save memory.
  - Mutual Graph: A complete rewrite for better speed and readability. You can now adjust the graph layout parameters to fit your needs.

  - Tools Reorganized: "Auto Change Status" is now in the "Tools" tab. Please look there for all our miscellaneous tools.
