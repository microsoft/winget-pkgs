ShortDescription: VMware Workstation Pro is the industry standard for running multiple operating systems as virtual machines (VMs) on a single Linux or Windows PC to build, test, or demo software.
Description: |-
  VMware Workstation Pro™ enables technical professionals to develop, test, demonstrate, and deploy software by running multiple x86-based Windows, Linux, and other operating systems simultaneously on the same PC.
  You can replicate server, desktop, and tablet environments in a virtual machine and allocate multiple processor cores, gigabytes of main memory, and graphics memory to each virtual machine, whether the virtual machine resides on a personal PC or on a private enterprise cloud.
