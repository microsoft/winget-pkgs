  What's New in This Release
  
  Horizon Client for Windows 5.5.2 includes various bug fixes and the following security fix and new features:
  
  • Horizon Client for Windows contains multiple out-of-bounds read vulnerabilities in the Cortado ThinPrint component. These issues exist in the TTC and JPEG2000 parsers. A malicious actor with access to a remote desktop might be able to exploit these issues. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the identifiers CVE-2021-21987 (TTC parser), CVE-2021-21988 (JPEG2000 parser), and CVE-2021-21989 (TTC parser) to these issues. For more information, see VMSA-2021-0009.
  • Horizon Client for Windows supports the URL Content Redirection and HTML5 Multimedia Redirection features with the Microsoft Edge (Chromium) browser with VMware Horizon 7 version 7.13.1. For more information, see Release Notes for VMware Horizon 7 version 7.13.1.
