  Highlights
  - ABC and Lilypond embedding now use SVG (vector graphics) instead of pixmap images.
    This is very crisp at all sizes, and greatly reduces the size of the resultant PDF document.
  - The ChordPro GUI (wxchordpro) has been extended with a Tasks menu that can be used to quickly select presets for a specific task.
    For example, to produce a PDF with only lyrics, or with keyboard diagrams instead of string diagrams.
    User presets can be added by placing small config files in a tasks folder under the CHORDPRO_LIB.
  ChordPro functionality
  - Directives and config to change the chorus appearance.
  - Add support for SVG images.

    XXX as fonts in SVG.
  - Handle ABC and Lilypond embedding via SVG images.
    No more need for ImageMagick.
    Add 'staffsep' option for ABC embedding.
  - Add 'omit' to delegates config.
  - Infer chord inversions for keyboard.
  - Use SVGPDF text callback to substitute missing flat/sharp glyphs.
  - Trap missing font sizes (should not happen).
