  Highlights
  - ABC and Lilypond embedding now use SVG (vector graphics) instead of pixmap images.
    This is very crisp at all sizes, and greatly reduces the size of the resultant PDF document.
  - The ChordPro GUI (wxchordpro) has been extended with a Tasks menu that can be used to quickly select presets for a specific task.
    For example, to produce a PDF with only lyrics, or with keyboard diagrams instead of string diagrams.
    User presets can be added by placing small config files in a tasks folder under the CHORDPRO_LIB.
