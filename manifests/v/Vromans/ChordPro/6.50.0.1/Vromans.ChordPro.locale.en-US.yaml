  Highlights
  - Customize the tables of content by providing a template. The template is processed as a song before the tables and can be used to set title, subtitle, columns, maybe even an introduction text. Since the template it iself a song, it can be associated with its own config file for unlimited customization. Read more...
  - New delegated environment: textblock. The text between start_of_textblock and end_of_textblock is formatted normally, but the result is an image that can be placed anywhere. Several attributes are available to control the appearance of the text, e.g. centered and flush right. Read more...
