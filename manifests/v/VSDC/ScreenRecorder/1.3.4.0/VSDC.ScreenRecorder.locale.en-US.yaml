Description: |-
  VSDC Free Screen Recorder is an easy-to-use lightweight screen recorder software that lets you capture your PC screen and save it in the MP4 format.
  It lets you capture the entire desktop screen, a selected area or even a videogame window of any resolution. You can also connect inbuilt or external
  devices — including microphones, webcams, or video capture cards — and use all of them simultaneously. This app makes it possible to record in 4K UHD absolutely
  for free. VSDC Free Screen Recorder is a perfect tool for creating tutorial videos, game walkthroughs, reaction videos or business presentations.
