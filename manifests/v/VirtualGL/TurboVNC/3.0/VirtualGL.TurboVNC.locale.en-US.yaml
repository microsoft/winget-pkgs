ShortDescription: High-speed, 3D-friendly, TightVNC-compatible remote desktop software
Description: |-
  TurboVNC is a high-performance, enterprise-quality version of VNC based on TightVNC, TigerVNC, and X.org.
  It contains a variant of Tight encoding that is tuned for maximum performance and compression with 3D applications (VirtualGL), video, and other image-intensive workloads.
  TurboVNC, in combination with VirtualGL, provides a complete solution for remotely displaying 3D applications with interactive performance.
  TurboVNC's high-speed encoding methods have been adopted by TigerVNC and libvncserver, and TurboVNC is also compatible with any other TightVNC derivative.
