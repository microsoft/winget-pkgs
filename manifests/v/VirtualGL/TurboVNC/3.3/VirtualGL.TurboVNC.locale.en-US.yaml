ShortDescription: High-speed, 3D-friendly, TightVNC-compatible remote desktop software
Description: |-
  TurboVNC is a high-performance, enterprise-quality version of VNC based on TightVNC, TigerVNC, and X.org.
  It contains a variant of Tight encoding that is tuned for maximum performance and compression with 3D applications (VirtualGL), video, and other image-intensive workloads.
  TurboVNC, in combination with VirtualGL, provides a complete solution for remotely displaying 3D applications with interactive performance.
  TurboVNC's high-speed encoding methods have been adopted by TigerVNC and libvncserver, and TurboVNC is also compatible with any other TightVNC derivative.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Significant changes relative to 3.3 beta2:
  1. For compatibility with OpenSSH, the TurboVNC Viewer's built-in SSH client now disables multi-hop/multi-level SSH tunneling if a case-insensitive argument of none is specified for the ProxyJump OpenSSH config file keyword. This is useful in conjunction with wildcard Host entries.
  2. The TurboVNC Viewer's built-in SSH client now prints an SSH debugging message, rather than throwing a fatal error, if it cannot parse an entry in the SSH known hosts file. This mimics the behavior of OpenSSH.
  3. The TurboVNC Server now includes various security fixes (CVE-2025-26594, CVE-2025-26595, CVE-2025-26596, CVE-2025-26597, CVE-2025-26598, CVE-2025-26599, CVE-2025-26600, CVE-2025-26601, CVE-2025-49175, CVE-2025-49176, CVE-2025-49178, CVE-2025-49179, CVE-2025-49180, CVE-2025-62229, CVE-2025-62230, and CVE-2025-62231) from the xorg-server 21.1.x code base.
