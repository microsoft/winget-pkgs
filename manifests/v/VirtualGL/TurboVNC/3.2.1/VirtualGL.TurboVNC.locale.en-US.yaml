ShortDescription: High-speed, 3D-friendly, TightVNC-compatible remote desktop software
Description: |-
  TurboVNC is a high-performance, enterprise-quality version of VNC based on TightVNC, TigerVNC, and X.org.
  It contains a variant of Tight encoding that is tuned for maximum performance and compression with 3D applications (VirtualGL), video, and other image-intensive workloads.
  TurboVNC, in combination with VirtualGL, provides a complete solution for remotely displaying 3D applications with interactive performance.
  TurboVNC's high-speed encoding methods have been adopted by TigerVNC and libvncserver, and TurboVNC is also compatible with any other TightVNC derivative.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Significant changes relative to 3.2:
  1. Fixed an issue in the TurboVNC Viewer whereby the "Default Window Size/Position" feature did not work properly in full-screen mode if TVNC_SINGLESCREEN/turbovnc.singlescreen was enabled.
  2. When using server-side key mapping, the Windows TurboVNC Viewer now works around an issue whereby the operating system does not send a key release event to applications if one of the Shift keys is released while the other Shift key remains pressed. 2.2.4[1] worked around this issue when using client-side key mapping, but due to an oversight, the server-side key mapping feature introduced in 3.1 beta1[4] did not include the same workaround.
  3. The default X startup script (xstartup.turbovnc) now assigns the same priority to session desktop files located in /usr/share/wayland-sessions and /usr/share/xsessions. This prevents an issue on Fedora 40 and later whereby, if GNOME and Xfce or MATE were installed but the (now optional) gnome-session-xsession package was not installed, TurboVNC used Xfce or MATE as the default window manager rather than GNOME.
