ReleaseNotes: |-
  - First stable release!
  - Raise warning when loops can have too many iterations (#352).
  - Raise warning when comparing a string that is known to be lowercase (like the result of hash.md5) with a string that contains uppercase characters (150500b). Example:
     warning[unsatisfiable_expr]: unsatisfiable expression
     --> line:5:9
      |
    5 |         test_proto2.string_foo == "FOO"
      |         ----------------------    ----- this contains uppercase characters
      |         |
      |         this is a lowercase string
      |
      = note: a lowercase string can't be equal to a string containing uppercase characters
  - Better handling of raw bytes and timestamps when decoding module outputs from Python (#357, d65a92a).
