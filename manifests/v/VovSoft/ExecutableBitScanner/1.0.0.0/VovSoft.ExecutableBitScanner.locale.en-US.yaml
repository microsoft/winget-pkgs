ShortDescription: A powerful and user-friendly Windows utility designed to analyze and categorize executable files and dynamic-link libraries within your system.
Description: |-
  Executable Bit Scanner is a powerful and user-friendly Windows utility designed to analyze and categorize executable files and dynamic-link libraries within your system. This efficient tool scans selected folders, providing valuable insights into the executable landscape of your computer.

  All executable binary files start with special markers. This executable checker program automatically checks MZ, NE, PE, LE headers.

  Key Features
  1. Comprehensive File Detection:
     Identifies both EXE (executable) and DLL (dynamic-link library) files
     Thorough scanning of selected folders and subfolders
  2. Multi-Architecture Support:
     64-bit executables for modern systems
     32-bit executables for backward compatibility
     16-bit executables from legacy applications
     DOS executables for historical software
     VXD files (Virtual Device Driver)
     ROM images
  3. User-Friendly Interface:
     Intuitive folder selection process
  4. Detailed Reporting:
     Option to export results in various formats (e.g., HTML, TXT, CSV, XLS, XLSX)

  Note that as of 1.0.0.0, the tool does not distinguish between traditional and ARM architectures, and that it cannot detect the bits of non-.exe executables.
