Description: |-
  Vovsoft VCF Splitter is an easy-to-use utility that lets you split large vCard (.vcf) files into individual contact files, with no internet connection required — your data stays entirely on your computer.

  Whether your VCF file contains hundreds or thousands of contacts exported from Outlook, iCloud, Android, Gmail, or other sources, this tool can break it down into separate .vcf files while preserving all contact fields, such as name, phone number, email address, company, website, and more.

  It supports vCard versions 2.1, 3.0, and 4.0, and works with multi-contact VCF files or multiple files at once using batch processing. All formatting and structure are fully retained.

  Your contacts never leave your device. Vovsoft VCF Splitter is a standalone desktop application that runs offline — no data upload, no background syncing, no risk of data leaks.
