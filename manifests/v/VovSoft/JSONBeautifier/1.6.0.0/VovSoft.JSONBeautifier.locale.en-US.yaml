Description: |-
  Vovsoft JSON Beautifier is an easy to use JSON viewer and JSON formatter software for your desktop or laptop computer. Opening a JSON file with a text editor usually reveals a text that is practically impossible to read and comprehend. Vovsoft JSON Beautifier provides a way to make the text inside JSON files readable.

  There are many online websites that can pretty print JSON files. However they have upload limitations. The best part of the program is that the conversion is done completely offline. You are the only controller of your private data. No JSON file is sent to internet in any case.

  This software is a simple yet handy JSON code viewer application for Windows that allows you to work with JSON files much easier. You will be able to read the contents of your JSON files with ease.

  Additionally, the application comes with an option that allows you to minimize the JSON file. If you need to minimize any JSON file, all you need to do is hit the "Compact" button. The application will minimize the file size, sacrificing the readability of the text.
