Description: |-
  Vovsoft Copy Files Into Multiple Folders is a handy piece of software that, as its name implies, enables you to copy and paste files to multiple directories in one quick operation. It is a very simple-to-use batch file copy tool. This application is great for those who only wish to transfer a set of files to many locations simultaneously in an effortless manner. First-time users should not run into any issues, as the program's functions are self-explanatory.

  Files, folders or URLs can be added to the list using the menu or drag & drop actions, and you can specify whether or not existing or read-only items should be replaced. The program automatically downloads any entered URL before it starts. A processing log is displayed in a separate window after the operation has been launched. It lets you know which files have been copied or skipped. The application can also recognize paths using operating system's Environment Variables.

  Additionally, the installer adds shortcut to SendTo folder, so that users can right-click files & folders from the context menu and copy to multiple folders all at once.
