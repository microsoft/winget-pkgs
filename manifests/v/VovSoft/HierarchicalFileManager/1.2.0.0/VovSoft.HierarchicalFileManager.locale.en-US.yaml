Description: |-
  Vovsoft Hierarchical File Manager is a simple file management utility that aims to bring the convenience of column-view browsing, similar to Mac's Finder, to Windows users. This easy-to-use application organizes folders and files in a horizontal, multi-pane layout where each directory level appears in its own column, helping users better understand their folder structure.

  When browsing through folders, each new selection opens in a column to the right while keeping parent folders visible on the left. This straightforward approach can make it easier to understand where you are in your folder hierarchy and move files between different locations. While not as feature-rich as Windows Explorer, this alternative file browser might be helpful for users who prefer a more visual approach to file management.

  Its column view layout could be particularly useful when working with nested folders, whether you're organizing documents, managing project files, or just trying to keep your files tidy.
