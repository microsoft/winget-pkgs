ShortDescription: Prevent your drive from going into automatic standby mode
Description: |-
  Modern hard disks are set to automatically enter sleep mode (also known as idle time) whenever file operations are no longer happening. This is a method that is supposed to help with cooling the physical disk and prolonging its lifespan. However, if you wish to prevent this from happening, for example if you want the disk to quickly respond to file operations even after remaining idle for long periods of time, then you can tinker with the built-in settings of your machine to turn off HDD sleep mode. If you find this method to be tedious, though, then you can turn to software utilities capable of keeping the HDD or SSD awake by creating small-sized files just to be able to mimic user interaction. Such a program is Vovsoft Prevent Disk Sleep.

  Designed with the casual user in mind, this program is incredibly simple to use. It can be scheduled to create a plain text document (TXT) in any disk of your choice, whether it's local or external USB drive. After a speedy installation that requires minimal intervention, the tool opens a plain window which shows all options available. Once you identify the disks you wish to prevent from sleeping, it's necessary to pick the matching drive letters from a menu, set the disk write interval (in seconds, minimum is 10 seconds), edit the name of the TXT file that will be created, as well as click the 'Start' button.

  Vovsoft Prevent Disk Sleep creates the text document with the given name. It's placed inside the specified folder in the selected disk, so it shouldn't be difficult to track down. The application doesn't create multiple files each time it writes to the disk. Instead, it updates the one document by adding date and time stamps. This is also helpful for logging its activity and finding out the exact time of each disk write. Whenever you want to disable the software, simply stop the operation after returning to the main app window. Using this utility ensures that your HDD gets no sleep, keeping it active and responsive at all times.
