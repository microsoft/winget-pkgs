Description: |-
  Vovsoft RegEx Extractor is a simple but powerful data mining software utility designed to extract various data from text files or logs using regular expressions and rules (contains, lacks, starts with, ends with). One of its advantages is that it allows batch processing, enabling you to perform searches within multiple files at the same time.

  Before clicking the "Start" button, you should drag'n'drop files or select the folder to scan. File masks are also supported. You can enter any regular expression (URLs, postal codes, phone numbers, dates, and many others). The results can be easily exported to a file and saved for future use.

  When you select a matched text, it will show its source file. You have the option to export all matched texts in TXT format or texts along with their corresponding source files in CSV format.
