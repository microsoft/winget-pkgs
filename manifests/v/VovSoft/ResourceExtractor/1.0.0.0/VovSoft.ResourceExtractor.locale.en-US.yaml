Description: |-
  Vovsoft Resource Extractor is a simple utility designed to help users scan files, and extract embedded resources from files like Windows executable (.exe) and dynamic-link library (.dll) files.

  Whether you're a developer, a reverse engineer, or a power user, this tool simplifies the process of accessing graphics, icons, cursors, sounds, strings, and other data packaged within these files.
  - Targeted Scanning: Easily specify a directory to scan, including the option to "Include Subfolders" for comprehensive searching.
  - Flexible Filtering: Use wildcards like *.exe and *.dll to focus the search on specific file types. A "Case-Sensitive" option is also available for precision.
  - Detailed File Listing: The results table provides essential metadata for the identified files, including the Filename (full path), Bits (x86 or x64 architecture), Extension, Date Modified, and Size (bytes).
  - Visual Aid: The "Show Icons" option displays the embedded icon alongside the file path, offering a quick visual reference.
  - File Size Calculation: The "Calculate Filesize" feature ensures you have accurate size information for the listed resources.
  - Batch Extraction: Define a "Destination Folder" and use the "Extract All" button to quickly and efficiently save all found resources to a single location.
  - User-Friendly Interface: The clear, intuitive design (as shown in the screenshot) ensures a simple and smooth extraction workflow.
