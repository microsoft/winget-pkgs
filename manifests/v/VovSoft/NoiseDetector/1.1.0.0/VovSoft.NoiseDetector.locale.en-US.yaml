Description: |-
  Vovsoft Noise Detector uses the microphone on your computer to let you know when the noise level is too much.

  Teachers can use this software as a free classroom noise level meter and noise monitor tool. This tool is perfect if your school kids are too noisy!

  The noise threshold level can be adjusted using the slider, while the tolerance time (in seconds) can be changed as well. You can choose between 3 different warning sounds: a beep and a "shhh" spoken either by a male or a female. You can also select custom WAV file. When the noise level gets too high exceeding the threshold, the warning sound is played, and this might help calm the chaos in the classroom.

  The microphone can be automatically started when the application is launched and the window can be minimized to the system tray, so that it does not interfere with your work at all. The application comes in two editions: a standard installer one and a portable version. This tool might come in handy to teachers with a noisy classroom.
