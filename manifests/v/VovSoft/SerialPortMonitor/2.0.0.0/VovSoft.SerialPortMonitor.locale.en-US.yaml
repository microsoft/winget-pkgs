Description: |-
  Vovsoft Serial Port Monitor is an easy to use utility that allows monitoring your computer's COM port data traffic. You can read serial data from any COM port and send data to any COM port. You can change connection parameters such as baud rate (bits per second), parity, data bits and stop bits. This software can send and receive data in ASCII text. Hexadecimal, decimal, octal and binary formats are also supported when sending and displaying received data. It is possible to send serial commands periodically or according to a time schedule. "Clear", "Save to file" and "Copy to clipboard" buttons can be used. Setting font and background color is allowed by using the menu.

  Using this simple COM port sniffer and logger program, you can test, monitor and control any hardware compliant with RS-232 protocol, RS-485 protocol, RS-422 protocol or other compatible serial port device. The RS-232 (DB9) pinout specifies that only the RX (receiver) and TX (transmitter) pins are necessary for communication. The rest of the pins are necessary only if you implement some form of hardware flow control. You can easily read incoming data from RX and send outgoing data to TX with the help of a serial port analyzer and tester software, such as Vovsoft Serial Port Monitor. This application is an easy to use serial input listener and output transmitter software for students and electronic enthusiasts. Your desktop or laptop computer can communicate between microcontrollers (such as Arduino boards) or microprocessors (such as Raspberry Pi single-board computers) via serial communication with the help of this software.

  This program allows you to send serial commands periodically or according to a time schedule.
  - Send Periodically: Sends the same command repeatedly at a specified interval in milliseconds
  - Send Later: Sends commands at a later time by entering a future date and time
