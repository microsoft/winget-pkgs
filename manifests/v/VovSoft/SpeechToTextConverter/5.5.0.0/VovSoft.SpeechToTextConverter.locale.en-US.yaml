Description: |-
  Vovsoft Speech to Text Converter is an automatic speech conversion software to convert voice into text, supporting more than 50 languages. This audio to text utility can save you hours transcribing interviews, meetings, podcasts or any long audio files.

  In addition to audio files (MP3, M4A, FLAC, WAV, OGG), this application also supports video files such as MP4, WEBM, MKV, AVI, MPEG, MOV, WMV, FLV, TS. It will automatically extract speech from any video file and convert to text.

  If you have recorded some important lectures or speeches and want to convert them into text (transcription), you can either go the manual route of listening to the speech and typing the text or you can make use of the recent developments in the artificial intelligence (AI).

  Vovsoft Speech to Text Converter is such an AI powered software that can take your audio files, run them through your computer or cloud servers and produce very accurate transcripts. It uses language profiles for recognition, and if you are not getting good speech-to-text conversion then switching to a different profile can give you better results. This audio file to text converter program is ideal for both professionals and home use.

  The software supports offline and online speech engines:
  - Vosk is a speech recognition toolkit that works offline, supporting 20+ languages
  - Continuous Dictation uses Microsoft Speech Platform which is the built-in (offline) speech recognition engine of Windows
  - Deepgram ($200 free credit)
  - OpenAI (Whisper) ($0.006 / minute)
  - IBM Cloud (Speech to Text) can convert up to 500 minutes per month for free
  - Microsoft Azure (Cognitive Services) can convert up to 300 minutes per month for free
  Note: (IBM Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and OpenAI may require a valid credit card for registration and may not be available in some countries such as China and Taiwan.)

  You can now leverage the capabilities of multiple powerful speech-to-text engines from a single interface, making it easier than ever to achieve optimal results.
