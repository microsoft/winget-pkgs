  Check any website for dead links with the help of this lightweight software utility that enables you to export the results for further analysis.

  Vovsoft Broken Link Detector runs a comprehensive scan that checks for broken hyperlinks.
  It is common knowledge that dead hyperlinks negatively impact your website since not only is the user experience spoiled, but your overall ranking is damaged, with search engines not indexing your page.
  Once you have installed the program on your computer, which you is a hassle-free process, you are welcomed by a clean user interface anyone could figure out in a matter of seconds.
  At the top of the main window, you can enter the URL you want the tool to analyze, with the possibility of stopping the scan at any point by resorting to a dedicated button.

  To be more specific, the app can check the domain name only, strictly the subdomain name, or all domain names, with the possibility of recursive scan as well. On the other hand, if you are an advanced user, you may want to take a glimpse of the extra options so that you can manage connection timeout, response timeout, user-agent, ignored extensions, and ignored URLs.
