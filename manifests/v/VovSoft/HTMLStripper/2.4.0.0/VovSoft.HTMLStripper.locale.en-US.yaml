  Vovsoft HTML Stripper is a simple tool to strip HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language). Remove HTML and formatting from your text. This software gives quick and easy way to transform formatted text. This HTML2TXT tool is an HTML code stripper that helps you to strip HTML tags, remove code and convert to text/string/data.

  This HTML cleaner software converts ugly formatted or HTMLified text into a clean and pretty text for you to enjoy. The application can be helpful for people who want to save a massive amount of time cleaning up messy text packed with HTML tags, Javascript code snippets, CSS styles and ugly formatting. All you have to do is to click a button - and voila!

  A common use case for this is when someone wants to publish an article on a website they don't control. Some websites impose strict limitations on what content can be inserted into the HTML. Sometimes this may even include having to remove tags that are required for formatting or specifying the layout of a webpage.

  There are many online services that can strip .html or .htm files. However they have upload limitations. The best part of the program is that the conversion is done completely offline. You are the only controller of your private data. No HTML file is sent to internet in any case.
