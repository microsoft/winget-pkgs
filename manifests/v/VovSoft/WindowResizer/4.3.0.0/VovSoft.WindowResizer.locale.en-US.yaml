Description: |-
  Vovsoft Window Resizer is a utility software that allows you to resize any window to an exact, predefined size. This is extremely useful when designing web pages, as it allows you to see how the page will look when viewed at a smaller size. The utility is also handy when compiling screenshots for documentation. Using Window Resizer allows you to easily maintain the same window size across screen grabs. Additionally, it works well with multi-monitor setups, allowing you to open different applications in specific positions on each monitor at Windows startup.

  If you are looking for a program resizer software, this utility is able to resize programs by identifying the window title of any currently running application. This software is not limited to just resizing browsers, unlike browser extensions. It has the capability to resize all programs, including Word, Excel, PowerPoint and browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Edge.

  Moreover, if you come across an application that doesn't permit resizing or imposes restrictions on resizing, Window Resizer can effectively modify the dimensions of such applications. You can resize the main (owner) window of any program, as well as child windows and invisible windows. The program even allows you to lock dimensions and positions of any window, ensuring they remain fixed.

  This program can get and set exact window size values by taking non-client areas into account. It can utilize Desktop Window Manager (DWM)

  By right-clicking any window in the list, you can access the features below through the popup menu.
  - Change Window Title: Instantly modify the title text of the selected window.
  - Screen Center: Move the selected window to the exact center of the screen.
  - Blackened Background: Dim the background to highlight the selected window.
  - Check Responsiveness: Test if the selected window is responsive or frozen.
  - End Task: Forcefully close the selected window or application.
