Description: |-
  Vovsoft Keystroke Visualizer can show keys on your screen on top of everything. It can be very useful for presentations or creating software demonstration videos. Small texts will pop-up in the bottom-right corner or anywhere you move. It is a simple keypress OSD (on-screen display) software that can show what the demonstrator has typed or keys pressed.

  This program provides keycap visualizations that enables your viewers to follow along with ease. It's the perfect tool for screen sharers, meeting hosts, tutorial creators and presenters - anyone who teaches or demonstrates on desktop or laptop computer.

  This tool can help you up your game by constantly showing your audience which keys you are currently pressing, so you can show them shortcuts or hotkeys they could use as well. The application's main menu sits quietly in the system tray, while the actual window where you can view the pressed keys can be placed wherever you choose on your screen. It displays on top of all your open windows, meaning it is always visible without any additional effort on your side - when it detects that your keyboard is idle, it automatically hides from your screen, so it does not interfere with your presentation.
