ShortDescription: Vovsoft Time Sync is a software utility that capitalizes on precisely this idea since it offers to inform you about the time in your timezone as well as make sure your Windows clock is flawed by no desynchronization.
Description: |-
  Sync your PC clock with a time server by using this app and make sure you are always in the know as to the passing of every single second. We all know how precious every single moment of our time is, and we are all trying to make the most of it. Vovsoft Time Sync is a software utility that capitalizes on precisely this idea since it offers to inform you about the time in your timezone as well as make sure your Windows clock is flawed by no desynchronization.

  You can use this auto time updater software and set time in Windows when your computer's CMOS battery is dead or missing.

  Time Sync is a minimalist app designed to check whether your Windows clock shows the correct time. The program can sync it with any supported NTP server (port 123), and all that is asked of you is that you click one single button.
