Description: |-
  Vovsoft CPU Benchmark is a lightweight tool designed to evaluate your processor’s performance by running synthetic benchmarks and reporting operations per second (M ops/sec).

  Whether you're curious about your CPU's raw speed, testing the effects of overclocking, or stress‑testing stability, this program helps you:
  - Detect CPU name, architecture, base speed (MHz), and live speed (MHz).
  - Choose between single‑core or multi‑core test modes with just one click.
  - Select specific tests: integer arithmetic, floating‑point arithmetic, trigonometric, branch prediction & control, and bitwise logic.
  - Adjust test length to push CPU usage to 100% for extended stress testing.
  - View results in million operations per second, making comparisons easy.
