Description: |-
  Designed with simplicity in mind, Vovsoft CSV to JSON Converter can only perform one task, that of extracting the contents from the input CSV container, then transfer it to a newly created JSON file. In other words, you just have to select the input CSV file and choose to export it to JSON format, all with just a few clicks.

  The best part of the program is that the conversion is done completely offline. You can convert small files as well as large files bigger than 1 gigabyte. You are the only controller of your private data. No CSV or JSON file is sent to the internet in any case.
