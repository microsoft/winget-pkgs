Description: |-
  Vovsoft Compare Two Texts is a Windows software designed for comparing textual content.

  The software allows users to compare two files side by side, making it easy to identify and visualize the differences between them. It's particularly useful for tasks such as code comparison, document revisions, and content analysis.

  One of its key features is its ability to accurately detect and highlight differences between the compared texts. Additionally, the software can identify and display lines that are unique to each text file, helping users identify additions, deletions, or modifications between versions of a document or codebase.

  This program offers customizable options to tailor the comparison process to specific needs. Users can choose to ignore whitespaces, ignore letter cases (uppercase/lowercase), even change comparison algorithm, ensuring accurate and meaningful comparisons. It supports loading plain text files (txt) and Microsoft Word documents (doc and docx).
