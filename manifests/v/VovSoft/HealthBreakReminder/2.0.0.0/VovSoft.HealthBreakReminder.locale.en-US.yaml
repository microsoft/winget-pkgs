Description: |-
  Spending long hours in front of your computer can make it easy to lose track of time, often at the expense of your well-being. Skipping regular breaks can negatively impact both your physical and mental health. Vovsoft Health Break Reminder is here to help — your perfect Windows companion for maintaining a healthier work-life balance.

  This intuitive "take a break reminder" software is designed to seamlessly integrate into your daily routine, ensuring you prioritize your well-being during those long hours at the computer. No more straining your eyes, overworking your hands, or sacrificing your sanity.

  Key Features
  - Effortless Break Reminders: Our software gently nudges you to take breaks at user-defined intervals. Bid farewell to endless work sprints and hello to improved productivity.
  - Smart Idle Detection: Our software is smart enough to detect your mouse and keyboard activity. When you return to your computer after a period of inactivity, your work time resets automatically, so you don't have to worry about managing timers.
  - Offline Functionality: Our software is not a browser extension or a browser-based application; it operates independently offline, running seamlessly as a standalone application in the system tray without consuming system resources.
