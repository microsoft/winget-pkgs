Description: |-
  Vovsoft External Link Detector is a software product that helps users to scan any website and identify all the outbound links that are present on web pages.

  Regularly checking a website's links is essential for a number of reasons:
  - Identify any unauthorized or suspicious external links on a website, which could potentially be harmful or malicious.
  - Identify broken external links, which could have a negative impact on user experience and can also harm a website's search engine rankings.
  - Identify expired domain names. When a domain name expires, it becomes available for registration. It may be possible to register it and use it for a variety of purposes, such as redirecting traffic to a new website or using it for search engine optimization.
