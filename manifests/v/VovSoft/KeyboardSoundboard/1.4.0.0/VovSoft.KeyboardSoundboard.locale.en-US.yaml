Description: |-
  Vovsoft Keyboard Soundboard is a fun little app that allows you to assign sounds to keyboard keys.

  Have you ever wanted to play the piano and never had the chance? Well, now you can turn your own computer into a playable instrument with this application.

  What this software utility actually does is display a virtual keyboard that has most of the keys assigned to different sound files, allowing you to generate different sounds when hitting a button.

  Turn your computer keyboard into a sound trigger and musical instrument. Assign sound files onto keyboard keys, creating custom soundboard at your fingertips with no extra hardware needed. The software supports all keyboard layouts and includes an optional matrix display.

  You can use the pre-assigned sounds, mix and match or use your own .WAV files to personalize your keyboard.
