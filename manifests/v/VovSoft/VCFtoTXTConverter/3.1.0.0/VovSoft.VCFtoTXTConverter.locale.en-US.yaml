  VCF files store information regarding your contacts, enclosing more vCards (short for Virtual Business Cards), each on a separate row. Such files are used to export and import contacts from and to Microsoft Outlook. In case you want to build a list of contacts in your Outlook address book, you can try to export the content of the VCF file. Desktop computers, laptops and mobile phones can recognize VCF file type.
