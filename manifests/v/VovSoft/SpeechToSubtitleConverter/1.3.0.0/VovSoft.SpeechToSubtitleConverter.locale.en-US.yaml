Description: |-
  Vovsoft Speech to Subtitle Converter is an automatic speech conversion software to convert voice into subtitles, supporting more than 50 languages. It effortlessly synchronizes texts with the corresponding timestamps. This audio to subtitle utility can save you hours transcribing audio and video files.

  This program supports VTT and SRT subtitle formats. VTT is the format used in Youtube and Zoom transcriptions. SRT is the most popular video/movie subtitle filetype.

  In addition to audio files (MP3, FLAC, WAV, OGG), this application also supports video files such as MP4, WEBM, MKV, AVI, MPEG, MOV, WMV, FLV, TS. It will automatically extract speech from any video file and convert to subtitles.

  If you have recorded some important lectures or speeches and want to create closed captions (CC), you can either go the manual route of listening to the speech and typing the text or you can make use of the recent developments in the artificial intelligence (AI). Vovsoft Speech to Subtitle Converter is such an AI powered software that can take your audio files, run them through cloud servers and produce very accurate subtitles.

  Note: Although this program itself is freeware, it requires an API key from Replicate, which is a paid service.
  However, don't worry; Replicate's usage-based pricing is very affordable. For example, it costs as little as $0.10 for a 60-minute file.
