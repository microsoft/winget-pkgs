  Vovsoft Picture Puzzle is a simple game where you have to swap pieces around to get them in the right spot. If you have all pieces in the right spot, you complete the game! The game can divide any image file into blocks. The blocks are then scrambled up and need to be placed in the correct order to recreate the original image.

  Similar to jigsaw puzzle games, swap puzzles are a type of picture puzzle game. A picture is divided into blocks or squares. Players are challenged to rearrange the scrambled up blocks to form a picture. Swap puzzle games teach problem solving and spatial awareness. They also help to develop visual perception skills. Exercise your brain with this fun puzzle game. You can play this brainy game on your desktop or laptop computer.

  Click on two different pieces to swap them. If a piece is in the right place, you can't move it afterwards.
