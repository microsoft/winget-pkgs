Description: |-
  Vovsoft Image Splitter is an image and photo slicer software that you can divide multiple images in bulk. You can add images individually, drag and drop, or select a folder where they are located and let the application extract all the compatible pictures. All the images are displayed in a list, along with their width and height. You can easily change how many output images will be created. Once you do so, pressing the "Split All" button will start creating the images. The splitted images will be saved to your preferred directory. This batch picture splitter software also allows you to preview before actually creating images.

  - Split by Grid Layout: Divide your images into evenly sized sections based on a grid layout. Simply specify the number of rows and columns, and the image will be sliced into uniform pieces. Perfect for creating photo collages, posters, or detailed image sections. Example: Split an image into a 3x3 grid to get 9 equal-sized sections for a photo mosaic.
  When "Equal Output Dimensions" option is enabled, all the output image files will have identical width and height. However it may cause some pixels on the edge of the picture to be ignored due to numerical rounding.
  - Split by Dimensions: Cut your image into sections based on specific pixel dimensions with this image cutter software. Define the width and height in pixels for each segment, and the image will be split accordingly. Ideal for precise image cropping or creating consistent tile sizes. Example: Split an image into 300x400 pixel sections to create uniform tiles for a digital scrapbook.

  With "Exclude Margins", you can remove specified edge areas from your image before splitting. Define the top, bottom, left, and right margins to be excluded, ensuring that only the central portion of the image is divided. Useful for avoiding unwanted borders or focusing on the main content.
