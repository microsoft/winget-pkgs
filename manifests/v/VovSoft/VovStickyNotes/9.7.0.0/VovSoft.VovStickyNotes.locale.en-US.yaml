  For many people, the desktop is simply the place where shortcuts and icons are located, without any real functionality. Nonetheless, you can benefit from all the empty space on your desktop by adding post-its, and Vov Sticky Notes is one of the apps that can help you do that.

  Once you install it on your PC, the application automatically goes to the system tray, and you can double-click or right-click its icon when you want to create a new note. It basically opens a resizable window where you can paste text or start typing some of your important tasks. In addition to text, you can paste images and screenshots from clipboard. You can also drag and drop image files.
