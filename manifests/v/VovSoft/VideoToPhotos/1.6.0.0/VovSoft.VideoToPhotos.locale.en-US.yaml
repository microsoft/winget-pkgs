Description: |-
  Vovsoft Video to Photos is an easy to use software that can help you extract frames from video files. You just have to load videos and click the "Convert" button on its interface, and that is all. You can extract all frames or any image sequence (duration in milliseconds). All popular input video formats are supported such as AVI, MKV (Matroska Video), MOV (QuickTime Video), MP4, MPEG, WEBM and WMV.

  This video2photos application is a video to frames converter utility. You can load AVI, MP4, MPEG, WMV, MOV, MKV and WEBM files either one by one or in batch, when you want to speed up the operation. BMP files are the best quality, however they have very large filesize. To save disk space, you can choose JPEG and change JPEG quality ratio.

  This program serves as a video images extractor, making it easy to pull high-quality frames from any video. Whether you’re creating stills for editing, analysis, or archival purposes, this tool provides precise control over the output. You can extract every frame or set intervals to capture specific moments, helping you quickly transform video content into a series of detailed images.
