  Support for the new Scala 3 nightly repository
  This Scala CLI version supports the new Scala 3 nightly versions repository:
  https://repo.scala-lang.org/artifactory/maven-nightlies
  This means that newest Scala 3 nightly versions will become available to use with Scala CLI, as well as the 3.nightly tag will now refer to the actual, newest version.
  As a result, Scala 3.8 features like capture checked Scala 3 library should now be available from Scala CLI.
