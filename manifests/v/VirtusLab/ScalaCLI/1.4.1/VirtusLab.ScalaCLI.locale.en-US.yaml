ReleaseNotes: |-
  Pass compiler args as an @argument file
  You can shorten or simplify a Scala CLI command by using an @argument file to specify a text file that contains compiler arguments.
  -d
  outputDirectory

  The feature may help to work around the Windows command line character limit, among other things, making sure your scripts run on any operating system of your choice.
  scala-cli run -e 'println("Hey, I am using an @args file!")' @args.txt

  This works similarly to the command-line argument files feature of Java 9 and fixes backwards compatibility with the old scala runner (pre-Scala-3.5.0).Added by @kasiaMarek in #3012Explicitly enable or disable multithreading in Scala Native
  It is now possible to explicitly enable or disable multithreading in Scala Native builds.
  You can do it by setting the //> using nativeMultithreading directive:
  //> using platform native
  //> using nativeMultithreading
  import scala.concurrent._
  import scala.concurrent.duration._
  import ExecutionContext.Implicits.global
  val promise = Promise[Int]()
  val thread = new Thread(new Runnable {
      def run(): Unit = {
        Thread.sleep(100)
        promise.success(42)
      }
    })
  thread.start()
  val result = Await.result(promise.future, 2.seconds)
  println(result)

  Or the --native-multithreading command line option:
  scala-cli run native_multithreading.sc --native --native-multithreading
