ReleaseNotes: |-
  Support for Scala 3.7.0 and 3.3.6
  This Scala CLI version switches the default Scala version to 3.7.0.
  The CLI internals are now built with Scala 3.3.6.
  scala-cli version
  # Scala CLI version: 1.8.0
  # Scala version (default): 3.7.0
  Added by @Gedochao in #3661
  Support for Scala.js 1.19.0
  This Scala CLI version adds support for Scala.js 1.19.0.
  scala-cli -e 'println("Hello")' --js
  # Compiling project (Scala 3.7.0, Scala.js 1.19.0)
  # Compiled project (Scala 3.7.0, Scala.js 1.19.0)
  # Hello
  Added in #3643 and VirtusLab/scala-js-cli#134
  Drop support for Scala <3.3 in runner and test-runner modules
  Starting with Scala CLI v1.8.0, the runner and test-runner modules are built with Scala 3.3.6 LTS (on par with other modules built with Scala 3). They used to be built with Scala 3.0.2, as those modules may get added to the project class path when running, respectively, the main scope and tests. This means that if the application is using pre-3.3 Scala 3, TASTy versions will be incompatible.
  This is mostly informative, as the change should not be breaking for standard Scala CLI usage, even if an older Scala 3 version is being used. For builds using Scala <3.3, the CLI will automatically fall back to version 1.7.1 of the modules, with an appropriate warning being printed. As the fallback will not be updated in the future, some Scala CLI features might start breaking at some point, as the APIs will stop being fully in sync.
  scala-cli -e 'println("Hello")' --runner -S 3.1
  # [warn] Scala 3.1.3 is no longer supported by the runner module.
  # [warn] Defaulting to a legacy runner module version: 1.7.1.
  # [warn] To use the latest runner, upgrade Scala to at least Scala 3.3.
  # Compiling project (Scala 3.1.3, JVM (17))
  # Compiled project (Scala 3.1.3, JVM (17))
  # Hello
  scala-cli test . -S 3.2
  # [warn] Scala 3.2.2 is no longer supported by the test-runner module.
  # [warn] Defaulting to a legacy test-runner module version: 1.7.1.
  # [warn] To use the latest test-runner, upgrade Scala to at least 3.3.
  # Compiling project (test, Scala 3.2.2, JVM (17))
  # Compiled project (test, Scala 3.2.2, JVM (17))
  # Test run started
  # Test MyTests.foo started
  # Hello, world!
  # Test MyTests.foo finished, took 0.001 sec
  # Test run finished: 0 failed, 0 ignored, 1 total, 0.003s
  Realistically, the change is only breaking for apps using those modules directly themselves, either depending on them or using them to run things. In either case, it is recommended to update Scala up to at least 3.3 LTS.

  Scala CLI now detects and runs multiple test frameworks, rather than just one
  When running tests in a project with multiple test frameworks in use, Scala CLI will now attempt to detect and run all of them, rather than just one.
  scala-cli test .
  # Compiling project (Scala 3.7.0, JVM (23))
  # Compiled project (Scala 3.7.0, JVM (23))
  # Compiling project (test, Scala 3.7.0, JVM (23))
  # Compiled project (test, Scala 3.7.0, JVM (23))
  # Munit:
  #   + foo 0.007s
  # -------------------------------- Running Tests --------------------------------
  # + MyTests.foo 1ms
  # Tests: 1, Passed: 1, Failed: 0
  # + SimpleSpec
  # Hello from zio-test
  #   + print hello and assert true
  # 1 tests passed. 0 tests failed. 0 tests ignored.
  #
  # Executed in 97 ms
  #
  # Completed tests
  # ScalaTestSpec:
  # example
  # - should work
  # Run completed in 44 milliseconds.
  # Total number of tests run: 1
  # Suites: completed 1, aborted 0
  # Tests: succeeded 1, failed 0, canceled 0, ignored 0, pending 0
  # All tests passed.
  Additionally, it is now possible to pre-define multiple test frameworks to use (rather than just one, as before).
  //> using test.frameworks org.scalatest.tools.Framework munit.Framework custom.CustomFramework
  Pre-defining test frameworks may be preferable for bigger projects, as it allows to skip framework detection and run them directly. This is significant particularly for running tests with Scala Native and Scala.js.
