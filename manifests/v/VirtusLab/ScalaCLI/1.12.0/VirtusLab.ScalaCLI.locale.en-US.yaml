  scala-cli version
  # Scala CLI version: 1.12.0
  # Scala version (default): 3.8.0
  Added by @Gedochao in #4049

  # Hello
  Added by @Gedochao in #4040
  New aliases for RC and nightly Scala versions
  This Scala CLI version introduces dedicated aliases for calling the latest Scala Release Candidate versions in a given series (including LTS).
  scala-cli -e 'println(scala.util.Properties.versionNumberString)' -S rc
  # 3.8.1-RC1
  scala-cli -e 'println(scala.util.Properties.versionNumberString)' -S 3.rc
  # 3.8.1-RC1
  scala-cli -e 'println(scala.util.Properties.versionNumberString)' -S 3.8.rc
  # 3.8.1-RC1
  scala-cli -e 'println(dotty.tools.dotc.config.Properties.simpleVersionString)' -S 3.lts.rc --with-compiler
  # 3.3.7-RC2
  scala-cli -e 'println(dotty.tools.dotc.config.Properties.simpleVersionString)' -S lts.rc --with-compiler
  # 3.3.7-RC2
  Dedicated default and LTS nightly aliases are also provided.
  scala-cli -e 'println(scala.util.Properties.versionNumberString)' -S nightly
  # 3.8.2-RC1-bin-20260115-6151803-NIGHTLY
  scala-cli -e 'println(dotty.tools.dotc.config.Properties.simpleVersionString)' -S lts.nightly --with-compiler
  # 3.3.8-RC1-bin-20260112-d35b2d4-NIGHTLY-git-d35b2d4
  scala-cli -e 'println(dotty.tools.dotc.config.Properties.simpleVersionString)' -S 3.lts.nightly --with-compiler
  # 3.3.8-RC1-bin-20260112-d35b2d4-NIGHTLY-git-d35b2d4
  Also note that there is no easy way to identify an RC for Scala 2 / 2.12 / 2.13 (as a particular nightly serves as the RC for those Scala distributions).
  A reasonable error is also provided when it is requested.
  scala-cli -e 'println(scala.util.Properties.versionNumberString)' -S 2.rc
  # Invalid Scala version: 2.rc. In the case of Scala 2, a particular nightly version serves as a release candidate.
  scala-cli -e 'println(scala.util.Properties.versionNumberString)' -S 2.12.rc
  # Invalid Scala version: 2.12.rc. In the case of Scala 2, a particular nightly version serves as a release candidate.
  scala-cli -e 'println(scala.util.Properties.versionNumberString)' -S 2.13.rc
  # Invalid Scala version: 2.13.rc. In the case of Scala 2, a particular nightly version serves as a release candidate.
  Added by @Gedochao in #4042 and #4016
  (⚡️ experimental) Support for exporting to Mill 1.0.x and overriding the Mill version with --mill-version
  The export sub-command now allows to export to Mill 1.0.x projects.
  @main def main() = println("Let's export to Mill 1.0.6!")
  scala-cli export mill-1-0-6-export.scala --mill --mill-version 1.0.6 --power
  # Exporting to a mill project...
