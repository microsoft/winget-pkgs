ReleaseNotes: |-
  Change default Scala versions to 3.7.4 and 2.13.17
  This Scala CLI version switches the default Scala versions:
  - default Scala 3 to 3.7.4
  - default Scala 2.13 to 2.13.17
  scala-cli version
  # Scala CLI version: 1.10.0
  # Scala version (default): 3.7.4
  Added by @Gedochao in #3942 and #3895
  Support for the new Scala 3.8 REPL
  As per scala/scala3#24243, Scala 3 REPL has been extracted to a separate artifact in Scala 3.8, as a result of which the use of the REPL command with Scala 3.8.0-RC1-bin-20251101-389483e-NIGHTLY or newer will require upgrading Scala CLI at least to 1.10 to work.
  scala-cli repl
  # Welcome to Scala 3.8.0-RC1-bin-20251101-389483e-NIGHTLY (23.0.1, Java OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM).
  # Type in expressions for evaluation. Or try :help.

  # scala>
  Added by @Gedochao in #3936
  Support for adding extra directories to a Docker image
  This feature adds the ability to include additional directories in Docker images. Users can now specify extra directories to be copied into a Docker image during the build process. The directories can be passed with the --docker-extra-directories command line option or //> using packaging.dockerExtraDirectories directive.
  //> using packaging.dockerExtraDirectories path/to/directory1 path/to/directory2
  scala-cli --power package . --docker --docker-image-repository repo --docker-extra-directories path/to/directory
  Added by @btomala and @Gedochao in VirtusLab/scala-packager#250 and #3908
  Deprecate support for building GraalVM native images with Scala pre-3.3
  When building GraalVM native images with Scala CLI and Scala versions older than 3.3.0, the following warning will now be printed:
  # [warning] building native images with Scala 3 older than 3.3.0 is deprecated.
  # [warning] support will be dropped in a future Scala CLI version.
  # [warning] it is advised to upgrade to a more recent Scala version
  While the native images will still be built, the functionality will be removed in a future Scala CLI version. It is advised to migrate projects to Scala 3.3 or newer.
  Additionally, the following modules have been dropped and will no longer be published:
  - scala3-runtime
  - scala3-graal
  - scala3-graal-processor
  As they remain necessary for building native images for Scala pre-3.3 projects, their usage has been deprecated and frozen at respective version 1.9.1.
  Added by @Gedochao in #3929
  Stop publishing certain modules for Scala 2
  While it is technically an internal change, it is worth noting certain Scala CLI modules will no longer be published for Scala 2.
  Those include:
  - runner
  - test-runner
  - tasty-lib
  - config
  - specification-level
  From this point on, they will only be published for Scala 3.
