  Support for Scala 3.7.2
  This Scala CLI version switches the default Scala version to 3.7.2.
  scala-cli version
  # Scala CLI version: 1.8.5
  # Scala version (default): 3.7.2
  Added by @Gedochao in #3809
  Add props with input paths for non-script inputs
  2 new properties have been added, to provide a way to access input paths outside of .sc scripts:
  - scala.sources - full paths of all inputs in the project, separated by java.io.File.pathSeparator
  - scala.source.names - names of all inputs in the project, separated by java.io.File.pathSeparator
  //PrintSources.scala
  @main def main() = {
    println(sys.props("scala.sources"))
    println(sys.props("scala.source.names"))
  }
  ~/PrintSources.scala
  PrintSources.scala
  These are meant to be an input type agnostic equivalent for the scriptPath method available in .sc scripts.

  sonatype:snapshots points to the new Sonatype Central snapshots repository
  It is no longer necessary to manually add https://central.sonatype.com/repository/maven-snapshots, it is added under the sonatype:snapshots alias (along with the old snapshot repository).
  It is also added in all other contexts when snapshots should be used.
  //> using repository sonatype:snapshots
  Added by @Gedochao in #3797
  Scala CLI nightlies are available again
  We once again publish Scala CLI nightlies. You can use the newest version under the nightly tag.
  As pre-1.8.5 Scala CLI versions do not look for them on the new Sonatype Central snapshots repository, they will not be visible when called from earlier versions.
  scala-cli --cli-version nightly version
  # Scala CLI version: 1.8.4-24-g8ca6c960b-SNAPSHOT
  # Scala version (default): 3.7.2
  Note that the new Sonatype Central Portal retains snapshot versions for 90 days, so individual versions will be available to test for a limited time period.
  Added by @Gedochao in #3818
