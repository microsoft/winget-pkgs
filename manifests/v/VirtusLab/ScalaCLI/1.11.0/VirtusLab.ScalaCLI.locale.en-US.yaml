  Change default Scala versions to 2.13.18 and 2.12.21
  This Scala CLI version switches the default Scala versions:
  - default Scala 2.13 to 2.13.18
  - default Scala 2.12 to 2.12.21
  Added by @Gedochao in #3999 and #3958
  Fall back to a legacy version of the runner & test-runner modules for JVM < 17
  The newest versions of the runner and test-runner modules will require Java 17 or newer to run.
  When trying to use them with older JVMs, Scala CLI will now print a warning and fall back to using legacy versions of those modules instead.
