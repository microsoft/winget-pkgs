ShortDescription: A cross platform electron-based desktop app aiming to give you a snappier Discord experience with Vencord pre-installed.
ReleaseNotes: |-
  This is a pretty big update that brings a change to the look of the app
  What's Changed
  - Vesktop now has a new icon, including a Liquid Glass icon for MacOS
  - You can now customise the splash animation and tray icon (#1179)
  - Added the option to auto start the app minimised
  - Added autostart support to the Vesktop flatpak
  - The ping count badge should now show more reliably on Linux
  - Vesktop updates are no longer forced. From now on, they will open an Update notice popup with the changelog and options to update now, remind later, or ignore an update entirely (not recommended)
  - Fixed Vesktop registering itself as the default app for HTML files (this is actually an Ubuntu bug)
  - Added cli options to spoof Vesktop's user agent, useful for bypassing Discord's recent VPN Linux block
