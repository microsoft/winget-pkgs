  Simplified Paper Size Settings
  You no longer need to deal with two separate tabs – everything is now configured in one place.
  The Page Setup used to have two tabs:
  “Print Settings” – to select the paper size for printing
  “Page Size” – to set the dimensions of the drawing on screen
  To ensure correct output, the same paper size had to be set in both tabs, or the “Page Size” tab had to use the option according to print settings.
  It was common for users to change the paper size only in the “Page Size” tab, which caused the drawing to print in the size specified in “Print Setup”.
  The Page Setup now contains only one tab: “Print Settings”.
  You only need to set the paper size and orientation there. This is sufficient in nearly all situations.
  What happened to the “Page Size” tab?
  The tab still exists but is only accessible via a subtle button in the “Print Settings” tab. This helps prevent accidental misconfiguration by less experienced users.
  The “Page Size” tab is only useful in special cases – for example, if you want to print a drawing scaled to a different format (e.g. A3 reduced to A4). In such cases, use the “Fit to sheets” option in the “Print Setings” tab.
