ReleaseNotes: |-
  New Design
  The program has been completely redesigned, resulting in an improved appearance.
  Dark Mode
  The program supports dark mode, which can be activated using the menu command "View - Dark Mode". In dark mode, colors are displayed in inverse. Other colors used in the drawing are adjusted to maintain their contrast, meaning dark colors are converted to light and vice-versa.
  Multiple Monitor Support
  Open drawings are now displayed as tabs, making it easier to switch between them. Individual tabs can also be easily dragged and dropped to another monitor.
  Simplified User Interface
  For better clarity, rarely used symbols for gates and transformers have been removed from the toolbar. These elements are still available in the "Insert" menu.
  The "Window" menu has been removed as it is no longer needed in the new tab-based user interface.
  The "Textual Symbols" Panel Has Been Removed
  The "Textual Symbols" panel was historically the first tool for inserting symbols into the drawing. Later, three better options were added:
  The Symbol Search window always displays all relevant results from the entire database, regardless of their position in categories. This ensures that you never miss a needed symbol.
  The Symbols panel allows for visual searching and works better with synonyms. This makes finding the correct symbol significantly easier, even if you are unsure of the exact name or prefer visual orientation.
  The Favorites panel is continuously visible and allows for easy and quick insertion of symbols.
  The removal of the "Textual Symbols" panel paves the way for further gradual improvements and the expansion of the functionality of the remaining three options. The goal is to enable you to work with the program even more comfortably and quickly in the future.
  Title Block Preview
  When selecting a title block, a preview is now displayed, making it easier to choose the correct one.
  Keyboard Shortcuts
  The new keyboard shortcut Shift + A displays the Attributes window, where you can edit the attributes for the currently selected symbol.
  The new keyboard shortcut Shift + C displays the Connection points window, where you can assign numbers to the symbol connections for the currently selected symbol.
  Cross-References
  Cross-references between connections can include the connection name. Select the option {ref}/{pa}.{zone} in the program settings on the "Symbol" tab.
  Further Improvements
  In addition to the changes mentioned above, we have also worked on bug fixes and stability improvements for the program.
  How to Install
  Please back up your drawings and symbols before installation!
  Since the program has been completely redesigned and now has a different look and changed operation, we recommend carefully testing the new version before purchasing.
  You can install the program over the previous version. The upgrade is subject to a fee.
  If you purchased the program after April 18, 2024 , your license is also valid for this new version. In this case, activate the program with your existing license key.
