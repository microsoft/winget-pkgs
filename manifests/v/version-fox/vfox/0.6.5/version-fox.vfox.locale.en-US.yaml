ShortDescription: The Multiple SDK Version Manager
Description: |-
  If you switch between development projects which expect different environments, specifically different runtime versions or ambient libraries, or you are tired of all kinds of cumbersome environment configurations, vfox is the ideal choice for you.
  vfox is a cross-platform, extensible version manager. It supports native Windows, and of course Unix-like! With it, you can quickly install and switch different environment.
  It saves all tool version information in a file named .tool-versions, so you can share this information in your project to ensure that everyone on your team is using the same tool versions.
  Traditional work requires multiple cli version managers, each with its own API, configuration files, and implementation (e.g., $PATH operations, shims, environment variables, etc.). vfox provides a single interactive way and configuration file to simplify the development workflow and can be extended to all tools and runtime environments through a simple plugin interface.
