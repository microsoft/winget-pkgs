ShortDescription: This project aims to enhance the working environment on Windows
Moniker: explorerpatcher
ReleaseNotes: |-
  Warning
  ExplorerPatcher has a history of being falsely detected as malware by antiviruses (including Defender). This is likely due to its behavior, such as placing binaries in C:\Windows and performing in-memory patches on system components (notably explorer.exe and twinui.pcshell.dll) which is similar to how some game cheats operate.
  - Currently, Defender does not flag this release, but it is likely that future updates may being flagged by Defender's machine learning-based detection systems within a few days of release.
  - If Defender or another antivirus detects any part of EP as malware, it may prevent proper installation/uninstallation or cause explorer.exe to fail to start, leaving your computer with a non-working shell..
  - Issues related to antivirus detections will be closed immediately. Discuss this in #3670 or #3228.
  We strongly recommend excluding EP's binaries from antivirus scans. Expand the section below for which paths to exclude and more information:
  Please include the following files and folders in your antivirus' exclusion list to prevent issues due to antivirus detections:
  - C:\Program Files\ExplorerPatcher
  - %APPDATA%\ExplorerPatcher
  - C:\Windows\dxgi.dll
    ⚠️ IMPORTANT: explorer.exe will not start if this file exists but is blocked from being loaded.
  - C:\Windows\SystemApps\Microsoft.Windows.StartMenuExperienceHost_cw5n1h2txyewy
  - C:\Windows\SystemApps\ShellExperienceHost_cw5n1h2txyewy
  For Defender, you can run the following script in PowerShell as an administrator:
  Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath "C:\Program Files\ExplorerPatcher"
  Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath "$env:APPDATA\ExplorerPatcher"
  Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath "C:\Windows\dxgi.dll"
  Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath "C:\Windows\SystemApps\Microsoft.Windows.StartMenuExperienceHost_cw5n1h2txyewy"
  Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath "C:\Windows\SystemApps\ShellExperienceHost_cw5n1h2txyewy"
  - If your antivirus deletes the downloaded setup file, you may need to temporarily disable real-time protection or save the file in an excluded folder.
  - If you are uncomfortable with this process, or if your antivirus is managed by your company, we advise against using ExplorerPatcher. Please consider alternative solutions instead.
  Caution
  We DO NOT recommend using the Windows 10 (ExplorerPatcher) taskbar on work and mission-critical machines. Microsoft's monthly cumulative and "security" updates (which also bring new features and under the hood changes) can cause Explorer to be unstable or fail to start at all if EP has not been updated accordingly. More info here.
  We typically release a new version with the fix within a day after such a breaking change, but we cannot control whether users install the update promptly.
  Tested on OS builds 22621.3296, 22631.5189, 22631.5335, 26100.3476, 26100.4061, and 26100.4188.
