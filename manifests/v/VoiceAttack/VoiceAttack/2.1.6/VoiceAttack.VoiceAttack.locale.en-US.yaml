      - {INTDEFAULTFORMATUSER} is just like the previous token, but also allows for a
        default value.
      - {DECFORMATUSER} and {DECDEFAULTFORMATUSER} are the same as the integer tokens,
        but accept decimal values.
      - {DECINVFORMATUSER} and {DECINVDEFAULTFORMATUSER} are the same as the decimal
        tokens, but use the invariant culture.
