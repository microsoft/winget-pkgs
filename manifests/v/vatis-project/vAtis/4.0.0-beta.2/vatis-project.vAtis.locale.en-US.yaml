ReleaseNotes: |-
  Added
  - Added Profile Editor to manage all composites in one location
  - Added "Mini Display" window. This allows you to minimize the vATIS window to a smaller window that shows just the airport ICAO and current ATIS letter
  - Added Version property to the JSON payload that is posted to the IDS (#20)
  - Added support for an external ATIS generator source (e.g. UniATIS)
  - Added ATIS script dialog to voice recorded ATIS window
  - Added support for separate Departure and Arrival ATIS. Note: Each count as a separate connection; vATIS is limited to 4 simultaneous ATIS connections during the testing period.
  - Added configuration option to format ATIS using FAA ATIS format. If left unchecked, vATIS will format the ATIS using international/ICAO format.
  - Added formatting option for prepending "Notices to Airmen/Air Missions" to the spoken NOTAMs.
  - Additional formatting options (only available for non-FAA formatted ATISs):
      - Prepending "flight level" to the spoken transition level altitude
      - Prepending "surface wind" to the spoken wind
      - Appending "meters/kilometers" to the spoken prevailing visibility
      - Converting cloud layer height to metric
  Changed
  - Attach context menu to composite tree view (#1)
  - Disable DPI scaling. This should fix the weird scaling issues with high-DPI monitors
  - A maximum of 15 composites can be added to a single profile. Maximum simultaneous connections still limited to four (4). (#16)
  - Add option to include static Airport Conditions and NOTAMs before the free-form text
  - Numbers are now read in singular (serial) format by default (e.g. 6034 will be read as six zero three four). To read the numbers in group format, prefix the number with a pound sign (e.g. #6034) or enclose it in braces (e.g. {6034}).
  - Disable voice options when the composite (ATIS) is connected. You must disconnect the ATIS before changing between the voice options.
  Fixed
  - Fixed issue with the ATIS frequency in legacy profiles not importing correctly (#11)
  - Fixed issue with dialog windows not respecting the "keep on top" configuration option (#24)
  - Fixed missing period in VHF frequencies in the ACARS text (#22)
  - Append "zero" to non-FAA runway designators (#31)
  - Generate a new ATIS if the Airport Conditions or NOTAMs are changed
