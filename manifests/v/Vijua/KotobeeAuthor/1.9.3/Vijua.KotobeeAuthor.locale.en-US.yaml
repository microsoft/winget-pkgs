  New Question Types
  The question creation interface in Kotobee Author has been redesigned for better usability and clarity. You'll now find a more organized layout, along with three new question types: Image Hotspot, Numeric Answer, and Matching.
  Image Hotspot
  This new question type lets users respond by clicking on a specific point within an image. Using Kotobee's built-in question tool, you can upload your own image and define one or more correct areas. If users click within one of these predefined areas, the answer is registered as correct. This is especially useful for visual learning activities, such as asking students to click on the correct country in a world map or identify an organ in a human anatomy diagram.
  Numeric Answer
  Designed specifically for numerical input, this question type is a variation of the existing Short Answer format. Instead of entering text, users must input a number. You can define one or more acceptable numeric answers, which is helpful in cases where multiple values may be considered correct. For example, you can ask for a number that is divisible by both 2 and 3, where 6, 12, and 18 would all be accepted as valid answers.
  Matching
  With this format, you create two lists of items and ask users to match each item in the first list with its corresponding pair in the second. It works well for exercises that test associations between terms, such as matching countries with their capitals or scientific concepts with their definitions.
  Add Audio to Questions and Answers
  You can now insert audio clips directly into the question title and individual answer choices. This applies to various question types, including multiple choice and drag-and-drop formats. It's especially useful for language learning, accessibility, or including recorded instructions. For example, you can add pronunciation clips to each answer in a vocabulary test.
  Insert Images into Answer Options
  You can now add images directly to the answers of multiple-choice and drag-and-drop questions. This is especially useful for visual assessments, such as asking students to select the correct animal, identify an object, or match an image to a word, making it ideal for children's books and visually focused subjects.
  Feedback for Individual MCQ Answers
  Instead of a single explanation for the whole question, you can now provide specific feedback and reference links for each multiple-choice answer option. This allows you to give learners more targeted guidance based on the option they chose, which can help reinforce their understanding.
  Shuffle MCQs Answers Automatically
  You can now enable an option to randomize the order of multiple-choice answers each time a question is loaded. This prevents users from memorizing answer positions and helps keep quizzes more dynamic and fair, especially during repeated attempts.

  Preview Questions as You Create Them
  A new Preview tab in the question editor lets you see exactly how your questions will appear to your users, without leaving the editing window. This makes it easier to fine-tune formatting, layout, and content before saving.

  HTML Source Mode for Question Titles
  You can now switch to a source mode when editing question titles to enter custom HTML directly. This gives you more control over formatting and enables advanced use cases, such as inserting inline styles, spans, or embedded elements.
  Duplicate Questions
  You can now duplicate any question with one click, making it faster to build question sets with a similar structure or content.
  Highlight Errors in Quiz Questions
  If there's a problem with one of your questions, like a missing title or an unanswered field, Kotobee Author will now highlight exactly which question needs fixing. This helps you spot and correct issues faster, especially when working with longer assessments.
  Maximize Questions Window
  A new maximize button has been added to the question editor, allowing you to expand the window and make full use of your screen. This gives you more space and a cleaner view when creating or editing complex questions.

  Automatically Censor Inappropriate Words in Reviews
  You can now enable automatic filtering for inappropriate language in user-submitted book reviews across your library or cloud ebooks. Once activated in the settings, any flagged words will be replaced with asterisks. This helps you maintain a respectful and reader-friendly environment, especially in public or academic-facing libraries.
  Add Dropdown Fields to Registration Forms
  When selecting the fields of your registration form (through the library or cloud ebook Registration Settings), you can now choose to display fields as dropdown menus instead of plain text inputs. This makes it easier for users to fill out the form quickly and accurately. For example, you can let users select from predefined options like grade levels, departments, or job roles.
  Set SEO and Social Media Tags for Your Library
  Library admins can now customize the SEO metadata and social media preview tags for their library web apps, through the new "Website and SEO" section of the library settings. This helps improve how your library appears in search engine results and when shared on platforms like Facebook or X, making it easier to attract new visitors.
  Buy Button Now Shown for Unpurchased Books
  When users who haven't purchased a paid ebook visit its page in your library, they will no longer see an “Access Denied” message. Instead, they'll see the book's price along with a “Buy” button. Clicking it will prompt them to log in or create an account, increasing your chances of converting visitors into buyers.
  Kotobee Narrator: Library Access After Logging in
  Kotobee Narrator now supports login using either your serial number or your email and password. Once logged in, you can view all your libraries and browse the audiobooks available in each, making it easier to manage and edit your content from one place.
  Download and Export Audiobooks in Kotobee Narrator
  After logging in, you can now download any audiobook from your Kotobee Library(ies) directly into Kotobee Narrator for editing. Once you're done, you can export the updated audiobook back to the same library or to a different one. This makes it easier to update and manage your audio content across multiple libraries.
