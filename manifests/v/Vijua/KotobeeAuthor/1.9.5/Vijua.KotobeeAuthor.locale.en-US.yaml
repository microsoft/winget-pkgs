ReleaseNotes: |-
  Smart Chat: AI Assistance inside the Ebook
  Smart Chat allows readers to interact with an AI chatbot directly inside library and cloud ebooks. It can provide explanations, summaries, and review questions based on the currently opened chapter, helping them better understand the content without leaving the ebook.
  New Question Type: Drag into the Blanks
  This question type lets you add blank spaces within a sentence, similar to Fill in the Blanks, but using a drag-and-drop interaction. Readers are presented with a sentence with missing words and a list of keywords that includes both correct and incorrect options. To answer, they drag each correct keyword into the appropriate blank.
  Disabling Pasting in Question Text Fields
  For question types that require typed responses, such as Short Answer and Fill in the Blanks, you can now disable pasting into the text field. This helps reduce pasted answers from external sources and encourages learners to type their responses themselves.
  Enhanced PDF Export
  PDF export has been upgraded with a new generation engine. This improvement resolves issues that occurred in certain uncommon scenarios in older releases and improves overall export stability.
  New Permission Rule: Deny Book Access
  When adding users to your library, you can normally grant them access to specific books, categories, or even the entire library. In this release, a new rule has been added that allows you to deny access to selected books. This provides more flexibility as you will be able to give users access to a growing category or the entire library, while excluding specific books when needed.

  Hide Book Panel Categories
  You can now hide a book’s categories from its book panel. This provides additional customization flexibility and allows you to control how book information is presented to readers.

  Text-to-Speech for Desktop Apps
  Text-to-Speech is now available in exported desktop apps when using the Speech by Google option. Readers can listen to ebook content directly within Windows and macOS apps. This makes the ebooks more accessible and supports audio-based learning.
