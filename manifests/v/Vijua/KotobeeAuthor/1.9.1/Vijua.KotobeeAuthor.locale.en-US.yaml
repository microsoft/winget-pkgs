ReleaseNotes: |-
  Convert Text to Speech Using AI Voices
  You can now generate AI speech from any selected text using multiple voice profiles. This feature helps add narration or accessibility audio in just a few clicks.

  Add a Translate Button to the Ebook Toolbar
  You can now add a “Translate” button to the ebook's bottom toolbar. This allows readers to translate book content into the language of their choice. This feature is available for libraries and hosted ebooks only.

  New “Answers” Tab for Question Settings
  A new “Answers” tab has been added to the self-assessment question settings in Kotobee Author. This tab consolidates all options related to how answers are displayed, such as highlighting correct answers, showing explanations, using popups, inline layout, and toggle buttons. This makes it much easier to configure and manage answer behavior from one centralized place.
  Display Answer Choices Horizontally
  Within the new “Answers” tab, you can now choose to display answer choices horizontally (inline) rather than vertically. This gives you more control over layout and works well for short options like True/False.

  Use Toggle Buttons for Answer Selection
  For True/False and Multiple Choice (Single or Multiple Answer) questions, you now have the option to display answer choices as toggle-style buttons instead of standard checkboxes or radio buttons. This provides a friendlier and more modern interface, especially useful for mobile users or interactive learning formats.

  Add Read-Aloud Option for Questions
  A new play button can be displayed beside any question, enabling it to be read aloud using text-to-speech. This feature improves accessibility and can be particularly helpful for young learners or ESL readers.
  Audiobook Playback Now Includes Visualizer Animation
  When audiobooks are played in the reader, a fun sound visualizer is displayed on screen to provide a more dynamic listening experience.

  Show Audiobook Chapter Lengths in Table of Contents
  Chapters in audiobooks now display their duration (in minutes and seconds) directly beside each chapter title in the Table of Contents.
  View Total Audiobook Length in Kotobee Narrator
  While building an audiobook in Kotobee Narrator, the accumulated total length is now displayed in the book panel on the left. This will help you track the audiobook’s overall duration.
  Browse Books Within a Library Category
  In the library’s categories section, a new “View books” button has been added beneath each category, letting readers browse all books under that category instantly.

  Vertical Zoom Option (Fixed Layout)
  For fixed-layout ebooks in Kotobee Author, a new zoom option has been added: Fit Vertically. This complements the existing 'Fit Horizontally' and 'Original Size' zoom options, giving you more control over your workspace.
  Customize Book Panel/Popup Options
  New customization options allow you to selectively show or hide specific metadata (such as book description, publisher, book language, etc.) in the book's information panel or popup.
  The book information panel now also gives you the option to display the date a book was last modified, in addition to its original publication date.
  Quick Access to Mini-apps from the Toolbox
  For convenience, a Mini-app shortcut button has been added inside the toolbox, which takes you directly to the Mini-apps tab in the customization screen.
  YouTube Mini-app Now Free for All Users
  The YouTube mini-app is now free to download and use.

  Open Specific Books in LTI Using a Custom Parameter
  When integrating your library with an LMS via LTI, you can now have your library directly open to a specific book by using LTI Custom Parameters. To do this, simply include the book's unique ID as a parameter, such as "book=115485". This parameter can be adjusted for each instance.
  Resend Activation Emails to Inactive Users
  If some of the users you’ve added to your library or cloud ebook haven’t activated their accounts, you can now easily resend activation emails in bulk to all inactive users. This can be done from the Actions dropdown menu.
  Custom Billing Details
  You can now add a custom billing name and address to appear on your invoice emails, offering more control and personalization for your financial documentation. This can be made from the Account Settings under your user menu, inside Kotobee Author. This is especially useful for organizations requiring specific billing information for accounting purposes.
