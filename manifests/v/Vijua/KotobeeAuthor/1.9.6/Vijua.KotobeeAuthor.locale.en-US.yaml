  New Similar Books Section
  Your library can now display a You may also like section inside the book information panel. This feature can be enabled or disabled through the Book Popup customization settings. When enabled, this section shows up to 10 recommended books from your library that are related to the currently viewed title. These recommendations are generated using AI to identify meaningful connections between your books.
  JWT Single Sign-On
  Kotobee now supports authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). This allows users to access your library or cloud ebook through a single secure link. JWT SSO is especially valuable for organizations that want Kotobee to function as part of a larger system while eliminating duplicate logins for users. For example, universities integrating ebooks within their LMS or corporate training departments using internal employee portals to deliver courses. When a user opens the link, they are automatically signed in without being prompted to enter their credentials. The JWT securely includes the user’s email address for authentication.
  Timezone Management
  You can now set your timezone directly from the Account Settings tab in Kotobee Author. All displayed dates across your system will automatically reflect your selected timezone, including user signup dates, question submission timestamps, and other activity logs. This ensures greater accuracy when reviewing learner data, especially for organizations operating across multiple regions. Schools, universities, and corporate training teams can now align reporting and analytics with their local time without manual adjustments.
  Greek Language Support
  Greek has been added as a supported interface language in both Kotobee Author and Kotobee Reader. Greek-speaking authors and educators can now create content in their native language, while learners can access their ebooks through a fully localized interface. This enhances usability and expands Kotobee’s accessibility in Greek-speaking markets.
  Hosted Ebooks Storage Usage Display
  Your Hosted Ebooks page now shows the total storage used by all your hosted ebooks. This makes it easier to monitor your usage and plan ahead. It is especially useful for organizations working with large libraries, media-rich content, or audiobooks, where file sizes can grow quickly. By monitoring storage usage directly from the dashboard, administrators can better anticipate capacity needs and avoid unexpected limitations.
