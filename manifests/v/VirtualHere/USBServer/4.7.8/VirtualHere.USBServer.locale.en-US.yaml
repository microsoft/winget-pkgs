ShortDescription: >
  VirtualHere allows USB devices to be used remotely over a network just as if
  they were locally connected!
Description: |-
  Traditionally USB devices needed to be plugged directly into your computer to be
  used. With VirtualHere this is no longer required, the network itself becomes
  the cable transmitting USB signals (also known as USB over IP, USB/IP, USB over
  WiFi, USB over Ethernet, USB Device Server).

  This USB server solution is perfect for allowing USB devices to be used remotely
  over a LAN network, over the Internet, or in the Cloud without the USB device
  needing to be physically attached to remote client machine. The USB device
  appears as if it was directly attached even though it is plugged in to a remote
  server, therefore all existing drivers and software work, no special changes
  required.
ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Windows - added support for devices that upload/boot firmware when plugged in.
    E.g wired xbox controllers, Gudsen Moza Wheel
