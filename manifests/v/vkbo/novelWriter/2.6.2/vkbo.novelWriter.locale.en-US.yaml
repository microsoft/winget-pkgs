Description: |-
  A markdown-like text editor designed for writing novels and larger projects of many smaller plain text documents.

  Release Notes
  This is a patch release that fixes a few issues with the project tree: The Empty Trash option in the menu now works again, and it is no longer possible to accidentally drag and drop project items onto the root of the project tree.
  In addition, a Czech translation has been added by Tomáš Zmek, and the Italian, Polish and Brazilian Portuguese translations have been updated.
  Detailed Changelog
  Bugfixes
  - Fixed a bug where alternative scene formats were ignored when splitting a document. Issue #2233. PR #2234.
  - Fixed the Empty Trash menu entry in the Project menu. It was not connected to the project tree and therefore selecting it did nothing. Issue #2239. PR #2242.
  - Fixed a bug where it was possible to drag items to the root levels as long as they were dropped between existing root items. This action is now properly blocked. PR #2242.
  Improvements
  - Added an extra check in the project tree item model that can prevent a crash in certain circumstances when moving multiple project items. It is probably a corner case caused by competing garbage collectors in Python and Qt, but the additional check should handle. PR #2242.
  Internationalisation
  - Add Czech translation by Tomáš Zmek. PR #2244.
  - Updated Italian, Polish and Brazilian Portuguese translations. PR #2244.
  See the translation activity stream for more details.
