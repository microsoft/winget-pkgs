ShortDescription: A markdown-like editor for novels
Description: |-
  A markdown-like text editor designed for writing novels and larger projects of many smaller plain text documents.

  Release Notes
  This is a patch release that fixes an issue with creating new notes from the editor context menu, adds an option to turn off the confirmation box that pops up when closing novelWriter, and improves the recent project list on the Welcome dialog.
  A French version of the user guide is now also available when the localisation is set to French, and the French, Latin American Spanish, Norwegian, US English, German and Japanese translations of the application have been updated.
  Detailed Changelog
  Bugfixes
  - Fixed an issue where the "Create Note from Tag" would also show up for @story references. These should not create new novel documents. The same menu entry was also removed for @mention references, as it is not known what category the would belong to. Issue #2212. PR #2215.
  Improvements
  - A setting was added to Preferences to disable the dialog box when exiting novelWriter. It is available under the "Behaviour" section. Issue #2209. PR#2213.
  - Recent projects on the Welcome dialog box are now tracked using their unique ID as well as their path. This means that if a project is moved, it should not show up twice in the list, but the path should be updated. Issue #2217. PR #2218.
  Documentation
  - A French version of the user guide is nov available from the Help menu if the GUi language is set to French. The French translation was contributed by @Karduin. It is currently directly added to the source, but from 2.7 it will be generated automatically in the same way the English user guide is. Discussion #1834. PR #2220.
  Internationalisation
  - French translations are available up to the 2.6 release. That is, the new exit dialog setting is not translated yet. PR #2214.
  - Latin American Spanish, Norwegian, US English, German and Japanese translations are fully updated. PR #2214.
  See the translation activity stream for more details.
