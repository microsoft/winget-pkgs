ShortDescription: A markdown-like editor for novels
Description: |-
  A markdown-like text editor designed for writing novels and larger projects of many smaller plain text documents.
  It is designed to be a simple text editor that allows for easy organisation of text files and notes, with a meta data syntax for comments, synopsis, and cross-referencing between files, and built on plain text files for robustness.

  See the website for complete Release Notes.
  Detailed Changelog
  Bugfixes
  - Fixed a bug in the novel selector dropdown used a few places that would clear the selection if the novel list was refreshed. PR #2179.
  - Fixed a bug that would crash the app if the project tree was clicked without any project having been loaded. The selection model does not exist prior to a project load. Issue #2173. PR #2181.
  - Replaced a broken link on the dictionary install tool available on Windows. PR #2189.
  - Backported a few code fixes from 2.7 related to freeing memory from closed dialogs and one instance of a potentially uninitialised variable. PR #2202.
  - Fixed word wrapping in the item details panel for status and importance labels with very long names. PR #2202.
  - Fixed the project tree context menu so that it is not opened when right-clicking on an empty area of the tree widget. PR #2202.
  Improvements
  - Chapter headings are now level 1 headings in all manuscript output formats, not just HTML like before. Most applications that post-processes output will assume chapters are level 1. Correspondingly, scenes are now level 2 and sections are level 3. Notes headings remain unchanged. Issue #2205. PR #2206.
  Internationalisation
  - German, US English, Italian, Japanese, Norwegian and Polish have been updated in full. Brazilian Portuguese and Chinese have been partially updated. PR #2207.
  Documentation
  - Documentation has been updated with 2.6 features. PR #2210.
