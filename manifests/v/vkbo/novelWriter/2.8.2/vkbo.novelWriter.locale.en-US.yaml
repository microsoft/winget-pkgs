ShortDescription: A markdown-like editor for novels
Description: |-
  A markdown-like text editor designed for writing novels and larger projects of many smaller plain text documents.
  It is designed to be a simple text editor that allows for easy organisation of text files and notes, with a meta data syntax for comments, synopsis, and cross-referencing between files, and built on plain text files for robustness.

  Release Notes
  This is a patch release that fixes an issue with launching novelWriter via a project file on Windows, adds an alert when the spell check dictionary cannot be loaded, handles headings in HTML manuscripts the same way as for documents, and updates the documentation on how heading levels are handled in the manuscript build process.
  Detailed Changelog
  Bugfixes
  - Fixed an issue with the exe launcher on Windows where it didn't support spaces in the path when the user tried to open novelWriter from a project file. Issue #2643. PR #2645.
  - Fixed an issue with the PDF manuscript format which stopped after about 600-700 pages when generating A4 pages. The limit is now in the 11000 pages range. Issue #2637. PRs #2638 and #2639.
  Improvements
  - Added an alert box when the spell check language selected for a project could not be loaded. Issue #2631. PR #2654.
  - The HTML manuscript format now exports novel title and partition titles as paragraphs with a larger font size instead of HTML headings. This is more consistent with the other formatted document formats. Issue #2641. PR #2653.
  Documentation
  - Added information to the documentation about heading level promotion when building the manuscript. Issue #2641. PR #2653.
