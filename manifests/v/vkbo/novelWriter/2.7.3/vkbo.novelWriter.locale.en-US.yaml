ShortDescription: A markdown-like editor for novels
Description: |-
  A markdown-like text editor designed for writing novels and larger projects of many smaller plain text documents.
  It is designed to be a simple text editor that allows for easy organisation of text files and notes, with a meta data syntax for comments, synopsis, and cross-referencing between files, and built on plain text files for robustness.

  Release Notes
  This is a patch release that fixes a bug in, and makes a few improvement to, Preferences.
  Detailed Changelog
  Bugfixes
  - Fixes an issue where novelWriter would crash if a % was added to any of the free text settings fields in Preferences. Issue #2455. PR #2456.
  Improvements
  - The "Dialogue line symbols" setting in Preferences now has an "Add" button with a dropdown menu for all the symbols allowed in this field. Since virtually none of them are available on a regular keyboard, this makes it easier to add them and more transparent which symbols are allowed in the box. Issue #2453. PR #2457.
  - The switch for the "Allow open-ended dialogue" setting in Preferences has been moved up one line so it is clearer that it only applies to quoted dialogue, and not to the alternative dialogue settings. Issue #2454. PR #2457.
  Packaging
  - Package license information has been updated to also list the licenses for the new icon themes. Issue #2434. PRs #2435 and #2458.
