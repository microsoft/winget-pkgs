Description: |-
  A markdown-like text editor designed for writing novels and larger projects of many smaller plain text documents.

  Release Notes
  The 2.7 release updates the 2.7 RC 1 release and makes an improvement to the build settings tool. It also updates most translations and updates the French version of the documentation.
  See the website for complete Release Notes.
  Detailed Changelog
  Improvement
  - The Manuscript Build Settings dialog now works on a copy of the settings so that if the dialog box is closed without saving, all changes are discarded. It should also now detect any change made to properly raise a confirmation prompt when closing without saving. Issue #2350. PR #2351.
  Documentation
  - The user documentation has been restructured, and the Getting Started section has been made less technical. The install instructions have been moved out and into the main website. The technical and in-depth parts of the documentation have been kept, but moved further back so that the documentation can be read from the start and to the point where the user has enough information. The larger sections have also been split up so that it should be easier to find the wanted information directly from the menu. Issue #2345. PR #2355.
  Internationalisation
  - Updated US English, Japanese, Norwegian. German, Italian, Polish, Brazilian Portuguese and Chinese translation files. PR #2353.
  - French documentation updated by @Karduin. Issue #2360. PR #2361.
