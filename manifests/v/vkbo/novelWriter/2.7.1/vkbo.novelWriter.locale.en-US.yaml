  Release Notes
  This is a patch release that fixes some issues with tags and references, and issue with the auto-complete menu on Windows, and issues with the AppImage on Linux. The Czech translation for 2.7 has been completed.
  Detailed Changelog
  Bugfixes
  - Fix a bug where tags would be listed in the auto-complete menu for mentions even if the file defining it had been moved to Archive or Trash. Issue #2387. PR #2389.
  - Fixed a bug that seems to only have occurred on Windows where the auto-complete menu would hold on to the return and arrow keys even when it was hidden. Issue #2386. PR #2389.
  Improvements
  - The auto-complete menu in the editor no longer shows any suggestions when defining the tag. This never made sense anyway. PR #2389.
  Internationalisation
  - Updated the Czech. PR #2393.
  Packaging
  - Fixed an issue with the AppImage release where on some platforms libxcb-cursor0 was missing. The library is now included in the AppImage. Issue #2374. PR #2392.
