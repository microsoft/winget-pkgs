ShortDescription: A markdown-like editor for novels
Description: |-
  A markdown-like text editor designed for writing novels and larger projects of many smaller plain text documents.
  It is designed to be a simple text editor that allows for easy organisation of text files and notes, with a meta data syntax for comments, synopsis, and cross-referencing between files, and built on plain text files for robustness.
