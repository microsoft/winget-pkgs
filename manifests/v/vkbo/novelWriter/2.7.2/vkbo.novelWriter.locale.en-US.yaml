ShortDescription: A markdown-like editor for novels
Description: |-
  A markdown-like text editor designed for writing novels and larger projects of many smaller plain text documents.
  It is designed to be a simple text editor that allows for easy organisation of text files and notes, with a meta data syntax for comments, synopsis, and cross-referencing between files, and built on plain text files for robustness.

  Release Notes
  This is a patch release that fixes several issues related to DocX and PDF manuscript documents, improves how line breaks, alignment and indentation is processed, and fixes some issues with displaying tags for novel documents on the user interface.
  Detailed Changelog
  Bugfixes
  - Fixed an issue where escaped markup characters were not replaced properly in DocX and PDF documents, and in previews. Issue #2410. PR #2411.
  - Fixed an issue where titles with line breaks in them would have page breaks applied to both lines for preview and PDF documents. Issue #2415. PR #2416.
  - Fixed an issue where the justified text setting would not be properly applied to a paragraph in a manuscript document if there was a line break in the paragraph, but single line breaks were set to be ignored. Issue #2426. PR #2427.
  - Fixed an issue where the "Tag" field of the Outline View details panel remained blank even if a tag was set for the novel document. Issue #2428. PR #2429.
  Improvements
  - When comments are enabled in the viewer, story comments should also be visible. A separate filter button will be added for this in 2.8. PR #2420.
  - When a paragraph has line breaks in it, the alignment tag will now override first line indentation even if the alignment tag is not on the first line. This is more consistent with the alignment behaviour for multi-line paragraphs in general. Issue #2425. PR #2427.
  - Tags will now be shown in the Novel View tooltip pop-out under the triangle button, together with all the other meta data collected about a document or heading. PR #2429.
  Documentation
  - The documentation on how alignment and first line indentation works in conjunction with in-paragraph line breaks, the setting to keep or ignore such line breaks, and the forced line break shortcode, has been improved. Issue #2425. PR #2427.
