ReleaseNotes: |-
  Note
  Recently, Veracode container scans began failing due to a breaking change from one of our upstream data suppliers. This breaking change affected all versions of the Veracode CLI, including 2.43.0 and earlier.
  Veracode has expedited a new Container & IaC release to address the issue and recommends all customers upgrade to the latest release immediately.
  This breaking change only affected Container & IaC scanning. Other functions of the Veracode CLI, including Static scanning and Veracode Fix, were not affected.
  This update includes the following improvements:
  - The veracode scan command:
    - Allows you to apply a custom policy defined in the Veracode Platform.
    - Enables you to view policy evaluation for individual findings along with the overall policy result.
    - Introduces changes to the scan results schema.
    - Increases vulnerability coverage to improve scan performance.
    - Creates a separate asset for each repository in the ADO workflow, making it easier to track and view individual scan results.
  - Introduces the veracode package discover command to detect the toolchains required to successfully create scannable artifacts.
  - The veracode package command:
    - Produces no artifacts if the Python virtual environment is at the repository root. If it’s in a subdirectory or is a conda-meta environment, that directory is excluded from packaging.
    - Expects the python-no-pm artifact to be created from the root of the repository.
    - For .NET, passes TargetFrameworkVersion to the msbuild publish command only when multiple target framework versions are specified.
    - Preserves the source file name extension of preprocessed output files.
    - Improves logging of solution configuration and platform selection.
    - Eliminates an issue detecting the version of CL.exe from a legacy toolset when using a newer build environment.
    - Corrects an issue building projects with names containing ( or ) characters.
    - Prevents packaging failures when the input directory contains both supported and unsupported solutions.
    - Adds support for preprocessing C/C++ source files with Make on Windows using a native Windows gcc or clang compiler, via the SRCLR_MAKE_WINDOWS environment variable.
