ShortDescription: CLI tool which enables you to login and retrieve AWS temporary credentials using a SAML IDP
Description: |-
  CLI tool which enables you to login and retrieve AWS temporary credentials using with ADFS or PingFederate Identity Providers.
  This is based on python code from How to Implement a General Solution for Federated API/CLI Access Using SAML 2.0.
  The process goes something like this:
  - Setup an account alias, either using the default or given a name
  - Prompt user for credentials
  - Log in to Identity Provider using form based authentication
  - Build a SAML assertion containing AWS roles
  - Optionally cache the SAML assertion (the cache is not encrypted)
  - Exchange the role and SAML assertion with AWS STS service to get a temporary set of credentials
  - Save these credentials to an aws profile named "saml"
