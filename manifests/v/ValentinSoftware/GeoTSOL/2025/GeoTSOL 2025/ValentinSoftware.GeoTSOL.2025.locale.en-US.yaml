ShortDescription: The design and simulation software for heat pump systems.
Description: |-
  Are you looking for a professional and user-friendly software for the planning and design of heat pump systems? Then GeoT*SOL is the ideal tool for you.
  GeoT*SOL offers you the choice between different heat sources (soil, air and groundwater), operating modes (monovalent, monoenergetic and bivalent) and numerous system configurations for your location. The program allows for bivalent systems with boiler as heat generator as well as the integration of solar thermal systems and photovoltaic systems.
  Based on a dynamic minute simulation, electricity consumption, seasonal performance factors, operating costs and other system data can be calculated, taking into account blocking periods and tariffs. With these parameters, GeoT*SOL helps you to develop efficient and economical heat pump systems. Selected results can be conveniently incorporated into the project report for the client.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  The following new features and changes are included:
  - The design temperature is automatically set to the standard outdoor temperature (DIN/TS 12831-1 Part 1: National supplements) for locations in Germany. For all other locations, the coldest temperature from the climate data set is displayed and can be adopted as the design temperature.
  - The heating load and domestic hot water energy requirement are displayed in the project status.
  - Projects can be loaded, created or the last projects can be opened from the start page.
  - Elements can be shown and hidden on the interface to increase clarity.
  - Change in display of full load hours: All hours in which the maximum utilisation was reached at least briefly are now counted as full load hours.
  - Display of the source temperature for brine heat pumps in the sizing help diagram.
  - Project report supplemented with annual domestic hot water energy requirement and design temperature.
  - Search in database dialogue improved.
  - Databases have been updated.
  The following bugs have been fixed:
  - Intersection point in sizing help diagram partially incorrect.
  - Partial crashes after saving the project report.
  - The tank database dialogue also displayed manufacturers that had no tanks.
  - In the first simulation, the generator heat output was sometimes not set.
  - Changes to the domestic hot water tank of the WPA 8 were not adopted.
