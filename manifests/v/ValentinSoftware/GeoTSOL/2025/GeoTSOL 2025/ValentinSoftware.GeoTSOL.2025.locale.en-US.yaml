ShortDescription: The design and simulation software for heat pump systems.
Description: |-
  Are you looking for a professional and user-friendly software for the planning and design of heat pump systems? Then GeoT*SOL is the ideal tool for you.
  GeoT*SOL offers you the choice between different heat sources (soil, air and groundwater), operating modes (monovalent, monoenergetic and bivalent) and numerous system configurations for your location. The program allows for bivalent systems with boiler as heat generator as well as the integration of solar thermal systems and photovoltaic systems.
  Based on a dynamic minute simulation, electricity consumption, seasonal performance factors, operating costs and other system data can be calculated, taking into account blocking periods and tariffs. With these parameters, GeoT*SOL helps you to develop efficient and economical heat pump systems. Selected results can be conveniently incorporated into the project report for the client.
