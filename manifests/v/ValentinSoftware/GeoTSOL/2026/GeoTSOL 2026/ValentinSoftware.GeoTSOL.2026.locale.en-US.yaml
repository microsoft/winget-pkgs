ShortDescription: The design and simulation software for heat pump systems.
Description: |-
  Are you looking for a professional and user-friendly software for the planning and design of heat pump systems? Then GeoT*SOL is the ideal tool for you.
  GeoT*SOL offers you the choice between different heat sources (soil, air and groundwater), operating modes (monovalent, monoenergetic and bivalent) and numerous system configurations for your location. The program allows for bivalent systems with boiler as heat generator as well as the integration of solar thermal systems and photovoltaic systems.
  Based on a dynamic minute simulation, electricity consumption, seasonal performance factors, operating costs and other system data can be calculated, taking into account blocking periods and tariffs. With these parameters, GeoT*SOL helps you to develop efficient and economical heat pump systems. Selected results can be conveniently incorporated into the project report for the client.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  The following new features and changes are included:
  - The user is now warned if the selected heat pump is discarded when changing the heat source.
  - In the database dialog, heat pumps can now be sorted by flow temperature.
  - Updated climate data based on Meteonorm 9 (2001–2020).
  - The license management client has been updated (improved stability).
  The following bugs have been fixed:
  - Crash when entering incorrect values in the heat pump database dialog.
  - The calculation of domestic hot water requirements was performed despite incorrect input values.
  - The CO2 savings were not specified depending on the selected boiler (wood, natural gas, etc.).
  - In very cold locations, the X-axis in the bivalence point diagram was no longer legible.
  - In some cases, the bars in the results graphs were outside the diagram.
  - Warning in monovalent mode if the target temperatures were too high.
  - Some error messages were not translated into Czech.
  - The profile name was not translated in the project report.
