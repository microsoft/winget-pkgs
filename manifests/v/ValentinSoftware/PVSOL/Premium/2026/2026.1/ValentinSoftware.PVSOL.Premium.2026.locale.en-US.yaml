ShortDescription: The design and simulation software for photovoltaic systems – with 3D visualization and detailed shading analysis.
Description: |-
  With PV*SOL premium, the industry standard for photovoltaic design software, you can design and simulate all types of modern PV systems. From small rooftop systems with to medium-sized systems on commercial roofs to solar parks - PV*SOL premium supports you with numerous tools for design and simulation.
  The unique 3D visualization is the highlight of PV*SOL premium. You can visualize all common types of systems in 3D, whether roof-integrated or roof-mounted, whether on small angled roofs, large industrial halls or open spaces - with up to 7,500 mounted modules or up to 10,000 roof-parallel modules - and calculate the shading based on 3D objects. With the realistic shading from surrounding objects, you can achieve the highest reliability for your yield forecast.
  All other design types from PV*SOL are of course also available in PV*SOL premium. Whether calculating self-consumption, designing battery storage or integrating electric vehicles - with PV*SOL premium you can implement all customer wishes in no time at all.
  Our extensive product database includes over 26,000 PV modules, 7,500 inverters, 5,500 battery systems and many other products such as electric vehicles and performance optimizers. It is updated regularly by the product manufacturers themselves, so you can always work with the latest data.
  You can generate high-quality project reports for your customers that can be edited as required. Circuit diagrams with the necessary safety devices can also be created, e.g. for submission to the relevant authorities.
  The current feed-in tariffs are available in our database for the calculation of economic efficiency. By adding the information to the system costs, you will receive a detailed economic analysis of the system over 20 years. This allows you to create an initial offer in just a few minutes.
  PV*SOL premium is available in German 🇩🇪, English 🇬🇧, Spanish 🇪🇸, French 🇫🇷, Italian 🇮🇹, Polish 🇵🇱, Czech 🇨🇿, Portuguese 🇵🇹 and Turkish 🇹🇷. And with project reports available in 23 languages, language barriers are a thing of the past.
  Our technical support team and our help pages offer you assistance with your questions. In our forum you can address more complex questions to our team and other PV*SOL premium users.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  The following new features and changes are included:
  - New system type: “Grid-connected PV system with electrical appliances, thermal systems and battery systems”.
  - Multiple from-grid tariffs can now be selected and freely assigned to different consumers.
  - New compact project report with the most important simulation results.
  - New load profiles for air conditioning systems, working from home and retiree households.
  - Updated climate data based on Meteonorm 9 (2001–2020).
  - All result graphics can be added to the project report.
  - Project reports are now also available in Lithuanian.
  - Project data and results can be exported to a JSON file.
  - 3D:
    - Acceleration of shading simulation and shadow frequency calculation.
    - The OpenStreetMap provider has been removed from the map tool.
  - The profitability calculation dialog has been redesigned.
  - When importing consumer load profiles with a leap year, the correct number of values is now also output.
  - For time-controlled charging and discharging of battery systems, time periods extending beyond midnight can now also be entered.
  - When exporting the results to a CSV file, the formatting of the exported numbers has been standardized and is now without scientific notation.
  - With the introduction of the thermal systems plus battery system, it is no longer possible to select the “PV-optimized” heat pump operating mode.
  - Diagrams of the characteristic curves can no longer be added to the project report because this would make the project file too large.
  - It is currently not possible to generate climate data from your own monthly values.
  - The combination of time-controlled charging and DC generator-coupled battery systems is now prevented.
  - The license management client has been updated (improved stability).
  The following bugs have been fixed:
  - 3D:
    - Some plans that were no longer valid were not deleted.
    - In some cases, existing 3D models were duplicated when reopening the 3D visualization. Removing the duplicates caused a crash.
    - Crashes when loading projects with a large number of extruded objects.
    - Crashes when extruding polygons.
    - Incorrect shadow after importing and moving or rotating objects.
    - Some texts in the options dialog were not displayed correctly.
    - Artifacts when displaying the shade frequency distribution.
    - When opening the 3D visualization, the message “Silhouettes have been corrected” was displayed multiple times.
  - In the economic efficiency results, one year was missing from the cash flow table if the assessment period was longer than the remuneration period including solar peak compensation.
  - In some cases, the payback period was given as more than 100 years if it exceeded the observation period.
  - When opening the options dialog, the time step of the simulation was sometimes changed.
  - In some cases, the simulation (yield reduction due to shading) did not start if settings in the options were changed after a simulation was aborted.
  - Balance error in the simulation of time-controlled charging and DC-coupled battery systems.
  - In some cases, the simulation results were not displayed correctly after loading a project with solar peak compensation.
  - In some cases, it was no longer possible to load project files after updating the online database.
  - In some cases, the open-circuit voltage was too high after loading the project report several times.
  - Incorrect translations.
