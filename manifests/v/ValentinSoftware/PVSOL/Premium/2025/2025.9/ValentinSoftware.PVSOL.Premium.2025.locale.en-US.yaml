ShortDescription: The design and simulation software for photovoltaic systems – with 3D visualization and detailed shading analysis.
Description: |-
  With PV*SOL premium, the industry standard for photovoltaic design software, you can design and simulate all types of modern PV systems. From small rooftop systems with to medium-sized systems on commercial roofs to solar parks - PV*SOL premium supports you with numerous tools for design and simulation.
  The unique 3D visualization is the highlight of PV*SOL premium. You can visualize all common types of systems in 3D, whether roof-integrated or roof-mounted, whether on small angled roofs, large industrial halls or open spaces - with up to 7,500 mounted modules or up to 10,000 roof-parallel modules - and calculate the shading based on 3D objects. With the realistic shading from surrounding objects, you can achieve the highest reliability for your yield forecast.
  All other design types from PV*SOL are of course also available in PV*SOL premium. Whether calculating self-consumption, designing battery storage or integrating electric vehicles - with PV*SOL premium you can implement all customer wishes in no time at all.
  Our extensive product database includes over 26,000 PV modules, 7,500 inverters, 5,500 battery systems and many other products such as electric vehicles and performance optimizers. It is updated regularly by the product manufacturers themselves, so you can always work with the latest data.
  You can generate high-quality project reports for your customers that can be edited as required. Circuit diagrams with the necessary safety devices can also be created, e.g. for submission to the relevant authorities.
  The current feed-in tariffs are available in our database for the calculation of economic efficiency. By adding the information to the system costs, you will receive a detailed economic analysis of the system over 20 years. This allows you to create an initial offer in just a few minutes.
  PV*SOL premium is available in German 🇩🇪, English 🇬🇧, Spanish 🇪🇸, French 🇫🇷, Italian 🇮🇹, Polish 🇵🇱, Czech 🇨🇿, Portuguese 🇵🇹 and Turkish 🇹🇷. And with project reports available in 23 languages, language barriers are a thing of the past.
  Our technical support team and our help pages offer you assistance with your questions. In our forum you can address more complex questions to our team and other PV*SOL premium users.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  The following new features and changes are included:
  - Calculation of annual cash flow in combination with taxes and loans revised.
  - If a loan is used in the financial analysis, the results now also include the “Accrued Cash Flow (Cash Balance) minus pending loans” diagram.
  - The “Energy cost trend” diagram can now be selected or deselected for the project report.
  - The climate data from PVGIS has been updated to SARAH3.
  The following bugs have been fixed:
  - Financial Analysis:
    - In some cases, a heat pump was included in the calculation of savings, even though the system type did not include a heat pump.
    - In some cases, the charging of the electric car from the battery was not taken into account in the calculation of savings.
    - Error when loading the already simulated feed-in tariff in the first year when using DC battery systems and the Solar Peak Act calculation.
  - Off-grid systems:
    - Error when opening project files.
    - When the simulation is aborted, only a simple message is displayed instead of the crash window.
