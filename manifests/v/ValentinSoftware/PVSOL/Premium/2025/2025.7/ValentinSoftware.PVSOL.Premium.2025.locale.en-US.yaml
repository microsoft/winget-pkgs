ShortDescription: The design and simulation software for photovoltaic systems – with 3D visualization and detailed shading analysis.
Description: |-
  With PV*SOL premium, the industry standard for photovoltaic design software, you can design and simulate all types of modern PV systems. From small rooftop systems with to medium-sized systems on commercial roofs to solar parks - PV*SOL premium supports you with numerous tools for design and simulation.
  The unique 3D visualization is the highlight of PV*SOL premium. You can visualize all common types of systems in 3D, whether roof-integrated or roof-mounted, whether on small angled roofs, large industrial halls or open spaces - with up to 7,500 mounted modules or up to 10,000 roof-parallel modules - and calculate the shading based on 3D objects. With the realistic shading from surrounding objects, you can achieve the highest reliability for your yield forecast.
  All other design types from PV*SOL are of course also available in PV*SOL premium. Whether calculating self-consumption, designing battery storage or integrating electric vehicles - with PV*SOL premium you can implement all customer wishes in no time at all.
  Our extensive product database includes over 26,000 PV modules, 7,500 inverters, 5,500 battery systems and many other products such as electric vehicles and performance optimizers. It is updated regularly by the product manufacturers themselves, so you can always work with the latest data.
  You can generate high-quality project reports for your customers that can be edited as required. Circuit diagrams with the necessary safety devices can also be created, e.g. for submission to the relevant authorities.
  The current feed-in tariffs are available in our database for the calculation of economic efficiency. By adding the information to the system costs, you will receive a detailed economic analysis of the system over 20 years. This allows you to create an initial offer in just a few minutes.
  PV*SOL premium is available in German 🇩🇪, English 🇬🇧, Spanish 🇪🇸, French 🇫🇷, Italian 🇮🇹, Polish 🇵🇱, Czech 🇨🇿, Portuguese 🇵🇹 and Turkish 🇹🇷. And with project reports available in 23 languages, language barriers are a thing of the past.
  Our technical support team and our help pages offer you assistance with your questions. In our forum you can address more complex questions to our team and other PV*SOL premium users.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  The following new features and changes are included:
  - In the circuit diagram, the DC intermediate-coupled battery systems are now drawn on the DC side of hybrid inverters.
  - 3D map tool: Direct access to search provider Bing Maps removed.
  - MeteoSyn: In case of errors during the import of climate data, the possible error is now indicated.
  The following bugs have been fixed:
  - 3D:
    - Error when loading projects with exactly 7 modules on top of each other in a mounting system.
    - Partially floating modules when using Google Solar API and 3D models at the same time.
    - Partially incorrect display of half-cell modules.
  - Photo Plan:
    - Help could not be accessed with F1.
    - Missing translation when selecting roof tiles.
  - Diagram PV energy during observation period did not show the correct observation period for projects located outside Germany.
  - Partial problems with the diagrams for the economic calculation.
  - User profiles: The tooltips were “hard coded”.
  - The parameters "Year", "Month" and "Day" sometimes described a DateTime that could not be displayed.
  - Automatic configuration search sometimes did not deliver any results for the SMA Tripower Core 2.
  - In the project report, the minimum system operation period was not displayed if 100% loan capital was used.
  - Partial error in the cumulative cash flow if a loan was defined.
  - Error in the calculation of the last block in the cash flow table.
  - The power specification of the backup generator was incorrect in the circuit diagram.
