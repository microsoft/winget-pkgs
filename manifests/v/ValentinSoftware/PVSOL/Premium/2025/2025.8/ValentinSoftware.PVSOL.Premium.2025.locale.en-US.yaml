ShortDescription: The design and simulation software for photovoltaic systems â€“ with 3D visualization and detailed shading analysis.
Description: |-
  With PV*SOL premium, the industry standard for photovoltaic design software, you can design and simulate all types of modern PV systems. From small rooftop systems with to medium-sized systems on commercial roofs to solar parks - PV*SOL premium supports you with numerous tools for design and simulation.
  The unique 3D visualization is the highlight of PV*SOL premium. You can visualize all common types of systems in 3D, whether roof-integrated or roof-mounted, whether on small angled roofs, large industrial halls or open spaces - with up to 7,500 mounted modules or up to 10,000 roof-parallel modules - and calculate the shading based on 3D objects. With the realistic shading from surrounding objects, you can achieve the highest reliability for your yield forecast.
  All other design types from PV*SOL are of course also available in PV*SOL premium. Whether calculating self-consumption, designing battery storage or integrating electric vehicles - with PV*SOL premium you can implement all customer wishes in no time at all.
  Our extensive product database includes over 26,000 PV modules, 7,500 inverters, 5,500 battery systems and many other products such as electric vehicles and performance optimizers. It is updated regularly by the product manufacturers themselves, so you can always work with the latest data.
  You can generate high-quality project reports for your customers that can be edited as required. Circuit diagrams with the necessary safety devices can also be created, e.g. for submission to the relevant authorities.
  The current feed-in tariffs are available in our database for the calculation of economic efficiency. By adding the information to the system costs, you will receive a detailed economic analysis of the system over 20 years. This allows you to create an initial offer in just a few minutes.
  PV*SOL premium is available in German ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª, English ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§, Spanish ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸, French ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·, Italian ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹, Polish ðŸ‡µðŸ‡±, Czech ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¿, Portuguese ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹ and Turkish ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡·. And with project reports available in 23 languages, language barriers are a thing of the past.
  Our technical support team and our help pages offer you assistance with your questions. In our forum you can address more complex questions to our team and other PV*SOL premium users.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  The following new features and changes are included:
  - In the simulation with a thermal system, the maximum value for hot water consumption was increased to 1,000,000 kWh.
  The following bugs have been fixed:
  - 3D:
    - Partial crash when opening the 3D visualization if the Mounting surfaces of the 3D models were generated automatically.
    - Partial crash when opening the 3D visualization if the counting method of the module assignment in the project was incorrect.
    - Message before crash if imported 3D models cannot be loaded.
  - Financial analysis:
    - Date in the last block of the cashflow table if no EEG tariff is used and the observation period is shorter than the remuneration period.
    - Incorrect calculation of the annual cash flow if the tax option was used.
  - Circuit diagram:
    - Circuit diagram was sometimes not displayed correctly when 3D planning was used.
    - Crash when creating the circuit diagram.
  - Crash if no investment costs and tariffs have been defined in the financial analysis.
  - Crash on the inverter window if the power optimizer field was clicked first and then the inverter model field immediately afterwards.
  - Problems when entering degrees, minutes and seconds of coordinates in the map tool search.
