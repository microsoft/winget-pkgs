ShortDescription: The design and simulation software for photovoltaic systems â€“ with 3D visualization and detailed shading analysis.
Description: |-
  With PV*SOL premium, the industry standard for photovoltaic design software, you can design and simulate all types of modern PV systems. From small rooftop systems with to medium-sized systems on commercial roofs to solar parks - PV*SOL premium supports you with numerous tools for design and simulation.
  The unique 3D visualization is the highlight of PV*SOL premium. You can visualize all common types of systems in 3D, whether roof-integrated or roof-mounted, whether on small angled roofs, large industrial halls or open spaces - with up to 7,500 mounted modules or up to 10,000 roof-parallel modules - and calculate the shading based on 3D objects. With the realistic shading from surrounding objects, you can achieve the highest reliability for your yield forecast.
  All other design types from PV*SOL are of course also available in PV*SOL premium. Whether calculating self-consumption, designing battery storage or integrating electric vehicles - with PV*SOL premium you can implement all customer wishes in no time at all.
  Our extensive product database includes over 26,000 PV modules, 7,500 inverters, 5,500 battery systems and many other products such as electric vehicles and performance optimizers. It is updated regularly by the product manufacturers themselves, so you can always work with the latest data.
  You can generate high-quality project reports for your customers that can be edited as required. Circuit diagrams with the necessary safety devices can also be created, e.g. for submission to the relevant authorities.
  The current feed-in tariffs are available in our database for the calculation of economic efficiency. By adding the information to the system costs, you will receive a detailed economic analysis of the system over 20 years. This allows you to create an initial offer in just a few minutes.
  PV*SOL premium is available in German ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª, English ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§, Spanish ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸, French ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·, Italian ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹, Polish ðŸ‡µðŸ‡±, Czech ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¿, Portuguese ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹ and Turkish ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡·. And with project reports available in 23 languages, language barriers are a thing of the past.
  Our technical support team and our help pages offer you assistance with your questions. In our forum you can address more complex questions to our team and other PV*SOL premium users.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  The following new features and changes are included:
  - Interface to the software PV Configurator of the underconstruction manufacturer Renusol (Interface will be activated in the Renusol PV Configurator on 30.04.2025):
    - In the 3D planning, projects can be exported from PV*SOL premium to the Renusol PV Configurator.
    - The mounting systems and layout can then be planned in the PV Configurator and exported back to PV*SOL premium.
    - PV*SOL premium adopts the layout, the mounting system and the parts list from the Renusol PV Configurator.
  - Display of the amortization period is no longer limited to the observation period.
  - Photo Plan: Re-implementation of Braas roof tiles, Velux roof windows and measuring tools.
  - Improvement of the translation.
  The following bugs have been fixed:
  - 3D:
    - Manually entering the coordinates of a corner point for drawn polygons sometimes led to the position of other corner points also being changed.
    - When reloading a project, the number of automatically generated surfaces of a 3D model no longer matched the number when saved the project.
  - Error in the login dialog of the license management:
    - Login dialog did not respond.
    - Login dialog did not display any content.
  - Economic calculation:
    - Fix for unsaved hourly values of grid feed-in if hourly values were not saved in the project.
    - The diagram of the Development of Energy costs sometimes showed a peak in the last year of the observation period.
  - Partial crashes of the minute value synthesis at Brazilian locations.
