ShortDescription: The design and simulation software for photovoltaic systems.
Description: |-
  With PV*SOL you can deisgn and simulate all types of modern PV systems. From the small rooftop system with a few modules to medium-sized systems on commercial roofs to solar parks with up to 100,000 modules - PV*SOL supports you with numerous tools for design and simulation. Choose the type of design that best suits you and your PV project! The detailed results provide information about the performance of your system at all times.
  Whether calculating self-consumption, designing battery storage or integrating electric vehicles - with PV*SOL you can implement and present all customer wishes in no time at all.
  You can use our extensive product database at any time. It currently includes over 21,000 PV modules, 5,100 inverters, 1,900 battery systems and many other products such as electric vehicles and performance optimizers. It is updated regularly by the product manufacturers themselves, so that you can always work with the latest data.
  You can generate high-quality project reports for your customers that can be configured and edited as required. Circuit diagrams with the necessary safety devices can also be created, e.g. for submission to the relevant authorities.
  The current feed-in tariffs are already available in our database for the calculation of economic efficiency. Supplemented with the information on the system costs, you will receive a detailed and meaningful economic analysis of the plant over 20 years.
  This way you can get an initial offer in just a few minutes, which you can refine afterwards if the customer is interested.
  Our technical support team and our online help support you with open questions and in our forum you can put more complex questions to our team and other users of PV*SOL and quickly receive an answer.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  The following new features and changes are included:
  - New system type: “Grid-connected PV system with electrical appliances, thermal systems and battery systems”.
  - Multiple from-grid tariffs can now be selected and freely assigned to different consumers.
  - New compact project report with the most important simulation results.
  - New load profiles for air conditioning systems, working from home and retiree households.
  - In the consumption dialog, the load profiles from measured values are now displayed in groups.
  - When importing consumer load profiles with a leap year, the correct number of values is now also output.
  - Updated climate data based on Meteonorm 9 (2001–2020).
  - All result graphics can be added to the project report.
  - Project reports are now also available in Lithuanian.
  - Project data and results can be exported to a JSON file.
  - The financial analysis parameters dialog has been redesigned.
  - For time-controlled charging and discharging of battery systems, time periods extending beyond midnight can now also be entered.
  - When exporting the results to a CSV file, the formatting of the exported numbers has been standardized and is now without scientific notation.
  - In the circuit diagram, circuit symbols can now also be inserted in front of AC battery systems and electric vehicles (only if the vehicle does not have its own from-grid tariff).
  - When exporting plans, the type of plan is now appended to the file name.
  - With the introduction of the thermal systems plus battery system, it is no longer possible to select the “PV-optimized” heat pump operating mode.
  - Diagrams of the characteristic curves can no longer be added to the project report because this would make the project file too large.
  - It is currently not possible to generate climate data from your own monthly values.
  - The combination of time-controlled charging and DC generator-coupled battery systems is now prevented.
  - The license management client has been updated (improved stability).
  The following bugs have been fixed:
  - In the economic efficiency results, one year was missing from the cash flow table if the assessment period was longer than the remuneration period including solar peak compensation.
  - In some cases, the payback period was given as more than 100 years if it exceeded the observation period.
  - When opening the options dialog, the time step of the simulation was sometimes changed.
  - In some cases, the simulation (yield reduction due to shading) did not start if settings in the options were changed after a simulation was aborted.
  - Balance error in the simulation of time-controlled charging and DC-coupled battery systems.
  - In some cases, the simulation results were not displayed correctly after loading a project with solar peak compensation.
  - In some cases, it was no longer possible to load project files after updating the online database.
  - In some cases, the open-circuit voltage was too high after loading the project report several times.
  - Crash when loading projects from program version 2025 with solar peak law that were not simulated.
  - Partial crashes on the welcome page when the program was closed.
  - Crash when loading projects with battery systems or electric vehicles if there was more than one group and results were already available.
  - Partial crashes in the dialog for selecting load profiles.
  - Correction of the display of the discharge power of electric vehicles (factor 1000).
  - A payback period of “1 year and 12 months” is now displayed as “2 years”.
  - In off-grid projects, the battery system was not displayed correctly in the circuit diagram.
  - Crash on the project report page when there were errors (e.g., a bitmap that was too large) in the circuit diagram.
  - Crash in “New Project” when multiple battery system groups were used but the first group was not selected.
  - Problems displaying the design bar for very high power ratings and consumption.
  - Incorrect translations.
