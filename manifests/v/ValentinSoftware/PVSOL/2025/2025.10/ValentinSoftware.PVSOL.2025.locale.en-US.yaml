ShortDescription: The design and simulation software for photovoltaic systems.
Description: |-
  With PV*SOL you can deisgn and simulate all types of modern PV systems. From the small rooftop system with a few modules to medium-sized systems on commercial roofs to solar parks with up to 100,000 modules - PV*SOL supports you with numerous tools for design and simulation. Choose the type of design that best suits you and your PV project! The detailed results provide information about the performance of your system at all times.
  Whether calculating self-consumption, designing battery storage or integrating electric vehicles - with PV*SOL you can implement and present all customer wishes in no time at all.
  You can use our extensive product database at any time. It currently includes over 21,000 PV modules, 5,100 inverters, 1,900 battery systems and many other products such as electric vehicles and performance optimizers. It is updated regularly by the product manufacturers themselves, so that you can always work with the latest data.
  You can generate high-quality project reports for your customers that can be configured and edited as required. Circuit diagrams with the necessary safety devices can also be created, e.g. for submission to the relevant authorities.
  The current feed-in tariffs are already available in our database for the calculation of economic efficiency. Supplemented with the information on the system costs, you will receive a detailed and meaningful economic analysis of the plant over 20 years.
  This way you can get an initial offer in just a few minutes, which you can refine afterwards if the customer is interested.
  Our technical support team and our online help support you with open questions and in our forum you can put more complex questions to our team and other users of PV*SOL and quickly receive an answer.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  The following new features and changes are included:
  - Calculation of annual cash flow in combination with taxes and loans revised.
  - If a loan is used in the financial analysis, the results now also include the “Accrued Cash Flow (Cash Balance) minus pending loans” diagram.
  - The “Energy cost trend” diagram can now be selected or deselected for the project report.
  - The climate data from PVGIS has been updated to SARAH3.
  - Revised calculation of direct own use of PV energy for DC intermediate circuit-coupled battery systems with time-controlled charging from the grid.
  - When planning with a DC intermediate circuit-coupled battery system with time-controlled charging and the energy at the inverter input is less than the charge of the DC storage, the Sankey diagram is no longer displayed in the results. This can occur if the DC storage is also charged from the grid.
  The following bugs have been fixed:
  - Financial Analysis:
    - In some cases, a heat pump was included in the calculation of savings, even though the system type did not include a heat pump.
    - In some cases, the charging of the electric car from the battery was not taken into account in the calculation of savings.
    - Error when loading the already simulated feed-in tariff in the first year when using DC battery systems and the Solar Peak Act calculation.
  - Off-grid systems:
    - Error when opening project files.
    - When the simulation is aborted, only a simple message is displayed instead of the crash window.
  - Crash when opening the Results page if a project from the previous version is loaded in which the simulation results were saved.
  - Error in the display of data series from thermal systems when exporting to a *.csv file.
