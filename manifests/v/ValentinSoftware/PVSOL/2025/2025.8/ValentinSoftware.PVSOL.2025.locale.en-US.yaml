ShortDescription: The design and simulation software for photovoltaic systems.
Description: |-
  With PV*SOL you can deisgn and simulate all types of modern PV systems. From the small rooftop system with a few modules to medium-sized systems on commercial roofs to solar parks with up to 100,000 modules - PV*SOL supports you with numerous tools for design and simulation. Choose the type of design that best suits you and your PV project! The detailed results provide information about the performance of your system at all times.
  Whether calculating self-consumption, designing battery storage or integrating electric vehicles - with PV*SOL you can implement and present all customer wishes in no time at all.
  You can use our extensive product database at any time. It currently includes over 21,000 PV modules, 5,100 inverters, 1,900 battery systems and many other products such as electric vehicles and performance optimizers. It is updated regularly by the product manufacturers themselves, so that you can always work with the latest data.
  You can generate high-quality project reports for your customers that can be configured and edited as required. Circuit diagrams with the necessary safety devices can also be created, e.g. for submission to the relevant authorities.
  The current feed-in tariffs are already available in our database for the calculation of economic efficiency. Supplemented with the information on the system costs, you will receive a detailed and meaningful economic analysis of the plant over 20 years.
  This way you can get an initial offer in just a few minutes, which you can refine afterwards if the customer is interested.
  Our technical support team and our online help support you with open questions and in our forum you can put more complex questions to our team and other users of PV*SOL and quickly receive an answer.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  The following new features and changes are included:
  - German “Solarspitzengesetz” (Solar Peak Act) can now be mapped in the economic efficiency.
  - Revised cashflow table:
  - Year 1 is now a full year.
  - The last year may only be part of a year.
  - The period of each year shown is listed.
  - Display of the amortization period is no longer limited to the observation period.
  - Photo Plan: Re-implementation of Braas roof tiles, Velux roof windows and measuring tools.
  - In the circuit diagram, the DC intermediate-coupled battery systems are now drawn on the DC side of hybrid inverters.
  - MeteoSyn: In case of errors during the import of climate data, the possible error is now indicated.
  - In the simulation with a thermal system, the maximum value for hot water consumption was increased to 1,000,000 kWh.
  - Improvement of the translation.
  - New offline database.
  The following bugs have been fixed:
  - Crash in the simulation if the inverter characteristic curve only showed a value of over 0 % at a utilization rate of 10 %.
  - Charging the e-vehicle from the battery system was not shown in the coverage of total consumption diagram.
  - Licence management issue with error 401.
  - Error in the login dialog of the license management:
  - Login dialog did not respond.
  - Login dialog did not display any content.
  - Energy flow diagram:
  - Display of energy flows from battery to electric car corrected.
  - Error in balancing when using heating element.
  - Error when saving the project files if characteristic curves should also be saved.
  - Crash in the assignment of DC charge controller and inverter connections when using more than 10 DC battery systems.
  - Crash in the characteristic curves if there was no PV yield in individual months.
  - Partial crashes of the minute value synthesis at Brazilian locations.
  - Photo Plan: Help could not be accessed with F1.
  - Diagram PV energy during observation period did not show the correct observation period for projects located outside Germany.
  - Partial problems with the diagrams for the economic calculation.
  - User profiles: The tooltips were “hard coded”.
  - The parameters "Year", "Month" and "Day" sometimes described a DateTime that could not be displayed.
  - Automatic configuration search sometimes did not deliver any results for the SMA Tripower Core 2.
  - The power specification of the backup generator was incorrect in the circuit diagram.
  - Crash on the inverter window if the power optimizer field was clicked first and then the inverter model field immediately afterwards.
  - Problems when entering degrees, minutes and seconds of coordinates in the map tool search.
