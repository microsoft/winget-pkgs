ShortDescription: The design and simulation software for photovoltaic systems.
Description: |-
  With PV*SOL you can deisgn and simulate all types of modern PV systems. From the small rooftop system with a few modules to medium-sized systems on commercial roofs to solar parks with up to 100,000 modules - PV*SOL supports you with numerous tools for design and simulation. Choose the type of design that best suits you and your PV project! The detailed results provide information about the performance of your system at all times.
  Whether calculating self-consumption, designing battery storage or integrating electric vehicles - with PV*SOL you can implement and present all customer wishes in no time at all.
  You can use our extensive product database at any time. It currently includes over 21,000 PV modules, 5,100 inverters, 1,900 battery systems and many other products such as electric vehicles and performance optimizers. It is updated regularly by the product manufacturers themselves, so that you can always work with the latest data.
  You can generate high-quality project reports for your customers that can be configured and edited as required. Circuit diagrams with the necessary safety devices can also be created, e.g. for submission to the relevant authorities.
  The current feed-in tariffs are already available in our database for the calculation of economic efficiency. Supplemented with the information on the system costs, you will receive a detailed and meaningful economic analysis of the plant over 20 years.
  This way you can get an initial offer in just a few minutes, which you can refine afterwards if the customer is interested.
  Our technical support team and our online help support you with open questions and in our forum you can put more complex questions to our team and other users of PV*SOL and quickly receive an answer.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  The following new features and changes are included:
  - Buttons for copying results tables and diagrams.
  - Copy & Paste in the parts list now only copies the selected cells.
  - Specific CO2 emissions are set to 380 g/kWh.
  - Currents and voltages are now grouped during CSV export.
  - Guernsey and Jersey added to MeteoSyn country list.
  The following bugs have been fixed:
  - Error when averaging 10- and 15-minute values in *.csv export.
  - Crash when starting different PV*SOL variants and versions at the same time.
  - Crash when exiting the financial analysis parameter dialog if the term and repayment free initial period year were set to the same value.
  - Crash when simulating with bifacial modules and row spacing 0 m.
  - Opening the options for *.csv export did not force a new simulation when changing the time step.
  - Simulation progress dialog could no longer be closed with "Alt+F4".
  - Error in checking the charging power for electric vehicles.
  - Carpet plots in the project report are now prevented if simulation results are not available.
  - Rare crash in calculation of DC power of DC-coupled battery systems.
  - In some cases, the initialization file for the license management could not be deserialized.
  - Error when using tracker systems for locations in the southern hemisphere.
  - Display of the PV modules page in French, Spanish, Portuguese and Italian partially incorrect.
  - Changing the country of the climate data led to the deletion of the financial analysis data for off-grid systems.
  - The energy balance entries for power optimizers were not correctly labelled during *.csv export.
  - Crash when defining a new PV module if the current or voltage in the MPP was higher than the short-circuit current or open-circuit voltage.
  - Incorrect interpolation of power optimizer curves between negative and positive power consumption.
  - Crash when starting PV*SOL due to IPC timing problem.
  - When using battery systems with batteries based on lithium nickel manganese oxide, negative losses could occur in the battery.
  - Main window no longer disappears into the background when MeteoSyn is called up.
  - Simulation of time-controlled charging for DC-coupled battery systems was not possible.
  - Error in the system check with Huawei optimizers.
  - New license management:
    - Crash when starting PV*SOL (UUID not available on some computers).
    - Crash if the license file could not be written.
