  updated the supported python versions to 3.12 and 3.8

  fixed backslashes and linebreaks not being properly escaped in dot graph output
  copyframeprops can now optionally copy only a subset of properties
  removeframeprops function now accepts wildcards in property names
  added prop_src argument to shuffleplanes
  added an access pattern mode when only repeatedly requesting the last frame of a clip
  added approximate_gamma option to resizers (saindriches)
  added plugin_path property to plugin object in python
  audio is now clamped instead of wrapped around in audiomix and audiogain, these functions can also now warn when clipping happens
  the vfw wrapper now provides simple waveformatex information automatically if the audio is mono or flagged as plain stereo and samples contain no padding bits

  added new frame request pattern where only the last frame is requested multiple times to further improve cache usage
  added new api functions for cache clearing
  fixed request pattern set for selectevery with multiple identical offsets
  fixed request pattern set for premultiply
  expose number of bytes used by cache in python and clean up version and str representations of things (setsugennoao)
