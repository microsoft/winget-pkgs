Description: |-
  Proxifier allows network applications that do not support working through proxy servers to operate through a SOCKS or HTTPS proxy or a chain of proxy servers.
  With Proxifier, you can easily tunnel all a system’s TCP connections or only those you select.

  Proxifier allows you to
  - run any network application through a proxy server. The software requires no special configuration, and the entire process is completely transparent
  - access the internet from a restricted network through a proxy server gateway
  - bypass firewall restrictions
  - "tunnel" the entire system (force all network connections, including system connections, to work through a proxy server)
  - resolve DNS names through a proxy server
  - use flexible Proxification Rules with hostname and application name wildcards
  - ensure privacy by hiding your IP address
  - work through a chain of proxy servers using diverse protocols
  - view real-time information on current network activities (connections, hosts, times, bandwidth usage, etc.)
  - maintain log files and traffic dumps
  - get detailed reports on network errors
  - and much more!
  Specifications:
  - Proxy protocols: SOCKS4, SOCKS4A, SOCKS5, HTTPS, and HTTP (HTTP connections only)
  - Authentication: SOCKS5 username/password authentication (RFC 1929), HTTP Basic, NTLM (including transparent mode), Kerberos
