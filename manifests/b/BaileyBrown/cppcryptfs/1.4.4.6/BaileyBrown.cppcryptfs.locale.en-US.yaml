ShortDescription: cppcryptfs is an implementation of the gocryptfs encrypted overlay filesystem in C++ for Windows.
ReleaseNotes: |-
  This release is mainly to fix a bug where cppcrytfsctl was not displaying Unicode characters (issue #206).
  Also, Dokany has been updated to the latest version 2.3.0.1000.
  This release requires Dokany 2.2.x. It will not work with Dokany 1.x.

  There is no installation program for cppcryptfs. Just save it somewhere (could be on your desktop) and run it from there.
  The executables are signed by the developer and are for 32/64-bit Windows 7 and higher.
  The 64-bit version (cppcryptfs.exe) requires 64-bit Windows. The 32-bit version (cppcryptfs32.exe) will run on either 32 or 64-bit Windows, but it is recommended to use the 64-bit version of cppcryptfs on 64-bit Windows.
  You can rename the 32-bit version to cppcryptfs.exe after downloading it if you wish.
  The binaries are signed with the developer's Open Source Developer code-signing certificate. Unfortunately, unless software signed with this type of certificate is really popular and downloaded a lot, Microsoft still treats it with suspicion and will probably throw up a warning dialog when you try to run it. If you click "More Info" and then "Run Anyway", it will run. This warning will not happen on subsequent runs.
