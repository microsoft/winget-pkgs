ReleaseNotes: |-
  hello! it has been a very long time since a bespoke release, but it's finally time for bespoke 1.2.0.

  the addition of the bespoke's nightly build system back in december 2021 (thanks baconpaul!) reduced a lot of my motivation to do releases (since people were always able to grab the latest and greatest), and "let me just add one more thing first" syndrome really pushed the timeline out on this thing, but it's finally time to put a stake in the ground and call this a stable release. take a look at CHANGELOG.md for a more thorough breakdown of all additions since 1.1.0, but here are some highlights:

  new modules:
  - clockin/clockout: sync bespoke tempo to other devices via midi clock
  - abletonlink: sync bespoke's tempo to ableton link-enabled apps
  - songbuilder: pattern control interface to help you turn loops into songs (similar to a tracker's pattern sequencer, but bespokified)
  - timelinecontrol: take control of bespoke's timeline position
  - buffershuffler: a new stutter-like tool for slicing up live audio on a grid
  - ...plus a bunch of other utility modules

  other cool stuff:
  - added right-click quickspawn menu system to improve module spawning workflow
  - added "drag cable into space" spawn system to speed up patch building workflow
  - many significant additions to push 2 controller integration
  - renamed presets module to snapshots module, and reframed it to be more useful as a performance/sequencing tool
  - added a bunch of OSC support
  - added looping deterministic modes to notechance, notehocket, and other randomization-driven modules

  also, fixed a bunch of bugs and crashes.

  enjoy!
