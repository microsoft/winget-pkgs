  🐛 Bug Fixes
  Fixed: TUI/Web UI showing incorrect total file size
  - Issue: Total download size would start at 8GB, then jump to 35GB, then 214GB during download
  - Cause: plan_item events were emitted incrementally during download loop, not upfront
  - Fix: All plan_item events are now emitted immediately after scanning, before downloads start
  Fixed: Settings not taking effect in Web UI
  - Issue: Changing settings (connections, max-active, retries, etc.) had no effect on downloads
  - Cause: Settings were hardcoded in multiple places; serve command was missing flags
  - Fix:
    - Added MultipartThreshold, Verify, Retries fields to server Config
    - Added --multipart-threshold, --verify, --retries flags to serve command
    - Web UI now fetches settings from server on page load (authoritative source)
  Fixed: Plan API missing Excludes and Endpoint
  - Issue: Preview/plan requests didn't respect exclude patterns or custom endpoint
  - Fix: Added Excludes, AppendFilterSubdir to job and Endpoint to settings in plan handler
