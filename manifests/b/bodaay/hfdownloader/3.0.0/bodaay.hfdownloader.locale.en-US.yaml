  Release Notes - v3.0.0
  Release Date: January 2026
  The HuggingFace-Native Release
  Highlights
  Version 3.0.0 is a major release that brings full HuggingFace CLI compatibility. Your downloads are now stored in the standard HuggingFace cache structure, making them instantly accessible to Transformers, Diffusers, and any other HuggingFace-based tools.

  New Features
  HuggingFace Cache Structure (Default)
  Downloads now go directly to ~/.cache/huggingface/hub/ - the same location used by huggingface_hub, Transformers, and other HuggingFace tools.
  # Download a model - it's immediately available to Transformers
  hfdownloader download microsoft/DialoGPT-medium

  # Use it directly in Python - no copying needed!
  from transformers import AutoModel
  model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("microsoft/DialoGPT-medium")
  Dual-Layer Storage
  Get the best of both worlds:
  - HuggingFace cache: Content-addressable blobs for deduplication
  - Human-readable symlinks: Easy file browsing at ~/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--{owner}--{repo}/snapshots/{revision}/
  Multi-Revision Support
  Download specific branches, tags, or commits:
  # Download a specific branch
  hfdownloader download TheBloke/Mistral-7B-GGUF --revision main

  # Download a specific tag
  hfdownloader download owner/repo --revision v1.0.0
  Model Analysis
  Understand models before downloading with the new analyze command:
  hfdownloader analyze microsoft/DialoGPT-medium
  Shows:
  - Model architecture and framework
  - File types and sizes
  - Quantization formats available
  - Recommended filters for your use case
  Enhanced Web UI
  - Revision picker - Select branches/tags from a dropdown
  - Model analysis - Analyze before downloading
  - Cache browser - Explore your local HuggingFace cache
  - Authentication - Secure your web server with --auth-user and --auth-pass
  Web Authentication
  Secure your web server when exposing to networks:
  hfdownloader serve --auth-user admin --auth-pass secret
  Legacy Mode
  Still need the old flat directory structure? Use --legacy:
  hfdownloader download TheBloke/Mistral-7B-GGUF --legacy -o ./models

  Docker
  Docker images are now automatically published to GitHub Container Registry:
  # Pull the image
  docker pull ghcr.io/bodaay/huggingfacemodeldownloader:3.0.0

  # Run with HuggingFace cache mount
  docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 \
    -v ~/.cache/huggingface:/home/hfdownloader/.cache/huggingface \
    ghcr.io/bodaay/huggingfacemodeldownloader:3.0.0 serve

  Quick Start
  # Analyze a model (no download)
  bash <(curl -sSL https://g.bodaay.io/hfd) analyze TheBloke/Mistral-7B-GGUF

  # Download Q4_K_M quantization only
  bash <(curl -sSL https://g.bodaay.io/hfd) download TheBloke/Mistral-7B-GGUF:q4_k_m

  # Start web UI with authentication
  bash <(curl -sSL https://g.bodaay.io/hfd) serve --auth-user admin --auth-pass secret

  # Install permanently
  bash <(curl -sSL https://g.bodaay.io/hfd) -i

  Migration from V2
  V3 uses a different storage structure by default. Your V2 downloads remain intact.
  Option 1: Keep using legacy mode for existing workflows
  hfdownloader download owner/repo --legacy -o ./models
  Option 2: Re-download to HuggingFace cache (recommended)
  # New downloads go to ~/.cache/huggingface/hub/ by default
  hfdownloader download owner/repo

  Breaking Changes
  - Default storage location changed: Downloads now go to ~/.cache/huggingface/hub/ instead of ./Models/
  - Directory structure changed: Uses HuggingFace blob/symlink structure instead of flat files
  -  -o flag behavior changed: In V3 mode, sets HF_HOME; in legacy mode, sets direct output path
