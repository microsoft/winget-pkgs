  Release Notes - v2.3.0
  Release Date: December 31, 2025
  🎉 Highlights
  This is a major release introducing a brand new Web UI, complete project restructuring, and numerous bug fixes. The project has been reorganized into a clean, modular architecture following Go best practices.

  ✨ New Features
  🌐 Web Interface
  - Beautiful Terminal-Noir themed Web UI for managing downloads
  - Real-time progress updates via WebSocket
  - Separate pages for downloading Models and Datasets
  - Per-file progress bars with live status updates
  - Settings management (connections, retries, verification mode)
  - Job deduplication - prevents duplicate downloads of the same repo
  🚀 One-Liner Web Mode
  Start the web UI instantly with:
  bash <(curl -sSL https://g.bodaay.io/hfd) -w
  Automatically opens your browser to http://localhost:8080
  🔧 New CLI Commands
  - hfdownloader serve - Start the web server
  - hfdownloader version - Show version information
  - hfdownloader config - Manage configuration
  📦 Reusable Go Package
  The downloader is now available as an importable package:
  import "github.com/bodaay/HuggingFaceModelDownloader/pkg/hfdownloader"

  🐛 Bug Fixes
  Fixed: "error: tree API failed: 400 Bad Request"
  - Repository paths with slashes (e.g., Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B) were being incorrectly URL-escaped
  - Now correctly handles repo IDs without double-escaping the slash
  Fixed: TUI Speed/ETA Display Jumping Around
  - Implemented Exponential Moving Average (EMA) for smooth speed calculations
  - Added minimum time interval (50ms) before recalculating speed
  - Both per-file and overall speeds are now stable and readable
  Fixed: TUI Total File Size Fluctuating
  - File totals no longer get overwritten with incorrect values during progress updates
  - Now only updates total if a valid value is provided
  Fixed: Downloads Appearing Stuck
  - Removed blocking HEAD requests during repository scanning
  - Large repos (90+ files) now start downloading within seconds instead of minutes
  - Assumed LFS files support range requests (they always do on HuggingFace)
  Fixed: Web UI Progress Not Updating
  - Added progressReader wrapper for real-time progress during single-file downloads
  - Progress events now use correct Downloaded field (cumulative bytes)
  - UI throttled to 10fps to prevent DOM thrashing

  🏗️ Architecture Changes
  Project Structure
  The codebase has been completely reorganized:
  ├── cmd/hfdownloader/     # CLI entry point
  ├── internal/
  │   ├── cli/              # CLI commands (Cobra)
  │   ├── server/           # Web server & API
  │   ├── tui/              # Terminal UI
  │   └── assets/           # Embedded web assets
  ├── pkg/hfdownloader/     # Reusable download library
  └── scripts/              # Installation scripts
  Security Improvements
  - Output path is server-controlled - Cannot be changed via API or Web UI
  - Separate directories for models (./Models/) and datasets (./Datasets/)
  - Token is never logged or exposed in API responses
  Testing
  - Comprehensive unit tests for JobManager, API handlers, and WebSocket
  - Integration tests for end-to-end download flows
  - Test coverage for job deduplication and cancellation

  📊 Performance Improvements
  Improvement Before After
  Large repo scan (90+ files) 5+ minutes ~2 seconds
  Progress update frequency 1 second 200ms
  Speed display stability Jumpy/erratic Smooth (EMA)
  Web UI responsiveness Laggy Throttled 10fps

  🔄 Breaking Changes
  - Main package moved from hfdownloader/ to pkg/hfdownloader/
  - CLI now uses Cobra commands instead of flags-only
  - main.go replaced with cmd/hfdownloader/main.go
  - Old makefile replaced with build.sh
