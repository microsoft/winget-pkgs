  What's Changed
  Sorry, this is not the FSR4 update
  Work was still continuing on FSR4 as well as a new feature called DLL Sets to enable swapping multiple DLLs at once. Keep an eye out for v1.2.4 though! (sorry again)
  Changelog
  - Fixed bug where manifest would be replaced with inbuilt manifest, meaning DLSS v310.5.2 would disapear on every launch.
  - Changed app to update manifest every launch, not once every 3 hours.
  - Renamed DLSS preset "Always use latest" to "NVIDIA recommended" to be in line with NVIDIA App
