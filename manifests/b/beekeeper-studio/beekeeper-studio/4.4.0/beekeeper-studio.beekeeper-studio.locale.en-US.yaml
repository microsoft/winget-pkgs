ReleaseNotes: |-
  A new release of Beekeeper Studio is out, version 4.4. This release includes support for Azure SSO, LibSQL, and a bunch of bug fixes. It's getting hot here in Texas, so our releases will be getting hotter too ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥.
  Headline Features
  Azure SSO Support for SQL Server
  We've added support for Azure SQL Single Sign On. You can now authenticate with Azure SQL using your Azure Active Directory credentials.
  This makes it easier to connect to Azure SQL databases, and is a feature that many of our users have been asking for.
  LibSQL Support
  We've added support for LibSQL. LibSQL is a fork of SQLite which is designed to expand the scope and capabilities of SQLite to include remote hosted SQLite, and built-in automatic replication of local files. It's pretty cool (and MIT licensed).
  libSQL is maintained by Turso, which offers a managed version of libSQL and whose mission it is to build SQLite for production in modern distributed applications.
  Other Changes
  - Fixed a bug that prevented some users from properly using Beekeeper for cassandra connections
  - Added filters to the connections and saved query sidebars
  - Fixed a bug that caused the query canceled icon to not show up
  - Fixed a bug that caused the launcher to not work on Ubuntu
  - Added a SQL import feature to import a bunch of .sql files into Beekeeper Studio
