ReleaseNotes: |-
  Headline Features
  1. DuckDB support
  2. MongoDB (read only) support
  3. Column reordering on the structure view
  4. RPM, Flatpak, and AUR installers for Linux
  That's right, DuckDB has landed. Using DuckDB you can query a whole range of files - CSV files, Parquet files, or even other databases!
  Also - MongoDB! Since this is our first NoSQL database, Mongo is going to require a lot of experimentation and feedback from our users. Let us know what you think! Right now we only support our read-only features, but we're working on queries, data editing, and a lot more.
  We also have a whole bunch of other great minor features and bug fixes in this release: Minor Additions
  - Fixed some bugs with Redshift queries
  - Fixed some null serialization issues with binary columns
  - Fixed a bunch of minor SQLite bugs like read-only mode not enabling in some situations
  - No more BigInt truncation
  - Adding databases for SQLite is now working right
  - Fixed a few race conditions causing issues in the query editor and the JSON row viewer
  - Added some missing functionality for Cassandra
  - Some fixes for BigQuery and Oracle
