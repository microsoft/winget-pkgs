ReleaseNotes: |-
  Lots of huge new features in this release
  1. Full MongoDB support - including the MongoDB Shell and SQL.
  2. SAP SQL Anywhere support
  3. Several formerly paid features are not free
  4. Enhanced JSON Sidebar features
  5. Privacy Mode (hide secrets when sharing screen)
  Full MongoDB Support
  Yes our first NoSQL database integration is done ðŸ“Œ!
  We've had to customize the app a lot to work with MongoDB, but it was worth it. Here are the most useful features of Beekeeper Studio's new MongoDB integration:
  MongoDB Shell
  The honest-to-goodness legit official MongoDB shell implementation is now available in Beekeeper Studio as a new tab type.
  Beekeeper Studio can easily tabulate data when you're querying. by default if you run a find or findOne it'll show the results in an easy to browse table, but you can always print values to see them directly in the shell too.
  SQL for MongoDB
  To support SQL on MongoDB we've written our own open source SQL to MongoDB transpiler from scratch to support PostgreSQL dialect SQL execution.
  If you look closely to the screenshot, notice that you can access object values with an intuitive dot notation, like address.zip. This is a slight break from PostgreSQL dialect SQL, but provides a significant usability upgrade for Mongo.
  Now for example you can write SELECT address.zip rather than something ugly like SELECT JSON_EXTRACT(address, 'zip') as zip
  SAP SQL Anywhere
  SQL Anywhere is an embedded database system originally developed by Sybase before they were acquired by SAP. It's similar to SQLite in that by default it reads and writes to self-contained files. Unlike SQLite SAP also provides a way to run SQL Anywhere in server mode, like a 'regular' database.
  Beekeeper Studio supports both of these connection methods
  Paid Features That Are Now Free
  We're now routinely reviewing paid features and moving some to the free tier whenever we can.
  The following formerly paid features are now free for everyone:
  - Solarized themes (and any future themes)
  - Query Magics
  Enhanced JSON Sidebar
  The JSON sidebar has been a big hit, but v1 had some limitations. We've fixed many of these limitations for the v5.2 release.
  - Edit data in the sidebar!
  - The sidebar works for query results
  - Auto-JSON conversion for json-stored-as-text/varchar data
  Smaller Additions
  - Offline license files for air-gapped systems.
  - Privacy mode - hide sensitive information for when you are sharing your screen
  - Reopen recently closed tabs.
  - Open tabs now show by default in the quick-search (like in VSCode).
  - Loads of bug fixes and minor tweaks.
