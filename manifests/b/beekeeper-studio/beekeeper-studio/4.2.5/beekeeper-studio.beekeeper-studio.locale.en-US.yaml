ReleaseNotes: |-
  We've spent the first few months of the year working on resolving small complaints, fixing bugs, and smoothing rough edges.In particular we've made maintaining the two different apps a lot easier by moving a lot of code into the open source repo.That said there's a LOT of stuff in this release.Headline features
  - One tab per table - Ok fine, you all asked for this, now we only allow one tab open per table. :-)
  - Firebird support - The Ultimate edition now has support for the Firebird database engine
  - SQLite duplicate column bug fix - you can now select two columns with the same name without them becoming a single column
  - .sql file import - In the saved queries section you can now import .sql files into your saved queries.
  - Better drag/drop support for .sql files - drag and drop a .sql file anywhere to open in a new query tab
  Loads of other stuff
  - Show/hide your database passwords with a little eye button
  - Spreadsheet mode improvements - better resizing, multi-select, and range select behavior.
  - Some regression fixes
  - Generated columns are now shown and correctly labelled
  - Exactly 3 bajillion tweaks and minor fixes
  Under the hood
  - We spent a LOT of time trying to make Beekeeper Studio more maintainable, backporting a lot of code from the ultimate version, and rewriting entire components to make them more modular. This has probably resulted in  a few bugs, but it helps us move faster in the future.
      - In particular, merge conflicts when merging community and master have been a real problem lately, these changes should help alleviate that.
  - We also migrated all of our database drivers to a typescript-based class model. While this also probably introduced a few bugs we haven't yet found, it allowed us to remove ~1000+ lines of generic code, and makes implementing a new database driver a lot quicker.
