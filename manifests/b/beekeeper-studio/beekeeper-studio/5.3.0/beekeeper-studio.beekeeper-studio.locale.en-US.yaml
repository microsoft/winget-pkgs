ReleaseNotes: |-
  The primary feature of this release is a new tab type -- the AI SQL Shell.
  Modeled after Claude Code and Aider, our AI integration requires zero fiddling, and can 'get to work' without a lot of hand holding. I've been using it myself for a month or so. It's good. Really good.

  Powerful, but transparent
  The AI shell is private. No data is sent to our servers, the shell connects directly to your agent using an API key that you provide.
  The Shell is smart and self-directed. You don't need to provide context, the AI will figure stuff out on its own. It can examine tables, run SQL (with your permission), and look at the results.
  The shell is transparent. It shows you everything it does, and asks your permission before running custom SQL code.
  The shell is optional. You can totally disable the AI shell if you don't want to see it, or just completely uninstall it. If you're an IT administrator you can disable (or enable) it for all your users.
  Just to be explicit about this: By using the AI shell you will be sending code (SQL) and data (query results) to your AI agent.
