ReleaseNotes: |-
  A new HC release — v0.23.3.0 — with a focus on stability, MSI Claw 8 support, and controller-connection improvements.
  What's Changed
  Improvements
  - Preliminary support for MSI Claw 8, including vibration, basic LED control, and battery-charge-limit settings (still a WIP).
  - Manufacturer-app toggle on the Device page to quickly enable or disable OEM utilities (MSI Center, Legion Space, Ally Space) for smoother migration.
  - Notification system rewrite, moving actions such as the Core isolation toggle into the Device page for a clearer UX.
  - Controller Manager overhaul (Experimental) — higher success rate for claiming XInput slot 1 and seamless Bluetooth power-cycling.
  - Suspend on Sleep (Experimental) — automatically pauses and resumes profiled apps when the device sleeps or wakes (hotkey coming soon).
  Bugfixes
  - Fixed numerous community-reported crashes and stability issues throughout the application.
  - Fixed cases where the virtual controller failed to take XInput slot 1.
  - Fixed Bluetooth controllers that previously required manual power-cycling after disconnecting.
  - Fixed unexpected behaviors when OEM utilities and HC were run simultaneously.
  - Various minor UI and wording fixes.
