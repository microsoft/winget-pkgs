ReleaseNotes: |-
  Releasing 0.22.2.8
  This update brings significant improvements, including faster AutoTDP responsiveness, an enhanced Layout Manager with new input translation features, smarter gyroscope calibration, and optimized performance across Legion Go, Rog Ally, and MSI Claw devices. We've also addressed several bugs to ensure smoother stability and reduced CPU usage. Thanks for your continued support.
  What's Changed
  Heterogeneous CPU support
  We've implemented a new power profile settings, CPU parking mode, which provides better granular control over CPU scheduling behavior on hybrid architectures: P/E cores (Intel Alder Lake, Raptor Lake, etc.) with following scenarios:
  - Gaming or performance-intensive apps: OnlyPCore or AllCoresPrefPCore
  - Battery-optimized or background apps: OnlyECore or AllCoresPrefECore
  - Balanced/default usage: Default case
  Axis to XYZ and New UI
  We're introducing a revamped Layout Manager UI, providing a cleaner interface, lower resource usage, and powerful new controller mapping functionalities. The updated Layout Manager is allowing you to seamlessly translate Axis and Trigger inputs into Button presses, Mouse clicks and movements as well as Keyboard actions. This initial release includes configurable direction and threshold settings, giving you greater control and customization options. Stay tunedâ€”more advanced configuration possibilities will arrive in future updates!
  Device support
  - Legion Go
    - Improved power profile and fan profile logic
    - Improved readiness check, slightly reducing loading time
    - Fixed crash when foreground application is in exclusive fullscreen
    - Fixed hang when setting fan control to software
    - Fixed issue where HC would hang when closed during initialization
    - Fixed crash when detachable controllers not connected during init
  - Rog Ally / Rog Ally X
    - Improved CPU and memory management when resuming from sleep
    - Fixed excessive CPU usage
  - MSI Claw
    - Improved CPU and memory management when resuming from sleep
  Improvements
  - AutoTDP v1.1: faster reaction time and smarter TDP adjustments (thank you Ravenger for the suggestions)
  - Updated Layout Manager UI:
    - Cleaner interface and lower resource usage
    - Translate Axis and Trigger inputs to Button/Mouse/Keyboard actions
    - Configurable direction and threshold settings
  - Smarter controller gyroscope calibration using SensorFusion and Stillness
  - Layout page shows buttons/axis based on profile controller, not current
  - Controller Management is faster and more resilient (disabled by default)
  - GPU Manager: more robust display detection and hooking
  - Improved driver failsafe logic: restores known controller drivers if missing
  - Heterogeneous CPU support for hybrid architectures:
    - OnlyPCore, AllCoresPrefPCore, OnlyECore, AllCoresPrefECore
  - Updated Portuguese Brazilian translation (thanks danmaxis)
  - Improved overall UI and performance experience
  Bugfixes
  - Fixed touchscreen support issues
  - Fixed issue hooking last plugged external controller
  - Fixed crash with ADLX v1.0 or below
  - Fixed overlay command not restoring user-defined values
  - Fixed main window always maximizing on close
  - Fixed crash when LibreHardwareMonitor fails to update
  - Fixed crash when Controller Manager has no target controller
  - Fixed issue preventing OEM keys/buttons from displaying on Layout page
  - Fixed crash when foreground window is exclusive fullscreen
  - Fixed crash on display settings events
  - Fixed crash when refreshing process list
  Known Issues
  - Slow and random memory leak can occur during long gaming sessions
  - On Lenovo Legion Go, setting fan control to "software" freezes UI
