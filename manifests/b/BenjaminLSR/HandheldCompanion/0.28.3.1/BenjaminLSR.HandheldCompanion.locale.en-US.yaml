  Handheld Companion – Release Notes
  0.28.3.1
  Highlights
  - Voltage control (AMD & Intel): Implemented proper voltage control for both AMD and Intel devices.
  - AMD: Works on all 4000-series SKUs and below. From the 5000-series onward, voltage control only works on Ryzen 9 or HX SKUs.
  - Intel: Works as expected.
  - Layout Editor upgrades: More reliable toggles and new automation options. Toggle state is now shared and matches the real status, action bindings can be delayed, and shift actions now support triggers (by @pepordev).
  - Improved sleep behavior: Added Enhanced sleep to optimize modern sleep power policies, plus Go back to sleep to automatically send the device back to sleep when it wakes for reasons other than the power button (ported from SuspendedNTime by @BassemMohsen).
  - Improved FSE support: HC main window and quick tools window will now properly be recognized and manipulated by FSE task manager.
  Device & Controller Support
  SuiPlay
  - 0X1: Implemented device support for SuiPlay 0X1 (MYSTEN LABS, INC.).
  GPD
  - Win 5: Updated device max TDP to 85W and fixed gyrometer support.
  - Win Mini (8840U, HX370 models): Fixed gyrometer support.
  - Win Max (HX370): Fixed gyrometer support.
  - AYANEO (all devices): Improved LED control (by @GopherTheCoder).

  - UI: Ask before deleting hotkeys (confirmation prompt).
  Layout Editor
  - New layout action: Absolute mouse position.
  - Added new action modifier key: LWin.
  - Added support for shift combinations (by @pepordev).
  Power & Process Handling

  - Fixed: An edge case where profile's actions could end up with Turbo and Toggle enabled simultaneously.
  - Fixed: Layout editor input duration slider not displayed.

  - Fixed: A rare crash when editing a layout.
  - Fixed: Charge bypass logic for AYANEO Legacy and Modern device families.

  - Fixed: An issue where the plugged controller wouldn't behave properly after a power cycling.
  - Fixed: A rare crash on HotkeyViewModel where Hotkey command buttonflags would be null.
  - Fixed: Creating a profile for explorer.exe will no longer try and get an artwork and proper name for it.
