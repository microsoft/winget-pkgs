  Handheld Companion â€“ Release Notes
  0.25.0.0 - Sleep, Hibernate and Resume
  0.25.0.0 release once again focuses on improving the overall user experience, bringing some love to the freshly released MSI Claw 7, 8 and younger sister the MSI Claw 1. We've also fixed a few remaining crashes and addressed one of the biggest issue we had: sleep, hibernate and resume.
  Sleep, Hibernate and Resume
  As you may know, Handheld Companion (HC) relies on Nefarius's ViGEmBus library to emulate an Xbox or Dualshock 4 controller. This virtual controller is essential for HC to manage input mapping and gyro-aiming. ViGEmBus is crippled by an issue causing BSOD when the device goes to sleep with a virtual controller emulated. Therefore, HC will unmount the virtual controller when going to sleep and mount it back when resuming which was causing another set of issues, ranging from: incapacity to mount, error in XInput slot assignation or simply stalled/muted virtual controller. We're happy to announce all of those were fixed with this new build, thanks to @Ryochan7 efforts.## PipsPager
  It ain't much but for those of you who have many applications and profiles on HC, the Quick start section from Quicktools application page could easily look cluttered. We've added a PipsPager element to group those profiles in pages of 8 elements maximum.
  Improving MSI Claw(s) support
  Thanks to our community and @_antheas from the Handheld Daemon project, we've implemented support over the latest MSI controller firmware. We've also slightly improved the rumble experience on MSI Claw 1 which is known for having a "not so great" out of the box rumble feedback.
  - MSI Claw 1: supported controller firmware: 0x163, 0x166.
  - MSI Claw 7/8: supported controller firmware: 0x211, 0x217.
  Miscellaneous Improvements
  - Improved process detection and profile application when resuming from sleep or hibernation.
  - Improved device opening logic, reducing unnecessary library loading and ensuring a better initialisation order for subroutines.
  - Improved update manager and implementation of an automatic check every 10 minutes that triggers an external and internal notification when an update is available.
  Bugfixes
  - Fixed incorrect margins within Quicktools.
  - Fixed an issue causing a random crash when monitoring Steam platform.
  - Fixed an issue causing a crash when plugging a Nintendo Switch Pro controller.
  - Fixed an issue causing controller manager to run into an endless loop.
  - Fixed an issue causing a crash when trying to access a controller's closed HID device.
  - Fixed an issue causing a crash when opening Quicktools before a foreground process was discovered.
  - Fixed an issue causing CPU usage spikes on MSI Claw when DInput controller wouldn't properly initialize.
  Library update
  - Nefarius.Drivers.hidHide updated to 3.0.0.
  - LibreHardwareMonitorLib updated to 0.9.5-pre419.
