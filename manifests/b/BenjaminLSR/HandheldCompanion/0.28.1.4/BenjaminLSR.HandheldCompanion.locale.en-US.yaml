  Handheld Companion – Release Notes
  0.28.1.4 - Wake & Play
  With this release, a lot of efforts went into reducing our CPU footprint and ensuring faster resume when system wakes up. We’ve also begun replacing WinRing0 with PawnIO (safer; fewer AV false positives) although this is only partial implementation for now, as power manipulation still uses WinRing0. On popular request, settings will now live in %LocalApplicationData%. During first launch, a backup is automatically written in %MyDocuments%.
  Device Support
  - Lenovo Legion Go 2 — full device support (known issue: left controller gyro Z axis is reverted, we encourage you in using right controller for gyro, under the device page settings).
  - AYANEO Flip DS 1S — full device support (including bottom screen brightness control).
  - MSI Claw - 10F BIOS partial support (we strongly discourage anyone to deploy this BIOS as it causes issues with the top right OEM button).
  - Added AMD CPU support for Strix Point, Dragon Range, Fire Range, HX370 (Pro), Krackan Point.
  System Usage Reduction
  - Reduced CPU usage in DInputController.
  - Lower CPU cost in HidLibrary I/O.
  - Reduced ThreadPool pressure in RaiseInputsUpdatedAsync.
  - Lowered CPU usage in RadioMonitor.
  - Lighter CPU path via LibreHardwareMonitor class adjustments.
  - SDL controllers now use Tick() instead of input pumping (helps CPU).
  - Updated WPF PresentationCore for stability/perf.
  New & Updated
  - Layout Mapping: Trigger to Button options.
  - SDL: updated to SDL3 3.2.24.
  - fr-FR translation refresh by @moi952.
  Navigation & UI
  - Gamepad UI navigation now supports HyperlinkButton.
  - Bottom bar buttons: click behavior fixed and consistent.
  - ProfilesPage shows saved Windows settings next to live values.
  - Improved screen friendly-name detection.
  Stability & Resume
  - Reduced resume delays from sleep/hibernation.
  - More stable virtual controller on resume.
  - New setting: Unhide controller on disconnect.
  - Improved controller unhide when app closes.
  Fixes
  - Rendering — UI could fail after toggling GPU acceleration.
  - Rendering (resume) — UI not drawing after sleep/hibernation.
  - Controllers — Infinite rumble after power-cycle while rumbling.
  - Controllers (SDL) — Trigger mapping to LB/LBSoft/RB/RBFull (DualShock/DualSense/…).
  - Preferred device — Better selection when plugging/unplugging.
  - Hotkeys — Default hotkeys deploy if none found; keyboard-triggered hotkeys with SDL.
  - MSI Claw (DInput) — Crash while controller was cycling.
  - AsusACPI — Resume stability.
  - CPU telemetry — Power/temperature readings corrected (requires PawnIO).
  - Favorites — Sub-profile management reliability.
  - Main Window — Visibility in Task View when minimized.
  - About page — Device illustration.
  - IGDB — Artwork download flow.
  - QuickTools (AYANEO Flip) — Touch keyboard height.
  - Misc crashes and exceptions hardened.
