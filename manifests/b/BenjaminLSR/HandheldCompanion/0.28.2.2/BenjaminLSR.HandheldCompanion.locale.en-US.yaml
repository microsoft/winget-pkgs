  Handheld Companion – Release Notes
  0.28.2.2
  Highlights
  - .NET 10 & Windows 11 focus: Handheld Companion now runs on .NET 10 and, starting from this branch, targets the Windows 11 SDK only (Windows 10 is no longer supported).
  - AMD Curve Optimiser: Implemented AMD CPU Curve Optimiser that lets you under- or over-volt compatible AMD devices to reduce energy consumption
  Device & Controller Support
  - GPD Win 5: New (WIP) device support.
  - ROG XBOX Ally: Added dedicated device support for both non-X and X versions.
  - MSI Claw: Better day-one experience with automatic msiapcfg deployment for the front OEM buttons, plus a fix for the 150% max fan speed issue.
  - AYANEO (all devices): Added built-in AYANEO power profiles (Extreme / Balanced / Saving) that ship directly with HC and can be applied from the app.
  - AYANEO Flip 1S: Fixed gyroscope readings.
  - Steam Controller: Fixed IsReady / IsConnected checks.
  - Steam Deck: Corrected GPU telemetry reading.
  - AOKZOE / OneXPlayer (all devices): Fixed OEM button support and crashes on initialisation.
  UI & Experience
  Library & profiles
  - You can now mark profiles as favorites from the Library page.
  - Library artwork sizing was tuned for a cleaner grid, and empty executable paths are no longer allowed when saving profiles.
  QuickTools & power controls
  - Added a Power dropdown to QuickTools (Lock, Sleep, Shutdown, Restart).
  - Battery overlay widget logic and display improved; it no longer depends on LibreHardwareMonitor.
  Commands & navigation
  - New Task View command and an improved Task Manager command.
  - Added Copilot Voice commands; they can also resize the Copilot window.
  Toasts & splash
  - Toasts can now include clickable actions for richer notifications.
  - Splash screen is no longer forced AlwaysOnTop, so it won’t get in your way during startup.
  Power & Process Handling
  Telemetry & CPU usage
  - Addressed excessive CPU usage in the LibreHardware ADLX integration.
  - Fixed a CPU leak when HidDevice is torn off.
    Process manager hardening: The process manager now treats critical shell processes as Restricted, reducing the chance for Windows UX to interfere with our profile logic. This includes:
  - Taskbar and ShellHost
  - ForegroundStaging and XamlExplorerHostIslandWindow
  - ApplicationManager_DesktopShellWindow
  Library updates
  - Updated several core libraries, including SDL 3.3.2, HidHide, Sentry, LibreHardwareMonitor, WindowsAPICodePack, Nefarius.ViGEm.Client, and more, plus added detection/support for Moonlight virtual controllers.
  Stability & Fixes
  - Fixed a crash caused by a race condition in VirtualManager during resume from sleep.
  - Fixed rare crashes linked to null controllers, null keyboard arguments, and null processEx.
  - Hardened joystick-to-button / keyboard / mouse-click mappings (axis threshold logic).
  - Fixed Legion Go touchpad handling (first part of a larger rework).
  - Fixed missing UseOpenLib declarations that caused crashes on GPD Win devices.
  - Fixed Steam Deck GPU readings and various controller stability issues.
