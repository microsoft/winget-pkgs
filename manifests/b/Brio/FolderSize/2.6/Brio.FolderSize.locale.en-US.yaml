ShortDescription: Show sizes of folders seen in Explorer windows
Description: Folder Size for Windows opens pop-up windows that track open Explorer windows. The new window shows not only the size of files, but also the size of folders. It keeps track of which folders you view, and scans them in the background so you can see complete size of all files within the folder. It's very useful for cleaning up your disk. Once you get used to having that information available, a directory listing simply looks incomplete without it!
