ReleaseNotes: |-
  Bluefish 2.2.17 is a maintenance release that has only code cleanup fixes to comply better with modern compiler standards. It furthermore has fixes for a 64bit Windows build of Bluefish with Msys2. So there finally is an up to date Bluefish installer for windows again!
  The windows build has a few remaining issues that need to be solved. The biggest issue is that starting external commands from within Bluefish does not yet work (such as a preview in browser, an external filter or just your favourite CI/CD pipeline). The other big issues is the character map plugin that is not yet included in the installer. If you want to help to improve Bluefish on windows, contact me at olivier(at)bluefish.openoffice.nl or join the community mailinglist.
