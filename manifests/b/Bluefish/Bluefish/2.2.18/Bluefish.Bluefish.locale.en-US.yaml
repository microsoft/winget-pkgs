ReleaseNotes: Bluefish 2.2.18 has much better CSS language support. The color editor now also supports hsl() and rgb() style colors. This Bluefish release also shows colors by just hovering the mouse over a color code. This version does also support the feature to dynamically change a shortcut key by hovering the mouse over a menu item and pressing a new shortcut key again. This feature was present in all gtk2 applications and has not been working for bluefish gtk3 builds until now. For Windows users the build has some important fixes, most important it can start external commands again such as preview in browser. This release removes the infobrowser from the build since it no longer compiles with new libxml versions. This plugin was already deprecated and disabled by default for years.
