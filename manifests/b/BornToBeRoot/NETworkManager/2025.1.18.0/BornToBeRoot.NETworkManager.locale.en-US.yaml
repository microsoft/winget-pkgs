ShortDescription: A powerful tool for managing networks and troubleshoot network problems!
Description: Connect to remote systems and manage your network and server infrastructure using tools like Remote Desktop (RDP), PuTTY (SSH, Telnet, Serial), PowerShell (WinRM), TigerVNC (VNC), or AWS Console (AWS SSM). Analyze, troubleshoot, and obtain detailed information about your network and systems with features such as the WiFi Analyzer, IP Scanner, Port Scanner, Ping Monitor, Traceroute, DNS Lookup, and LLDP/CDP Capture (and many more) â€” all within a unified interface.
