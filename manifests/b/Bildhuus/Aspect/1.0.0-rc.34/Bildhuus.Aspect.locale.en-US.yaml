ShortDescription: Aspect is a digital asset manager for photographers with peer-to-peer synchronization for cross-device support without the need for a cloud or subscriptions.
Description: |-
  Aspect is a digital asset manager that uses end-to-end encrypted peer-to-peer synchronization to offer full cross-device support, without requiring cloud storage or subscriptions of any kind. Photos are stored and organized transparently in the file system, so that they can be accessed seamlessly by other applications.

  It introduces novel organization concepts in the form of collections that offer hierarchies, local context, metadata automation, taxonomies, automated exports and more. Together, these offer a much more powerful tool set for organization workflows than the classical approaches with just ratings, flags, color labels, keywords and albums.

  There is a strong emphasis on privacy and ownership. None of your data leaves your device, standard formats are used wherever possible to ensure compatibility with other applications, and no subscription scheme forces you to pay for just being able to continue to use the software. The basic version is completely free, while Aspect Pro is a one-time payment with an additional year of free upgrades included.
