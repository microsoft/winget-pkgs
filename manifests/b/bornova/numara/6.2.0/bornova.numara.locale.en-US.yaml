  - Enhanced error handling in the editor by displaying error messages for problematic lines on line numbers. (#176) Thanks @colinricardo!
    - Line errors are now indicated on the line numbers by default instead of showing 'Error' message as answer to reduce clutter caused by error messages while typing. This can be re-enabled in settings (previous default).
