ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Introduce option to allow locale specific thousands and decimal separators in typed expressions. To enable, go to Settings > Locale and toggle on Enable for input. With this setting enabled (turned off by default), expressions such as 1,000.23 + 1,200 (or 1.000,23 + 1.200 depending on the locale) are now evaluated. (Ref. #185) Please note, this is still somewhat experimental and probably has room for improvement so please feel free to report any bugs/issues. Also, with this enabled, semicolon needs to be used as argument separator in functions such as sum(1;2).
  - Hovering over settings item labels now show a tooltip with a short description of the setting.
  - Minor fixes and improvements
  - Updated dependencies
