ReleaseNotes: |-
  UI Changes
  - Replaced custom window control buttons with native controls.
  - Added a new option to display answers directly below expressions. (Ref #86)
    This can be configured in Settings, alongside existing options to display answers either left-aligned with a divider or right-aligned without one.
  - Introduced an option to start the calculator with a blank page. (Ref #155)
    - If a blank page already exists on startup, it will be shown.
    - If not, a new blank page will be created.
    - Disabled by default. By default, the app reopens to the last active page.
  - Simplified customization of the Plain theme (used when syntax highlighting is off) via the Theme Customizer in Settings.
  - Moved the Print button from the side panel to the main panel for easier access.
  - Main dialogs (e.g., Settings, New Page) are now draggable. Double-clicking the title resets their position to the center of the screen.
  - Reorganized Settings menus for better usability.
  - Replaced the “Plot” text link with an icon for a cleaner interface.
  - Currencies can now be entered using lowercase letters (e.g., usd is treated the same as USD). (Ref #98)
  - Implemented various subtle UI tweaks and visual improvements.
  Under-the-Hood Improvements
  - Switched to cached DOM elements to boost performance.
  - Refactored most of the code for better performance and maintainability.
  Breaking Changes
  - User locale settings no longer apply to input expressions—only to answers. Commas (,) are now the only accepted separator for function variables. This change improves consistency and simplifies syntax. (Ref #112)
    - The default locale is now set to “System.”
  - Commas are automatically stripped from pasted answers by default. This can be disabled in Settings. (Ref #119)
  Note
  An app reset (from Settings > Reset App link) is recommended to make sure all new features are loaded properly. Make sure to back up all calculations and settings.
