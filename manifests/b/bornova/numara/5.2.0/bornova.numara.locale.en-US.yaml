ReleaseNotes: |-
  - BREAKING CHANGE: The way Formulajs is loaded into Numara has been changed due to conflict in function names, such as N (as reported in #69). Formulajs methods now need to be prefixed with xls..
  Old: SUM(1,2,3) // 6
  New: xls.SUM(1,2,3) // 6
  - Improved autocomplete hints.
  - Reload window after saving user defined functions and units.  This immediately refreshes user functions and units rather than waiting for app restart.
  - Updated dependencies.
