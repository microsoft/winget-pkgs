  Pedantic Lints
  Lints can now be labelled as pedantic, meaning they usually won't run. These lints can be very trivial changes, or lints that may generate false positives, and developers won't want to see them on every execution. Run hemtt check --pedantic to see these lints, or change them to enabled by default in your project.toml or lints.toml files.
