  New Lints
  PabstMirror's SQF Inspector is here! ðŸŽ‰ It adds a number of new lints, some of which require running hemtt check --pedantic. Check out the SQF Lints page for more information on all of HEMTT's lints and how to configure them!
  Global Configuration
  HEMTT now has a global configuration file, right now used for some hemtt launch functionality! See the Global Configuration and hemtt launch pages for more information!
  Binarize Cache (An Experimental Feature)
  HEMTT is testing a cache for binarization! It is disabled by default, but can be tested with the --exp-bin-cache flag.
  When doing local builds, binarized files will be reused between builds, reducing build times. hemtt release will always do a full binarization.
  During testing, you will need to run --exp-bin-cache on every build to see benefits. Please report any issues (or lack thereof) on the HEMTT channel in the ACE Discord.
