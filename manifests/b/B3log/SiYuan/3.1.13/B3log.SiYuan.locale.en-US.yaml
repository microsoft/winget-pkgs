  Overview
  This version supports setting dynamic icons for documents and improves data synchronization.
  From this version, SiYuan will automatically clean up the local data repository after the first data sync ends after startup:
  - Only 2 snapshots are kept per day
  - Snapshots older than 180 days are cleaned up
  You can adjust this cleanup policy in Settings - About - Data repo purge.
  Automatic snapshot cleanup helps improve startup speed. If you do not want a snapshot to be cleaned up, you can manually tag the snapshot, and the tagged snapshot will not be cleaned up.
