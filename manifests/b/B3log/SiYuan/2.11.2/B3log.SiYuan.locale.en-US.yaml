ReleaseNotes: |-
  Overview

  In this version, we have solved the problem of some operations hanging when inserting large assets, OCR, and data sync, and improved the stability of the kernel program.
  Additionally, we fixed an issue that caused data corruption in the cloud after resetting the local data repo but not resetting the cloud directory before synchronizing the data.
  - If you are using the official cloud data sync, the cloud data will be automatically verified during the first sync after startup. If the cloud data is found to be corrupted, you will be prompted. At this time, please reset the local data repo and cloud directory
  - If you are using S3/WebDAV data sync, automatic cloud data verification cannot be performed. To be on the safe side, it is recommended to manually reset the local data repo and cloud directory
