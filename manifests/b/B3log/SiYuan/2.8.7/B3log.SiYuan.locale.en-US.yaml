  Overview

  This version improves a lot of details, such as no longer jumping after folding the heading, no longer refreshing the interface after data synchronization, reducing the interference with the current working state.
  Otherwise, this version also improves the stability of writing files. If you often encounter File system access error, then the upgrade should be able to improve it.

  Spaced repetition
  Supports converting the spaced repetition UI to a tab, so that you can view or operate the content of other tabs during the spaced repetition process to improve efficiency.

  Plugin system
  This version initially implements the plugin system so that community developers can start early access. The plugin system is planned to be officially released in v2.9.0.

  File system
  Because of some reasons (such as antivirus software), occupying files will cause data to be unable to be written to files, which will cause the kernel to exit and prompt the user.
  In this version, we have improved the file writing, and now we will retry after the write fails. If the retry fails, the kernel will exit, which can improve stability to a certain extent.

  Data synchronization
  The main improvement is that the interface is no longer reloaded after data synchronization, but only the changed part is refreshed, which can reduce the interface flicker and improve the user experience.

  Community marketplace
  Community marketplace has added some configuration items for various types of extension packages:
  - Funding: Support configuration of Open Collective, Patreon, GitHub and custom funding links
  - Icon: Support configuration of package icon
  - I18n: Support configuration of multiple languages
  We recommend that marketplace developers update the relevant config items to get better display effects in the marketplace. For details, please refer to the following examples:
  - SiYuan theme sample
  - SiYuan icon sample
  - SiYuan template sample
  - SiYuan widget sample
  - SiYuan plugin sample
