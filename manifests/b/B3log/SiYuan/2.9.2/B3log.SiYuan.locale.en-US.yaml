ReleaseNotes: |-
  Overview

  This version improves the data synchronization function and solves the problem of repeated generation of conflict files on some systems.
  Things to note when upgrading this version:
  - After the upgrade, the cloud data index will be automatically rebuilt when starting for the first time. If the amount of data is large, the process will be time-consuming. It is recommended to restart when the network is good
  - After upgrading this version, the cloud data is not compatible with the previous version. All devices need to be upgraded to this version before they can be used normally. Mixed versions will cause the cloud data indexes to overwrite each other, which is likely to cause cloud data damage
