ShortDescription: A vault for securely storing and accessing AWS credentials in development environments
Description: |-
  AWS Vault is a tool to securely store and access AWS credentials in a development environment.

  AWS Vault stores IAM credentials in your operating system's secure keystore and then generates
  temporary credentials from those to expose to your shell and applications. It's designed to be
  complementary to the AWS CLI tools, and is aware of your profiles and configuration in
  ~/.aws/config.
