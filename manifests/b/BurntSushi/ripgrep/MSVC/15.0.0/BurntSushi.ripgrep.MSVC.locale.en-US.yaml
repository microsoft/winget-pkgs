  ripgrep 15 is a new major version release of ripgrep that mostly has bug fixes,
  some minor performance improvements and minor new features.

  In case you haven't heard of it before, ripgrep is a line-oriented search
  tool that recursively searches the current directory for a regex pattern.
  By default, ripgrep will respect gitignore rules and automatically skip
  hidden files/directories and binary files.

  Here are some highlights:

  Several bugs around gitignore matching have been fixed. This includes
  a commonly reported bug related to applying gitignore rules from parent
  directories.
  A memory usage regression when handling very large gitignore files has been
  fixed.
  rg -vf file, where file is empty, now matches everything.
  The -r/--replace flag now works with --json.
  A subset of Jujutsu (jj) repositories are now treated as if they were git
  repositories. That is, ripgrep will respect jj's gitignores.
  Globs can now use nested curly braces.
  Platform support:

  aarch64 for Windows now has release artifacts.
  powerpc64 no longer has release artifacts generated for it. The CI
  release workflow stopped working, and I didn't deem it worth my time to
  debug it. If someone wants this and can test it, I'd be happy to add it
  back.
  ripgrep binaries are now compiled with full LTO enabled. You may notice
  small performance improvements from this and a modest decrease in binary
  size.
  Performance improvements:

  PERF #2111:
  Don't resolve helper binaries on Windows when -z/--search-zip isn't used.
  PERF #2865:
  Avoid using path canonicalization on Windows when emitting hyperlinks.
  PERF #3184:
  Improve performance of large values with -A/--after-context.
