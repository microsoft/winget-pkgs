ShortDescription: >
  ripgrep recursively searches directories for a regex pattern while respecting
  your gitignore
Description: |-
  ripgrep is a line-oriented search tool that recursively searches the current
  directory for a regex pattern. By default, ripgrep will respect gitignore rules
  and automatically skip hidden files/directories and binary files. (To disable
  all automatic filtering by default, use rg -uuu.) ripgrep has first class
  support on Windows, macOS and Linux, with binary downloads available for every
  release. ripgrep is similar to other popular search tools like The Silver
  Searcher, ack and grep.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Sponsorship is appreciated!

  This is a small release that fixes a bug with how ripgrep handles line
  buffering. This might manifest as ripgrep printing output later than you
  expect or not working correctly with tail -f (even if you're using the
  --line-buffered flag).
