ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Any time field can be specified (and if you've configured a pool key other than ts, it will start out using that)
  - count() by typeof(this) now populates the stacked bars by default, but you can change this to use any other field
  - If a pool is created from an imported pcap, ts and _path are used by default as before
  - You can also now toggle the chart off/on and resize it
  Other Changes
  - Update Zed to v1.9.0
  - Update Brimcap to v1.5.1
  - The stacked bar chart is now generalized for any time-based data (not just Zeek-like with _path & ts fields) (#2785, #2794, #2805)
  - The stacked bar chart is now resizable and can be toggled off/on (#2806, #2810)
  - A single Zui window now shows tabs only for the currently selected Zed lake connection (#2797)
  - Fix an issue where attempting to save a Zed query that contained a parse error caused a stack dump (#2803)
  - Fix an issue where a table of results was sometimes rendered with blank rows (#2813)
  - Fix an issue where comments at the end of a Zed program caused the queries that populate the stacked bar chart to fail (#2822)
