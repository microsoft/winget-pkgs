  ✨ Scroll & Layout Stabilization
  - Index-Based Scroll Tracking: Replaced pixel-based scroll positions with index-based tracking, enabling perfect scroll synchronization even when switching between Grid and List views with different item heights.
  - 🛡️ Anti-Flicker Technology: Implemented "Strategic Hiding" during layout transitions. The file list remains invisible for a few milliseconds until it has correctly calculated its column count and target scroll position, eliminating jarring layout shifts.
  - ⚡ Sub-Pixel Precision: Added a mathematical tolerance (+50% height center) to scroll detection, preventing the scroll position from "creeping" upward due to browser sub-pixel rounding errors.
  - Race Condition Guard: Fixed a critical bug where the grid would jump exponentially downwards on mount by preventing scroll restoration until the container width is fully measured.
  - Smooth Tab Restoration: Refined the tab-switching logic to ensure that restored scroll positions are rock-solid and never interrupted by automatic selection scroll.
