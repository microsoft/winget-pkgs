  🚀 Quick Explorer v0.1.14
  Changelog - February 15, 2026
  ⚡ v12.0 "Out-of-Band Decoupling" & Performance
  - Asynchronous File Operations: Implemented a dedicated STA (Single-Threaded Apartment) worker thread. Commands now return immediately, preventing UI freezes during long-running operations.
  - Event-Driven UI Refresh: High-performance "refresh-on-completion" using Tauri events (refresh-tab), ensuring the UI stays in sync without blocking the user.
  - IFileOperation Modernization: Full migration to the modern Windows API for all core file operations (Copy, Move, Rename, Delete, New Folder).
  🛡️ Stability & Modality Improvements
  - Input Synchronization: Integrated AttachThreadInput to properly transfer focus from the STA worker to the main window.
  - Smart Window Disabling: Refined the run_modal mechanism to disable the app window ONLY when a system dialog is active, preventing accidental interactions.
  🛠️ Internal Optimizations
  - Type Safety & Reliability: Fixed OLE imports and type ambiguities in the Rust backend.
  - STA Worker Health: Improved thread management and error handling for background tasks.
