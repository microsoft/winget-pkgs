ReleaseNotes: |-
  A Brand New BrowserOS!
  We've been heads down building, and we're SO excited to share this with you — this is a complete revamp of BrowserOS! 🎉
  ✨ What's new:
  - New Agent — Meet the completely rebuilt agent! Faster, smarter, and way more reliable.
  - Agent Per Tab — You can now spin up an agent in each tab. Run multiple agents doing different things, all at the same time.
  - Polished UI — We've given the entire interface a fresh coat of paint. It's cleaner, more refined, and just feels better.
  - Manifest V2 Support — this means you can install ad blockers like uBlock Origin again!
  - Native Split View — Work on two things side by side with a simple shortcut.
  - Chromium 142 — We're now running on the latest Chromium (142.0.7444.49).
  - Azure & AWS Bedrock — Added native support for Azure OpenAI and AWS Bedrock models.
  ⚠️ Breaking Changes:
  - Old agent will stop working — please update to the new browserOS version asap.
  - LLM provider settings won't carry over — You'll need to reconfigure your API keys and model settings. Sorry about that!
