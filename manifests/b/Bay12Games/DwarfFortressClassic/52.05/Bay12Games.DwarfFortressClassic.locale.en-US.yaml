ShortDescription: A world building fantasy game, controlling a dwarven outpost or an adventurer in a randomly generated, persistent world.
Description: |-
  Dwarf Fortress is a single-player fantasy game. You can control a dwarven outpost or an adventurer in a randomly generated, persistent world.

  Although Dwarf Fortress is still in a work in progress, many features have already been implemented.
  - The world is randomly generated with distinct civilizations spanning centuries of detailed history, hundreds of towns, caves and regions with various wildlife.
  - The world persists as long as you like, over many games, recording historical events and tracking changes.
  - Command your dwarves as they search for wealth in the mountain.
  - Play an adventurer and explore, quest for glory or seek vengeance.
  - The combat model includes skills, body parts, individual tissues, material properties, aimed attacks, wrestling, one-time opportunities, charging and dodging between squares, bleeding, pain, nausea, various poison effects and much more. Attacks and other movements extend over several instants, allowing you to deliberately catch enemy blows or plan your counter-attack. In adventure mode, control each party member tactically or let them act on their own.
  - Generated poetry, musical forms, instruments and dances. Watch the dwarves perform, or try it yourself!
  - Hundreds of animals and other monsters, including many that are randomly generated for each world.
  - Multi-tile climbable trees and many, many kinds of plants. Fruit, flowers and falling leaves.
  - A dynamic weather model tracks wind, humidity and air masses to create fronts, clouds, rain storms and blizzards.
  - Over two hundred rock and mineral types are incorporated into the world, placed in their proper geological environments.
  - Add new creatures, weapons, plants, metals and other objects via modifiable text files.
  - Extended ASCII character set rendered in 16 colors (including black) as well as 8 background colors (including black).
