  Improvements
  - BCN-18547: Presentation names were previously overly truncated in the Player Library view making them difficult to read. While presentation names are still truncated, more characters are displayed making the names easier to identify.
  Fixes
  - BCN-18522: Fixed an issue with VideoMode where validation failures with 5K frame rates would cause a crash.
  - BCN-18496: Improved the performance of the Presentation Library and reduced the API load.
