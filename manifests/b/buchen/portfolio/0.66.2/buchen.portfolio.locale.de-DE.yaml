  - Improvement: Icon images under Windows now have improved transparency (no white background).
  - Improvement: The tooltip in the chart legend shows the ISIN, WKN, and ticker symbol of the security.
  - Improvement: Accounts with transactions can no longer be deleted. Transactions are required for calculations.
  - Improvement: In the "Payments" overview, transactions now also include the closing transaction of a trade.
  - PDF Importer Improvement: Trade Republic, OLB, Baader Bank, Comdirect.
  - Fix: Resolves a rounding issue in calculating the average of investments or earnings.
