ShortDescription: View disk space usage and delete unwanted data, fast.
Description: dua (-> Disk Usage Analyzer) is a tool to conveniently learn about the usage of disk space of a given directory. It's parallel by default and will max out your SSD, providing relevant information as fast as possible. Optionally delete superfluous data, and do so more quickly than rm.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  'q' to quit is now more usable as it will insta-quit if the traversal took less than 10s and
  if nothing is still marked for deletion.
  This makes it easy to use in 'quick-view' scenarios.
  Bug Fixes
  - instantly quit when no items marked for deletion
