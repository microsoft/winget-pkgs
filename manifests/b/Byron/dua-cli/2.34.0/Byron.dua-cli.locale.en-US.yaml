ShortDescription: View disk space usage and delete unwanted data, fast.
Description: dua (-> Disk Usage Analyzer) is a tool to conveniently learn about the usage of disk space of a given directory. It's parallel by default and will max out your SSD, providing relevant information as fast as possible. Optionally delete superfluous data, and do so more quickly than rm.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  This upcoming release improves day-to-day usability with a new configuration file.
  For users, the main additions are:
  - A persistent configuration file for dua with keyboard settings under [keys].
  - A new dua config edit command to open the configuration in $EDITOR.
  - Automatic creation of the configuration directory/file with sensible defaults when editing for the first time.
  Configuration defaults and behavior in this release:
  - keys.esc_navigates_back now defaults to true. This is a change from previous versions where it was false implicitly.
  You are welcome to contribute more settings as you see fit.

    Note that this changes the log format from
    04:41:37 [INFO]
