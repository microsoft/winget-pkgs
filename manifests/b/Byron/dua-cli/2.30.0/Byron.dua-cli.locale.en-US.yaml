ShortDescription: View disk space usage and delete unwanted data, fast.
Description: dua (-> Disk Usage Analyzer) is a tool to conveniently learn about the usage of disk space of a given directory. It's parallel by default and will max out your SSD, providing relevant information as fast as possible. Optionally delete superfluous data, and do so more quickly than rm.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  New Features
  - allow sorting by name in interactive mode
  Bug Fixes
  - formatting in src/interactive/app/handlers.rs
  - on MacOS use only 3 threads by default.
  Otherwise, it would get very slow and the difference is enormous.
  16 threads for example take 4.1s on a workload, whereas this only takes
  550ms with 3 threads.
  Style
  - simplify some statements for readability
