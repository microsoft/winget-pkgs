ShortDescription: Clean Your System and Free Disk Space
Description: When your computer is getting full, BleachBit quickly frees disk space. When your information is only your business, BleachBit guards your privacy. With BleachBit you can free cache, delete cookies, clear Internet history, shred temporary files, delete logs, and discard junk you didn't know was there. Designed for Linux and Windows systems, it wipes clean thousands of applications including Firefox, Adobe Flash, Google Chrome, Opera, and more. Beyond simply deleting files, BleachBit includes advanced features such as shredding files to prevent recovery, wiping free disk space to hide traces of files deleted by other applications, and vacuuming Firefox to make it faster. Better than free, BleachBit is open source.

  Known issues
  When installing on Windows, users may see the error "Code execution cannot proceed because msvcr100.dll was not found." This happens during the font cache initialization, and the installer will show that fc-cache.exe is running. If you have this msvcr100.dll error, install Visual Studio 2010 (VC++ 10.0) redistributable SP1 x86. Even on 64-bit systems, the x64 version will have no effect, so please use the x86 version. If this does not help, please file a bug ticket in GitHub to get one-on-one support. Alternatively, you may downgrade to BleachBit 4.4.2 (final) or upgrade to BleachBit 4.6.1 (pre-beta).
