ReleaseNotes: |-
  New

  Mark as Unread shows an empty blue circle instead of a “1” so you know there’s no new messages

  Fixed & Improved

  Audio should no longer mysteriously be muted

  Truncated links don’t point to the wrong location

  All Signal chats should now allow voice messages

  Tweaked how chats move between Inbox, Low Priority, and Archive to be more intuitive
