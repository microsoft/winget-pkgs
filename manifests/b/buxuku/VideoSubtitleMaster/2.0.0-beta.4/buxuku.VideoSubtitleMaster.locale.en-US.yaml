  Video Subtitle Master is a powerful desktop application for batch generating subtitles for videos and translating them into other languages. This project is an enhanced version of the open-source VideoSubtitleGenerator, redesigned as a user-friendly client tool.
  This application retains all the features of the original VideoSubtitleGenerator command-line tool, with the following enhancements:
  - Graphical user interface for easier operation
  - Source and target language subtitle files are saved in the same directory as the video for convenient subtitle attachment during playback
  - Batch processing of video/audio/subtitle files
  - Support for generating subtitles from video or audio files
  - Ability to translate generated or imported subtitles
  - Multiple translation services supported:
    - Volcano Engine Translation
    - Baidu Translation
    - DeepLX Translation (Note: Batch translation may be rate-limited)
    - Local Ollama model translation
    - Support for OpenAI-style API translations (e.g., deepseek, azure)
  - Customizable subtitle file naming for compatibility with various media players
  - Flexible translated subtitle content: choose between pure translation or original + translated subtitles
  - Integrated whisper.cpp with optimization for Apple Silicon, offering faster generation speeds
  - Built-in fluent-ffmpeg, eliminating the need for separate ffmpeg installation
  - Support for running locally installed whisper command
