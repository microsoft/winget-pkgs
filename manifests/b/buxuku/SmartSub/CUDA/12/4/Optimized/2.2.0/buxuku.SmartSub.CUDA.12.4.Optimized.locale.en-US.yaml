  - Ability to translate generated or imported subtitles
  - Multiple translation services supported:
    - Volcano Engine Translation

    - DeepLX Translation (Note: Batch translation may be rate-limited)
    - Local Ollama model translation
    - Support for OpenAI-style API translations (e.g., deepseek, azure)
  - Customizable subtitle file naming for compatibility with various media players
  - Flexible translated subtitle content: choose between pure translation or original + translated subtitles
  - Integrated whisper.cpp with optimization for Apple Silicon, offering faster generation speeds
  - Built-in fluent-ffmpeg, eliminating the need for separate ffmpeg installation
  - Support for running locally installed whisper command
