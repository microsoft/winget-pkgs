ReleaseNotes: |-
  Added
  - Dynamic memories are now supported with the pooling instance allocator which can possibly reduce the number of page faults throughout execution at the cost of slower to run code. Page faults are primarily reduced by avoiding releasing memory back to the system, relying on bounds checks to keep the memory inaccessible. #5208
  - The wiggle generator now supports function-level control over tracing calls. #5194
  - Support has been added to wiggle to be compatible with shared memories. #5225 #5229 #5264 #5268 #5054
  - The wiggle generator now supports a "trappable error" configuration to improve error conversions to guest errors and ensure that no host errors are forgotten or accidentally become traps. The wasi-common crate has been updated to use this. #5276 #5279
  - The memory.atomic.{notify,wait32,wait64} instructions are now all implemented in Wasmtime. #5255 #5311
  - A wasm_config_parallel_compilation_set configuration function has been added to the C API. #5298
  - The wasmtime CLI can have its input module piped into it from stdin now. #5342
  - WasmBacktrace::{capture,force_capture} methods have been added to programmatically capture a backtrace outside of a trapping context. #5341

  Changed
  - The S type parameter on Func::typed and Instance::get_typed_func has been removed and no longer needs to be specified. #5275
  - The SharedMemory::data method now returns &[UnsafeCell<u8>] instead of the prior raw slice return. #5240
  - Creation of a WasiCtx will no longer unconditionally acquire randomness from the OS, instead using the rand::thread_rng() function in Rust which is only periodically reseeded with randomness from the OS. #5244
  - Codegen of dynamically-bounds-checked wasm memory accesses has been improved. #5190
  - Wasmtime will now emit inline stack probes in generated functions for x86_64, aarch64, and riscv64 architectures. This guarantees a process abort if an engine was misconfigured to give wasm too much stack instead of optionally allowing wasm to skip the guard page. #5350 #5353

  Fixed
  - Dropping a Module will now release kernel resources in-use by the pooling allocator when enabled instead of waiting for a new instance to be re-instantiated into prior slots. #5321
