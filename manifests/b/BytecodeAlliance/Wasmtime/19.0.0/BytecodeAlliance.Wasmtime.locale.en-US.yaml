ReleaseNotes: |-
  Added
  - C API bindings for the sampling-based profiler in Wasmtime have been added. #7854
  - Add the WasiP1Ctx to ease the use of wasmtime-wasi in place of wasi-common #8053
  - The Winch compiler backend is now feature-complete for x64. Note that minor issues and fuzz bugs are still being addressed, but now's a good time to test if you're interested. #7894 #7909 #7927 #7932 #7949 #7974 #8001
  - The typed function references proposal to WebAssembly is now fully implemented. #7943
  - The component::Linker type is now "semver aware" in that it enables loading components referring to past or future versions of interfaces so long as the types are compatible. #7994
  - Wasmtime can now be built for "custom platforms" which is intended for bare-metal builds. #7995
  - The wasmtime-wasi-nn crate now has a backend based on WinML. #7807
  - The wasmtime CLI now has flags for configuring limits of the pooling allocator. #8027
  Changed
  - The wasmtime serve command no longer binds its port with SO_REUSEADDR meaning that if it is invoked twice only one will succeed. #7863
  - The sampling-based profiler in Wasmtime now takes an explicit argument of the time delta between samples. #7873
  - Many accessors for type information now require an &Engine argument to be specified in preparation for an implementation of wasm GC. #7892
  - The host header is now forbidden in wasi-http. #7905
  - Stronger type-checks are now performed for host-owned resources when interacting with the component model to help catch mistakes earlier. #7902
  - Demangling Rust and C/C++ symbols in WebAssembly modules is now done by default in the C API. #7962
  - Preview2-based APIs are now located at the root of the wasmtime_wasi crate instead of a submodule. #7933
  - Components now reserve index 0 for handle tables to match the component model specification. #7661
  - Support for externref has been moved behind a new gc Cargo feature. This will also gate support for wasm gc in the future. #7975
  - Require the WASMTIME_WASI_CONFIG_PREOPEN_SOCKET_ALLOW environment variable to bet set to allow the use of wasi_config_preopen_socket via the c api, as it will be deprecated in 20.0.0. #8053
  Fixed
  - WIT interface names that are Rust keywords now correctly generate bindings. #7790
  - PKRU state is now restored across await points. #7789
  - Wasmtime now correctly supports global.get in all constant expressions within a module. #7996
