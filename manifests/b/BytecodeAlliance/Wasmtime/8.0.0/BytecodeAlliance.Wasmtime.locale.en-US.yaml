ReleaseNotes: |-
  Added
  - Allow the MPL-2.0 and OpenSSL licenses in dependencies of wasmtime. #6136
  - Add a bounds-checking optimization for dynamic memories and guard pages. #6031
  - Add support for generating perf maps for simple perf profiling. Additionally, the --jitdump and --vtune flags have been replaced with a single --profile flags that accepts perfmap, jitdump, and vtune arguments. #6030
  - Validate faulting addresses are valid to fault on. As a mitigation to CVEs like GHSA-ff4p-7xrq-q5r8, check that the address involved in a fault is one that could be contained in a Store, or print a scary message and abort immediately. #6028
  - Add the --default-values-unknown-imports option to define unknown function imports as functions that return the default value for their result type. #6010
  - Add Clone for component::InstancePre. #5996
  - Add --dynamic-memory-reserved-for-growth cli flag. #5980
  - Introduce the wasmtime-explorer crate for investigating the compilation of wasm modules. This functionality is also exposed via the wasmtime explore command. #5975
  - Added support for the Relaxed SIMD proposal. #5892
  - Cranelift gained many new machine-independent optimizations. #5909 #6032 #6033 #6034 #6037 #6052 #6053 #6072 #6095 #6130

  Changed
  - Derive Copy on wasmtime::ValType. #6138
  - Make StoreContextMut accessible in the epoch deadline callback. #6075
  - Take SIGFPE signals for divide traps on x86_64. #6026
  - Use more specialized AVX instructions in the x86_64 backend. #5924 #5930 #5931 #5982 #5986 #5999 #6023 #6025 #6060 #6086 #6092
  - Generate more cache-friendly code for traps. #6011

  Fixed
  - Fixed suboptimal code generation in the aarch64 backend. #5976 #5977 #5987 #5997 #6078
  - Fixed suboptimal code generation in the riscv64 backend. #5854 #5857 #5919 #5951 #5964 #6087
