ReleaseNotes: |-
  Added
  - Add yielding support in wasmtime_store_epoch_deadline_callback in the C API. #7476
  - Support for the wasi_unstable module ("wasi preview0" canonically) has been added to the -Spreview2 support in the CLI. #7548
  - The original module can now be obtained from an "instance pre" in the C API. #7572
  - Usage of Mach ports on macOS can now be disabled in the C API. #7595
  Changed
  - The preview1-to-preview2 component adapters now import a smaller number of interfaces by default. #7543 #7544
  - Wasmtime and Cranelift now require Rust 1.72.0 to build. #7554
  - The default world supported by wasmtime serve has been slimmed down to exactly what wasi:http/proxy specifies by default. Support for other WASI APIs can be included with the -S common command-line flag. #7597
  - The wasmtime --version CLI output will now include date/commit information when Wasmtime is built from a git checkout. #7610
  Fixed
  - MPK support is now explicitly disabled on AMD-based CPUs since the implementation does not currently support it. #7513
  - Initialization of a WebAssembly data segment with a negative offset is fixed to zero-extend the offset instead of sign-extend. #7559
  - The reported offset of O_APPEND files in preview1 has been fixed. #7586
  - MPK support does a better job of compacting memories to minimize virtual memory used. #7622
  Cranelift
  - Union node bitpacking has been fixed with egraph optimizations to ensure the minimal cost node is selected. #7465
  - Equivalent-cost expressions now have ties broken with expression depth in egraphs to prefer "shallow" expression trees. #7456
  - Long-and-narrow chains of expressions are now optimized into shallow-and-wide trees. #7466
