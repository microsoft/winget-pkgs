ReleaseNotes: |-
  Added
  - The wasmtime-c-api-impl crate is now published on crates.io. #7837
  - A new EngineWeak type enables holding a weak pointer to an engine with the ability to dynamically and fallibly upgrade it to an Engine. #7797
  - The WebAssembly tail calls proposal can now be enabled through the C API. #7811
  - The import and export types of a Component can now be inspected at runtime. #7804
  - New APIs/types have been added to support a faster version of looking up module exports without using string lookups with Module::get_export_index. #7828
  Changed
  - Owned resources represented with ResourceAny can now be passed as arguments to functions that require a borrow<T> parameter. #7783
  - Generated structures from wasmtime::component::bindgen! for exported interfaces are now all renamed to Guest to avoid conflicting with WIT names. #7794
  - Guest profiler output will now automatically demangle symbols. #7809
  - The wasmtime crate now has a runtime Cargo feature which, if disabled, enables building Wasmtime with only the ability to compile WebAssembly modules. This enables compiling Wasmtime's compilation infrastructure, for example, to WebAssembly itself. #7766
  - Support for the old wasi-common crate and the original implementation of "WASIp1" aka "preview1" is being deprecated in the wasmtime-wasi crate. Users should migrate to the wasmtime_wasi::preview2 implementation, which supports both WASIp1 and WASIp2, as in the next release the wasi-common-based reexports of wasmtime-wasi will be deleted. #7881
