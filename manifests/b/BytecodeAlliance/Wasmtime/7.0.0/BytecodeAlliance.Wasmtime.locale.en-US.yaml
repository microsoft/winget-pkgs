  Added
  - An initial implementation of the wasi-threads proposal has been implemented and landed in the Wasmtime CLI. This is available behind a --wasi-modules experimental-wasi-threads flag. #5484
  - Support for WASI sockets has been added to the C API. #5624
  - Support for limiting Store-based resource usage, such as memory, tables, etc, has been added to the C API. #5761
  - A top level alias of anyhow::Result as wasmtime::Result has been added to avoid the need to explicitly depend on anyhow. #5853
  - Initial support for the WebAssembly core dump format has been added to the CLI with a --coredump-on-trap flag. #5868

  Changed
  - The S type parameter on component-related methods has been removed. #5722
  - Selection of a world to bindgen has been updated to select any default world in a WIT package if there is only one. #5779
  - WASI preopened file descriptors can now be closed. #5828
  - The host traits generated by the bindgen! macro are now always named Host, but are still scoped to each individual module. #5890

  Fixed
  - Components which have type imports are now supported better and error/panic in fewer cases. #5777
  - Types referred to by wasmtime::component::Val are now reexported under wasmtime::component. #5790
  - A panic due to a race between memory.atomic.{wait32,wait64,notify} instructions has been fixed. #5871
