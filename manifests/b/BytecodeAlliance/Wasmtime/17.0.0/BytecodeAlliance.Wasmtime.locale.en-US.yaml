ReleaseNotes: |-
  The major feature of this release is that the WASI support in Wasmtime is now considered stable and flagged at an 0.2.0 version approved by the WASI subgroup. The release was delayed a few days to hold off until the WASI subgroup voted to approve the CLI and HTTP worlds and they're now on-by-default! Additionally the component model is now enabled by default in Wasmtime, for example an opt-in flag is no longer required on the CLI. Note that embeddings still must opt-in to using the component model by using the wasmtime::component module.

  Added
  - Cranelift optimizations have been added for "3-way comparisons", or Ord::cmp in Rust or <=> in C++. #7636 #7702
  - Components now use Wasmtime's compilation cache used for core wasm modules by default. #7649
  - The Resource<T> and ResourceAny types can now be converted between each other. #7649 #7712

  Changed
  - Minor changes have been made to a number of WITs as they progressed to their official 0.2.0 status. #7625 #7640 #7690 #7781 #7817
  - The component model is now enabled by default. #7821
  - The implementation of memory.atomic.{wait,notify} has been rewritten. #7629
  - The wasmtime_wasi::preview2::Table type has been moved to wasmtime::component::ResourceTable. #7655
  - Creating a UDP stream now validates the address being sent to. #7648
  - Defining resource types in Linker<T> now takes the type to define as a runtime parameter. #7680
  - Socket address checks can now be performed dynamically at runtime. #7662
  - Wasmtime and Cranelift's MSRV is now 1.73.0. #7739

  Fixed
  - Bindings for WIT APIs where interfaces have multiple versions are now fixed by putting the version in the generated binding names. #7656
  - The preview1 fd_{read,write} APIs are now fixed when a shared memory is used. #7755
  - The preview1 fd_{read,write} APIs no longer leak an intermediate stream created. #7819
