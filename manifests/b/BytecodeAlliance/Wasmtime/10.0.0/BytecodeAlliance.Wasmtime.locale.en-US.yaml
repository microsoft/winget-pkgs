ReleaseNotes: |-
  Added
  - Expose the Config::static_memory_forced option through the C api #6413
  - Basic guest-profiler documentation for the book #6394
  - Merge the initial wasi-preview2 implementation #6391
  - The wasi-preview2 component adapter has been pulled into the main wasmtime repository. It is available for the first time as part of this release, but should be treated as as a beta at this time. Patch releases will not be made for bug fixes. #6374
  - A callback invoked when an epoch deadline is reached can now be configured via the C API. #6359
  - PR auto-assignment policies have been documented, to clarify the expectations of reviewers. #6346
  - Support for the function references has been added #5288
  Changed
  - An epoch_deadline_callback now returns an UpdateDeadline enum to allow optionally yielding to the async executor after the callback runs. #6464
  - The --profile-guest flag has now been folded into --profile=guest #6352
  - Initializers are no longer tracked in the type information for globals, and instead are provided when creating the global. #6349
  - The "raw" representation of funcref and externref in the embedding API has been updated from a usize to a *mut u8 to be compatible with Rust's proposed strict provenance rules. This change is additionally reflected into the C API as well. #6338
  Fixed
  - Fixed a soundness issue with the component model and async #6509
  - Opening directories with WASI on Windows with NONBLOCK in flags has been fixed. #6348
  Cranelift changes
  - Performance improvements in regalloc2 have landed, and compilation time has improved #6483 #6398
  - Renamed abi::Caller to abi::CallSite #6414
  - Work has begun on SIMD support for the riscv64 backend #6324 #6366 #6367 #6392 #6397 #6403 #6408 #6419 #6430 #6507
