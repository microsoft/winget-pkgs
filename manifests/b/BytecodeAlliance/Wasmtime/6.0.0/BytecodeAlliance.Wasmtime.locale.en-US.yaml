ReleaseNotes: |-
  Added
  - Wasmtime's built-in cache can now be disabled after being enabled previously. #5542
  - Older x86_64 CPUs, without SSE4.1 for example, are now supported when the wasm SIMD proposal is disabled. #5567
  - The Wasmtime C API now has WASMTIME_VERSION_* macros defined in its header files. #5651
  - The wasmtime CLI executable as part of Wasmtime's precompiled release artifacts now has the all-arch feature enabled. #5657

  Changed
  - Equality of wasmtime::component::Val::Float{32,64} now considers NaNs as equal for assistance when fuzzing. #5535
  - WIT syntax supported by wasmtime::component::bindgen! has been updated in addition to the generated code being updated. #5565 #5692 #5694
  - Cranelift's egraph-based optimization framework is now enabled by default. #5587
  - The old PoolingAllocationStrategy type has been removed in favor of a more flexible configuration via a new option PoolingAllocationConfig::max_unused_warm_slots which is more flexible and subsumes the previous use cases for each strategy. #5661
  - Creation of InstancePre through Linker::instantiate_pre no longer requires a Store to be provided. Instead a Store-related argument is now required on Linker::define-style APIs instead. #5683

  Fixed
  - Compilation for FreeBSD on x86_64 and AArch64 has been fixed. #5606
