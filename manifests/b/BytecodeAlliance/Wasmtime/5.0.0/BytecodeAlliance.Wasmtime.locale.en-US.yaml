  Added
  - A wasmtime::component::bingen! macro has been added for generating bindings from *.wit files. Note that WIT is still heavily in development so this is more of a preview of what will be as opposed to a finished feature. #5317 #5397
  - The wasmtime settings CLI command now has a --json option for machine-readable output. #5411
  - Wiggle-generated bindings can now generate the trait for either &mut self or &self. #5428
  - The wiggle crate has more convenience APIs for working with guest data that resides in shared memory. #5471 #5475

  Changed
  - Cranelift's egraph support has been rewritten and updated. This functionality is still gated behind a flag and may become the default in the next release. #5382
  - The implementation of codegen for WebAssembly linear memory has changed significantly internally in Cranelift, moving more responsibility to the Wasmtime embedding rather than Cranelift itself. This should have no user-visible change, however. #5386
  - The Val::Float32 and Val::Float64 variants for components now store f32 and f64 instead of the bit representation. #5510

  Fixed
  - Handling of DWARF debugging information in components with multiple modules has been fixed to ensure the right info is used for each module. #5358
