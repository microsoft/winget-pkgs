ReleaseNotes: |-
  Added
  - Support for SIMD in the Pulley interpreter can now be disabled at compile-time to shrink the size of the final binary. #10727
  - The C API now has wasmtime_trap_new_code to create a wasm_trap_t from its code. #10765
  - Winch's support for x86_64 is now classified with tier 1 support in Wasmtime. #10755
  - Winch's support for aarch64 now implements stack checks to pass many more spec tests. #10763
  - Cranelift's s390x backend now has full support for the f128 type. #10774
  - Wasmtime's C API for the component model has initial support for calling functions. #10697 #10841 #10858 #10864 #10877
  - The wasmtime wast command now has a --generate-dwarf flag to show filename/line number information for backtraces. #10780
  Changed
  - The shape of bindgen!-generated add_to_linker functions has changed with the removal of GetHost and replacement of a HasData trait. For more information see the associated PR. #10770
  - Wasmtime's Store<T> now requires that T: 'static. This is done in preparation for merging WASIp3 work to the main repository with some more information on the associated PR. #10760
  - The wasmtime::component::Instance::instance_pre method is now public. #10761
  - Wasmtime and Cranelift's minimnum supported version of Rust (MSRV) is now 1.85.0. #10785
  - Cranelift's debugtrap on aarch64 now generates brk #0xf000 for debuggers to recognize it. #10813
  - The wasi-http implementation no longer generates a trap if the handle to receive the response on the host is dropped early. #10833
  - The wasmtime serve command will now send some boilerplate descriptive HTML on a 500 server error instead of nothing. #10851
  - A significant amount of work has gone into the new assembler for the x64 backend. Too many PRs to list here but progress continues apace at defining all machine instructions in a standalone crate.
  - Cranelift will now reject unimplemented big-endian loads/stores on backends that do not implement this functionality. #10863
  - The wasmtime explore generated HTML handles large modules better now. #10892
  - Wasmtime's internal representation of wasmtime::Func has changed and a previous optimization of Func::call has been lost. If affected it'd recommended to use Func::call_unchecked instead or to open an issue. #10897
