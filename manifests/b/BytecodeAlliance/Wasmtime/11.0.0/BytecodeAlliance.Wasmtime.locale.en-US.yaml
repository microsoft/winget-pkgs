ReleaseNotes: |-
  Changed
  - The WASI Preview 2 WasiCtxBuilder type has been refactored, and WasiCtx now has private fields. #6652
  - Component bindgen! now generates owned types by default instead of based on how they're used #6648
  - Wasmtime/Cranelift on x86-64 can now execute Wasm-SIMD on baseline SSE2, which all x86-64 processors support (as part of the base x86-64 spec). Previously, SSE4.2 extensions were required. This new work allows Wasm with SIMD extensions to execute on processors produced back to 2003. #6625

  Fixed
  - Only export the top-level preview2 module from wasmtime-wasi when the preview2 feature is enabled. #6615

  Cranelift changes
  - Tail call implementation has begun in Cranelift #6641 #6666 #6650 #6635 #6608 #6586
  - Work continues on SIMD support for the riscv64 backend #6657 #6643 #6601 #6609 #6602 #6598 #6599 #6587 #6568 #6515
  - Fix AuthenticatedRet when stack bytes are popped in the aarch64 backend #6634
  - The fcvt_low_from_sint instruction has been removed, as it its current behavior can be recovered through a combination of swiden_low and fcvt_from_sint #6565
