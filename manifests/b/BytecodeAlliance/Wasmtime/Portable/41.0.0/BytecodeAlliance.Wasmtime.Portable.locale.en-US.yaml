ShortDescription: A fast and secure runtime for WebAssembly
Description: Wasmtime is a Bytecode Alliance project that is a standalone wasm-only optimizing runtime for WebAssembly and WASI. It runs WebAssembly code outside of the Web, and can be used both as a command-line utility or as a library embedded in a larger application.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  41.0.0
  Released 2026-01-20.
  Added
  - Support for {Future,Stream}Any in the component model has improved.
    #12142
  - Wasmtime has initial support for breakpoints and single-stepping with the
    debug feature for guest programs.
    #12133
  - Wasmtime has begun adding a new Error type which is similar to
    anyhow::Error but supports gracefully handling OOM. Wasmtime still uses
    anyhow::Error but this will change in the future to wasmtime::Error which
    will be a distinct type.
    #12163
  - An initial top-level crate for async-debugging guest programs has been added.
    #12183
  Changed
  - Cranelift now optimizes redundant select + icmp instructions.
    #12135
  - Synchronous component model functions can no longer block before returning.
    This implements a change in the upstream specification to the upcoming async
    support in the component model which places stricter restrictions on
    non-async functions and their ability to perform blocking operations.
    #12043
  - Frame iteration in debug mode now visits all activations which enables
    seeing all frames from recursive wasm calls.
    #12176
  - Wasmtime now requires Rust 1.90.0 or later.
    #12167
  - Intra-component stream/future reads/writes are now allowed for simple data
    types.
    #12181
  - The POLL callback code has been removed from the canonical ABI for async
    functions and the waitable-set.poll function no longer yields.
    #12182
  - Guest-to-guest adapters injected by Wasmtime now have improved trapping error
    messages.
    #12215
  Fixed
  - #[derive(Lift)] for enums with exactly 256 cases has been fixed.
    #12140
  - With component-model-async support recursively calling a guest from a host
    function has now been fixed.
    #12152
