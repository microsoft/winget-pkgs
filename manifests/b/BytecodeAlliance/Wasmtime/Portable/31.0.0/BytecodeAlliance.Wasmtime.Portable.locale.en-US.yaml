ShortDescription: A fast and secure runtime for WebAssembly
Description: Wasmtime is a Bytecode Alliance project that is a standalone wasm-only optimizing runtime for WebAssembly and WASI. It runs WebAssembly code outside of the Web, and can be used both as a command-line utility or as a library embedded in a larger application.

    #10251
    #10265
    #10255
  Changed
  - Pulley's implementation of loads/stores to linear memory has changed to
    better support optimizations and reduction of interpreter opcodes in the
    final binary.
    #10154
  - Cranelift's verifier now ensures that integers used as address types have the
    correct width.
    #10209
  - Wasmtime and Cranelift's minimum supported version of Rust is now 1.83.0.
    #10264
  - Wasmtime now mentions the filename when the input cannot be opened on the CLI.
    #10292
  - All types are now generated in component::bindgen!, even if they're not
    reachable.
    #10311
  - Tables allocated with the system allocator now use alloc_zeroed (aka
    calloc) for allocation.
    #10313
  Fixed
  - GC: the is-null-or-i31ref checks have been fixed.
    #10221
  - GC: an incorrect assertion and canonicalized types for runtime usage has been
    fixed.
    #10223
  - GC: subtype checks for imported globals during instantiation have been fixed.
    #10304
  - GC: exposing references to wasm in the gc_alloc_raw libcall has been fixed.
    #10322
  - Winch's fuel checks correctly sync fuel before the check now.
    #10231
  - Winch's treatment of stores and other trapping ops has been fixed on AArch64.
    #10201
  - Winch's handling of the shadow stack pointer has been fixed on AArch64.
    #10263
  - Winch's handling of address calculations has been fixed on AArch64.
    #10297
  - Winch's handling of multivalue return of constants has ben fixed.
