ShortDescription: A fast and secure runtime for WebAssembly
Description: Wasmtime is a Bytecode Alliance project that is a standalone wasm-only optimizing runtime for WebAssembly and WASI. It runs WebAssembly code outside of the Web, and can be used both as a command-line utility or as a library embedded in a larger application.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  40.0.0
  Released 2025-12-20.
  Added
  - WASIp3 support for wasi:http now implements Response::from_http to convert
    from standard Rust types to WASI types.
    #12063
  - Cranelift now supports a "patchable" ABI which has a maximum number of
    arguments and clobbers no registers. This is paired as well with a new
    patchable_call instruction which supports being turned into NOPs at runtime.
    #12061
    #12101
  Changed
  - Support for the WebAssembly threads proposal is now classified as tier 2 by
    default. Additionally creation of SharedMemory is disabled by deafult behind
    a new config knob/CLI flag.
    #12036
  - A variety of peephole-style optimizations have been added to Cranelift's
    optimization passes.
    #11994
    #11995
    #11996
    #11997
    #11998
    #11999
    #12000
    #12006
    #12008
  - Component host functions have been slightly optimized to remove an Arc clone
    and reduce contention.
    #11987
  - Support for component-model-async has been updated to account for the
    changes specified in WebAssembly/component-model#578.
    This means that historical binaries using WASIp3, for example, are no longer
    valid. Recompilation of historical components will be required and
    source-level changes may also be required in some circumstances.
    #12031
    #12043
  - The UnsyncBoxBody type is now used everywhere in wasmtime-wasi-http instead
    of just in the wasip3 support.
    #12060
  - Initial groundwork for gracefully handling OOM (e.g. returning an error
    instead of aborting) has been added.
    #12070
    #12089
  - Wasmtime will create a private copy of code memory when guest debugging is
    enabled to assist with modifying code when adding/removing breakpoints.
    #12051
  - The ResourceTable type will no longer use Tombstone when compiled in debug
    mode.
    #12114
  - Intra-component future/stream reads/writes will now trap instead of
    accidentally being allowed.
    #12117
  - Cranelift optimization rules have been tweaked after it was discovered that
    they could pessimize code containing long chains of computations.
    #12116
  Fixed
  - Compilation of i8x16.popcnt has been fixed in Winch for some potential
    inputs.
    #12010
  - A panic in Instance::prepare_call for some component-model-async situations
    has been fixed.
    #12054
  - An off-by-one error for lifting/lowering enums/variants with 255 cases has
    been fixed.
    #12066
  - Restarting the read of a host future after cancellation has been fixed.
    #12093
  - Compilation for OpenBSD on x86_64 has been fixed.
    #12097
  - Components containing a module type which exoprts a tag are now supported.
    #12125
