ReleaseNotes: |-
  41.0.1
  Released 2026-01-26.
  Fixed
  - Fixed a bug in lowering of f64.copysign on x86-64 whereby when combined
    with an f64.load, the resulting machine code could read 16 bytes rather
    than 8 bytes. This could result in a segfault when Wasmtime is configured
    without signals-based traps.
