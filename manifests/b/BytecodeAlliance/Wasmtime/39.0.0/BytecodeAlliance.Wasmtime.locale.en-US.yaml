ReleaseNotes: |-
  Added
  - Initial work has begun to support WebAssembly-level debugging natively in Wasmtime. This is intended to complement today's preexisting DWARF-level debugging, but this work will be portable and operate at the WebAssembly level of abstraction rather than the machine-level. Note that this work is not yet complete at this time but is expected to get filled out over the coming releases. #11768 #11769 #11873 #11892 #11895
  - The pooling allocator now exposes more metrics about unused slots. #11789
  - The Wizer and component-init projects have been merged into Wasmtime under a new wasmtime wizer CLI subcommand and wasmtime-wizer crate. This is mostly a drop-in replacement for both with a minor caveat that the initialization function is now called wizer-initialize instead of wizer.initialize to be compatible with components. #11805 #11851 #11853 #11855 #11857 #11863 #11866 #11867 #11877 #11876 #11878 #11891 #11897 #11898
  - The Config::wasm_feature method is now public. #11812
  - Enabling the wasm exceptions proposal is now exposed in the C API. #11861
  - The wasmtime crate now has a custom-sync-primitives Cargo feature which enables using custom synchronization primitives defined by the embedder. This is useful in no_std targets where the default panic-on-contention primitives are not appropriate. #11836
  - Wasmtime now supports unsafe intrinsics to be used for compile-time builtins. This can be used to provide give low-level access to host APIs/memory to a guest program in a controlled fashion. #11825 #11918
  - The signals_based_traps configuration option is now exposed in the C API. #11879
  - A new EqRef::from_i31 function has been added. #11884
  - The wasmtime serve subcommand will, by default, now reuse instances when used with WASIp3 components. This increases throughput and additionally showcases the concurrent features of WASIp3. This can be opted-out-of on the CLI as well. #11807
  - The C++ API for components has been filled out and implemented. #11880 #11889 #11988
  - A new ResourceDynamic type, similar to Resource<T>, has been added to support host resources that have a dynamic tag at runtime rather than a statically known tag at compile time. This is then used to implement resources in the C/C++ API as well. #11885 #11920
  - The C/C++ API of Wasmtime now supports the custom-page-sizes wasm proposal. #11890
  - Initial support has been added for the cooperative multithreading component model proposal in Wasmtime, built on async primitives. #11751
  - The epoch_deadline_callback Rust API has been bound in C++. #11945
  - A new Request::into_http helper has been added to the WASIp3 implementation of wasi:http. #11843
  - A define_unknown_imports_as_traps function has been added to the C API. #11962
  - A callback-based implementation of stdout and stderr has been added to the C API for WASI configuration. #11965
  Changed
  - Running async functions in the component model now operates at the Store-level of abstraction rather than an Instance. #11796
  - The wasmtime serve subcommand no longer mistakenly spawns an epoch thread per-request and instead uses a single epoch thread. #11817
  - The component-model-async Cargo feature is now on-by-default. Note that it is still gated at runtime by default. Also note that Wasmtime 39 does not include #12031 which means that components using async produced with the latest wasm-tools will not run in Wasmtime 39. To run async components it's recommended to pin to a historical version of wasm-tools and guest toolchains for now. #11822
  - Bindings generated by wiggle no longer use async_trait. #11839
  - Wasmtime's documentation now has an example of a plugin system using Wasmtime. #11848
  - Profiling with perfmap or jitdump now uses O_APPEND to be more amenable to other engines in the same process also using perfmap/jitdump. #11865
  - The wasmtime-wasi-http crate now uses UnsyncBoxBody to clarify that Sync is not required. #11941
  - A . character is now used instead of / int he bindgen! macro to separate interface members. #11947
  - The func_new function for component linkers now provides the type to the callee so it knows the type that the component that imported it is using. #11944
  - The component::Func type now has a type accessor and the old params/result accessors were deleted. #11943
  - Wasmtime now requires Rust 1.89.0 or later to compile. #11959
  Fixed
  - Some panics handling shapes of components with resources in various locations has been fixed. #11798
  - Bitwise float operations in Cranelift have been fixed on aarch64. #11811
  - An off-by-one in the bounds check of wasm atomic operations has been fixed. #11977
  - Bounds-check elision now happens again with 4 GiB guard pages. #11973
