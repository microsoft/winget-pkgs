ReleaseNotes: |-
  Added
  - Support for shared WebAssembly memories has been added to the C API. #7940
  - A Component::component_type method has been added to reflect on the imports and exports of a component. #8078
  - The with key in bindgen! now supports remapping entire packages and namespaces. #8083
  - Winch now supports the component model by using Cranelift to generate trampolines. #8082 #8109
  - The WASI-NN backend now supports ONNX. #7691
  - The wasmtime CLI now has an -S inherit-env flag for inheriting the entire process environment. #8168
  - Winch now supports the WebAssembly memory64 proposal. #8194
  - Embedders can now opt-in to allowing wasmtime-wasi to block the current thread with file operations, for example. #8190
  - A wasmtime::CodeBuilder type has been added to refine the configuration of compiling a Module or a Component. #8181
  - The wasmtime serve subcommand now enables configuring preopened directories and environment variables. #8279
  Changed
  - Support for WebAssembly GC is in the process of being implemented which has required refactoring and reimplementing the existing gc support for externref. Many APIs in this area has changed, see linked PRs for more details. Note that the wasm_* parts of the C API no longer support externref. #8011 #8196
  - The wasmtime::component::Val type no longer stores type information and instead must be interpreted in the context of a type. #8062
  - The arguments required for ResourceAny::try_from_resource have been simplified by refactoring the internal representation. #8061
  - The arguments required for wasmtime::component::Linker::func_new have been simplified by refactoring the internal representation. #8070
  - The pooling allocator is now enabled by default with wasmtime serve. #8073
  - The error message for missing imports in has been improved with components. #7645
  - Wasmtime's MSRV is now 1.75.0. #8205
  - Wasmtime's translation of table-related instructions has improved codegen in some common cases, especially with call_indirect. #8063 #8125 #8124 #8134 #8137 #8162 #8159 #8172 #8171 #8139 #8206
  - Book-based documentation has been reordered and refactored. #8130
  - The -S common flag is renamed to -S cli, to better reflect that it provides the wasi-cli APIs. -S common is still accepted for now, and will be deprecated in the future. #8166
  - The tail-call calling convention now supports callee-saved registers to improve performance and allow enabling this WebAssembly proposal by default in the future. #8246
  - The wasmtime-wasi crate has been refactored to restructure some items and documentation has been added for most items. #8228
  - Support for the WebAssembly threads proposal is now gated by an on-by-default Cargo feature named threads. #8260
  - Borrow-checking in wiggle has been optimized to not be as fine-grained any more. This is a breaking change if users are relying on the ability to safely mutably borrow disjoint regions of memory. #8277
  Fixed
  - Connection timeouts with wasi-http have been fixed. #8085
  - Generating bindings with bindgen! now works correctly when some WIT types are not used. #8065
  - Errors in wasi-http are no longer accidentally returned as traps. #8272
