  What's Changed
  - Update README.md by @nebuk89 in #407
  - BREAKING fix: inconsistent path behavior for single artifact downloads by ID by @GrantBirki in #416
  v5.0.0
  🚨 Breaking Change
  This release fixes an inconsistency in path behavior for single artifact downloads by ID. If you're downloading single artifacts by ID, the output path may change.
  What Changed
  Previously, single artifact downloads behaved differently depending on how you specified the artifact:
  - By name: name: my-artifact → extracted to path/ (direct)
  - By ID: artifact-ids: 12345 → extracted to path/my-artifact/ (nested)
  Now both methods are consistent:
  - By name: name: my-artifact → extracted to path/ (unchanged)
  - By ID: artifact-ids: 12345 → extracted to path/ (fixed - now direct)
  Migration Guide
  ✅ No Action Needed If:
  - You download artifacts by name
  - You download multiple artifacts by ID
  - You already use merge-multiple: true as a workaround
  ⚠️ Action Required If:
  You download single artifacts by ID and your workflows expect the nested directory structure.
  Before v5 (nested structure):
  - uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
    with:
      artifact-ids: 12345
      path: dist
  # Files were in: dist/my-artifact/
  > Where my-artifact is the name of the artifact you previously uploaded
  To maintain old behavior (if needed):
  - uses: actions/download-artifact@v5
    with:
      artifact-ids: 12345
      path: dist/my-artifact  # Explicitly specify the nested path
