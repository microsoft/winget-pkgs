ReleaseNotes: |-
  This version contains a number of bugfixes as work continues on the foundations for future functionality.
  As always binary builds with installers, zips and tarballs are available on renderdoc.org.
  Python API changes
  - No breaking changes to the Python API.
  Features/Improvements
  - UI: Adjust shader debugger colours when using the dark theme.
  - D3D12: Match variable names to disassembly for resource access SSA names.
  - D3D12: Ensure SSA variables are displayed until the end of their use.
  - D3D12: Add support for variable length strings in PIX strings, as well as V2 PIX strings.
  - D3D12: Improve DXIL disassembly for global pointers.
  - Vulkan: Improve SPIR-V disassembly when basic block order is unconventional.
  - Vulkan: Add support for extensions:
    - VK_KHR_robustness2
    - VK_EXT_dynamic_rendering_unused_attachments
  Bugfixes
  - Windows: Fix problems caused by windows 11 hotpatch DLLs.
  - UI: Show an error if a working directory is specified but does not exist.
  - UI: Detect if an application with a reserved filename such as explorer.exe is launched and show an error.
  - UI: Fix interpreting pointers to basic non-structure types.
  - UI: Fix a crash that could happen when making edits to shader debug locations.
  - Vulkan: Fix handling of acceleration structures in push descriptors.
  - Vulkan: Fix incorrect callstack being generated for inlined function calls.
  - Vulkan: Fix reading from BDA pointers to basic types in push constants not correctly respecting declared array strides.
  - Vulkan: Fix reads and writes from storage texel buffers in shader debugging.
  - Vulkan: Fix display of texel buffers when VK_WHOLE_SIZE is specified as the size.
  - D3D: Fix a potential crash debugging shaders that use groupshared memory.
  - D3D: Fix a crash if a programmatic capture is triggered after presenting to and then deleting a swapchain.
  - D3D11: Handle unusual arrangement of mapping and unmapping buffers across frame boundaries.
  - D3D11: Fix state tracking for D3D11.1 offsetted constant buffer bindings.
  - D3D12: Fix reflection of 16-bit types in external shader interfaces.
  - D3D12: Fix pixel history over ExecuteIndirects that contain multiple draws.
  - D3D12: Fix internal command allocator not being reset leading to a leak or potentially a crash when shader debugging.
  - OpenGL: Fix separable patching in some cases where individual gl_PerVertex members are redeclared as individual globals.
  - OpenGL ES: Fix an error generated during context creation.
