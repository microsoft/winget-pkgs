ShortDescription: A very fast accurate code counter with complexity calculations and COCOMO estimates
Description: |-
  A tool similar to cloc, sloccount and tokei. For counting the lines of code, blank lines,
  comment lines, and physical lines of source code in many programming languages.

  Goal is to be the fastest code counter possible, but also perform COCOMO calculation like
  sloccount, estimate code complexity similar to cyclomatic complexity calculators and produce
  unique lines of code or DRYness metrics. In short one tool to rule them all.

  Also it has a very short name which is easy to type scc.

  If you don't like sloc cloc and code feel free to use the name Succinct Code Counter.
