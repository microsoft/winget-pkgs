ShortDescription: Secure, Fast & Private Web Browser with Adblocker.
Description: Secure, Fast & Private Web Browser with Adblocker. This is not the release version of Brave. Be careful - things are unstable and might even be broken. These builds are an unpolished and unfinished early previews for the new versions of Brave on the desktop. They show our work in progress and aren't for the faint-of-heart. Features may be missing or broken in new and exciting ways; familiar functionality may have unfamiliar side-effects. These builds showcase the newest advances that we're bringing to your browser, but this is still a prototype, not a reliable daily driver. Try it out only if you're looking for a little extra spice and adventure in your browsing.
