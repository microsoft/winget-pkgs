Description: |-
  Balsamiq Wireframes is a rapid low-fidelity UI wireframing tool that reproduces the experience of sketching on a notepad or whiteboard, but using a computer.
  It really forces you to focus on structure and content, avoiding lengthy discussions about colors and details that should come later in the process.
  Wireframes is FAST: you will generate more ideas, so you can throw out the bad ones and discover the best solutions.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Hello, friends of Balsamiq!
  We just did a major, no, ICONIC Balsamiq Wireframes release. ;)

  - Windows and Mac: MAJOR UPDATE! We updated the icon set to Font Awesome 6 (both the Regular and Solid sets).
    You now have over 6,308 icons to choose from, and they're all nicely categorized! That's almost 10x as many as before!
  - Windows and Mac: To make room for all the new icons, icon library is now bigger by default, and resizeable.
  - Windows and Mac: We now use the new icons inside our controls as well, instead of our old home-grown ones. It's more consistent and clean!
  - Windows and Mac: The default size for icons now is small (because it's more common than the previous large size).
  - Windows and Mac: We added the icon pop-up to the search field in the find text dialog.
  - Windows and Mac: We fixed an error when an icon inside text didn't fit within a control.
  - Windows and Mac: We renamed "Skins" to "Style", and renamed the Wireframe skin to "Clean".
  - Windows and Mac: WE REMOVED ONE OF THE RIGHT-SIDE PANELS! You can now change a project's style, font, colors and description from the Project menu instead.
  - Windows and Mac: We made internal and external links throughout the app have a consistent look.
  - Windows and Mac: Clicking on a link in the wireframe notes will no longer trigger an edit even in addition to following the link.
  - Windows and Mac: We fixed an issue with the hierarchy not working properly on mobile devices.
  - Windows and Mac: The sticky note control now supports the {mockup-name} tag.
  - Windows and Mac: We fixed an issue with the color tag values getting clipped in some cases.
  - Windows and Mac: We improved the usability of image links
  - Windows: We fixed an issue when adding images from the windows photos application.
  - Windows: The icon library now always loads the icons in the size that the current select control has.
  - Windows: Using the size slider in the icon library will go to the correct size in one go.
