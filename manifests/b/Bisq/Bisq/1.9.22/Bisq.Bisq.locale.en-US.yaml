ReleaseNotes: |-
  This is a hotfix release that applies the upstream BitcoinJ fix for the chainwork bug. The bug caused Bisq to stall at block height 928,895 because the field used to store the accumulated proof of work was too small. Henrik Jannsen, who is the release manager for Bisq 2, will now also be added as a release manager for Bisq 1.
  If you experience any wallet-related issues, you may perform an SPV resync, although this should not be necessary.
  Installation
  macOS
  Bisq does not use Apple's notarization process (see why).
  For that reason you will see that (misleading) alert:
  Grant permissions by:
  - run sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Bisq.app in a terminal (type Terminal in the Apple search box)
  - open Bisq again
  More details can be found here.
  Windows
  For similar reasons you will get that warning at Windows: Windows protected your PC
  - Click the More info button when prompted
  - Click the Run anyway button when prompted
  More details can be found here.
