ReleaseNotes: |-
  This is a hotfix release that applies the upstream BitcoinJ fix for the chainwork bug. The bug caused Bisq to stall at block height 928,895 because the field used to store the accumulated proof of work was too small. Henrik Jannsen, who is the release manager for Bisq 2, will now also be added as a release manager for Bisq 1.
  If you experience any wallet-related issues, you may perform an SPV resync, although this should not be necessary.
