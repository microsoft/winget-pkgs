Because of the signing and notarization process that requires the developer certificate used for the build on macOS it is not possible to create the same jar on macOS.API\nStarting with v1.9.0 you can use pre-built versions of the Bisq cli (bisq-cli-v1.9.16.zip) and Bisq daemon (bisq-daemon-v1.9.16.zip) to use Bisq without touching the user interface.Just download the archives and extract them locally. You have to run the daemon to access the local Bisq daemon API endpoints.To run daemon.jar on Mainnet:\n\n$ java -jar daemon.jar --apiPassword=becareful\n\nIf you just want to control your headless daemon within your terminal you have to run the Bisq cli as well.Again just download the bisq-cli archive and extract it locally.To call getversion from cli.jar\n\n$ java -jar cli.jar --password=becareful getversion\n\nYou can use the Bisq API to access local Bisq daemon API endpoints, which provide a subset of the Bisq Desktop application's feature set: check balances, transfer BTC and BSQ, create payment accounts, view offers, create and take offers, and execute trades.The Bisq API is based on the gRPC framework, and any supported gRPC language binding can be used to call Bisq API endpoints.You'll find in-depth documentation and examples under following link: https://bisq-network.github.io/slate/#introductionBisq gRPC API reference documentation example source code is hosted on GitHub at  Java and Python developers interested in bot development may find this Intellij project useful for running the existing examples, and writing their own bots.For additional developer support please join Development - Bisq v1 on Matrix.Known issues with installation\nmacOS:\nWe removed notarization from our build pipeline because of of the risk of Apple certification revocation (see  Unfortunately this will require extra steps when installing Bisq on macOS.Please follow the guide at https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491 in the section If you want to open an app that hasn’t been notarized or is from an unidentified developerIf you are running already macOS Ventura (13.0+) you need to do following to be able to start Bisq:enter following command in Apple Terminal sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Bisq.app\nhit enter and you will be prompted to enter your password to be able to execute the command as super user\nAfter running this successfully you should be able to start Bisq as always.Windows:\nWe removed the developer code signing because of the same reason as with Apple.\nFor Windows you just have to ignore the warning after you have verified the installation file yourself and proceed with the installation.There is a known issue with Anti Virus software. We got several reports from users running into different problems. Either the AV software blocks Bisq or Tor, delete files in the data directory [2] or app directory [1]) or cause such a long delay at startup that Tor gets terminated and a file remains locked which can cause that Bisq cannot be started afterwards. To resolve that you need to restart Windows then the lock get released. We are working on solutions to fix those issues.If you use Crypto currencies on your Windows system be aware that Windows is much more vulnerable to malware than Linux or OSX. Consider to use a dedicated non-Windows system when dealing with cryptocurrencies.[1] Application directory (contains application installation files):\nC:\\Users<username>\\AppData\\Local\\Bisq[2] Data directory (contains all Bisq data including wallet):\nC:\\Users<username>\\AppData\\Roaming\\Bisq\\btc_mainnet\\tor (you can delete everything except the hiddenservice directory)Linux:\nHint for Debian users:\nIf you have problems starting Bisq on Debian use: /opt/bisq/bin/BisqIf your Linux distro does not support .deb files please follow this instruction:\n\ncd ~/Downloads  \nmkdir tmp  \ncd tmp   \nar x ../Bisq-64bit-1.9.16.deb  \nsudo tar Jxvf data.tar.xz  \nsudo cp -rp opt/Bisq /opt/\n\nThat instruction is not tested on many different distros. If you encounter problems please report it in a Github issue so we can improve it.Credits\nThanks to everyone who directly contributed to this release:- @alejandrogarcia83\n- @alvasw\n- @devinbileck\n- @Emzy\n- @gabernard\n- @HenrikJannsen\n- @jmacxx\n- @stejbac\n- @wiz\nA special thanks to our first time contributor:- @runbtc\nAs well as to everyone that helped with translations on Transifex."
