ShortDescription: UI for Pinecil V2 - control it over BLE from your PC or your mobile.
Description: |-
  Why focus on soldering when you can play with the settings instead?
  With this app you have full control over your new shiny Pinecil V2
  from your computer using bluetooth.

  **NB:** No special browser flags or BLE GATT required;
    works on all major OS and phones.

  **NB:** This app needs the backend to start on a computer terminal;
    then the user interface runs from any browser.
    It CANNOT run entirely by only opening a browser like Joric's UI.
