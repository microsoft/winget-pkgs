ShortDescription: A complete, cross-platform solution to record, convert and stream audio and video.

  FFmpeg is the leading multimedia framework, able to decode, encode, transcode, mux, demux, stream, filter and play pretty much anything that humans and machines have created. It supports the most obscure ancient formats up to the cutting edge.
  A static FFmpeg build from BtbN based on the master branch with all dependencies, even those that require full GPL instead of just LGPL.
