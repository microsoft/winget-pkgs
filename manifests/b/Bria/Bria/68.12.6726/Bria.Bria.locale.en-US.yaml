ReleaseNotes: |-
  Volume for Audio Output
  We have recently changed how Bria Windows controls the volume for audio output. When you change the volume within Bria Windows, it now directly changes the device audio volume at the system level. This aligns with how similar UC apps control the volume.
  We are aware that Bria 6.7.3 has an issue related to this change where when the user mutes Bria Windows, it mutes the whole computer, not just Bria Windows. We are working on solving this issue.
  Resolved issues
  - Fixed issues with LDAP search.
  - Fixed issues with Broadsoft XSI Directory and History.
  If you continue to encounter a resolved issue, or if you have a new issue, please report it to the CounterPath Support Center.
  Known issues
  Video rendering issue
  When you resize a video window, you might experience issues with incoming video, such as displaying incorrectly or corrupted. It has been observed on laptops that have both Intel HD Graphics 520 and Nvidia GeForce 940MX, and we are working on resolving the issue. In the meantime, go to Preferences > Devices > Other Devices and change Video Render Mode to DirectX 9.
  Video call issues
  If the remote party tries to add video to an audio call on your Team Voice account, the call is dropped. If the caller tries to add video to an audio call, the call remains as an audio call. In order to use video, place the call as a video call.
