ShortDescription: |-
  Ready-to-use SRT / WebRTC / RTSP / RTMP / LL-HLS media server and media proxy that allows to read,
  publish, proxy, record and playback video and audio streams.
Description: |-
  MediaMTX is a ready-to-use and zero-dependency real-time media server and media proxy that allows
  to publish, read, proxy, record and playback video and audio streams. It has been conceived as a
  "media router" that routes media streams from one end to the other.
