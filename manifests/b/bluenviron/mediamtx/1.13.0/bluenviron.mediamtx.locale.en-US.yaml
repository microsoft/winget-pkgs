ShortDescription: |-
  Ready-to-use SRT / WebRTC / RTSP / RTMP / LL-HLS media server and media proxy that allows to read,
  publish, proxy, record and playback video and audio streams.
Description: |-
  MediaMTX is a ready-to-use and zero-dependency real-time media server and media proxy that allows
  to publish, read, proxy, record and playback video and audio streams. It has been conceived as a
  "media router" that routes media streams from one end to the other.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  New major features
  RTSP
  - support encrypting UDP and UDP-multicast streams (#4690)
  General
  - support routing KLV metadata (#2693) (#4670)
  Fixes and improvements
  General
  - recorder, playback: support changing codec parameters without switching segment (#4262) (#4582)
  - record: support storing timezone in recording segments (#3566) (#4597)
  - support assigning paths to different configurations without closing stream (#4576)
  - add attestation system to protect binaries (#4012) (#4629) this allows to prove that binaries were produced by GitHub Actions.
  - fix crash when ConfWatcher fails to initialize (#4689)
  RTSP
  - support encrypted streams with SRTP and MIKEY (bluenviron/gortsplib#520) (bluenviron/gortsplib#809)
  - make RTP packet size compatible with RTSP/SRTP (#4692) when RTSP encryption is enabled, maximum RTP packet size is slightly decreased to make room for SRTP.
  - client: fix reading sources without server ports (#4253) (bluenviron/gortsplib#796) RTCP packets were sent out to nil addresses, due to the lack of server ports, causing an error.
  - client: prevent downgrading from RTSPS to RTSP during redirect (bluenviron/gortsplib#816)
  - client: when reading multicast streams, write unicast reports (bluenviron/gortsplib#817) Previously, receiver reports were broadcasted to all connected clients. Now they are sent to the server only.
  - client: when reading UDP streams, write reports to right IP (bluenviron/gortsplib#818) source IPs sent by the server were not taken into consideration. Thisfixes the issue.
  - set SSRC of outgoing packets (bluenviron/gortsplib#803) In client and server, each format now has a fixed, unique, known in advance SSRC, that is applied to outgoing packets belonging to each format. This is needed to support SRTP/MIKEY, that require each format to have a fixed, unique, and known in advance SSRC.
  - client: open firewall before sending PLAY request (bluenviron/gortsplib#821) this prevents losing some initial packets.
  - support KLV tracks (bluenviron/gortsplib#808)
  RTMP
  - fix timeout when publishing with GLive T80 (#4002) (#4583)
  HLS
  - muxer: fix race condition when closing (bluenviron/gohlslib#236)
  - client: fix race condition with non-low-latency streams (bluenviron/gohlslib#237)
  - Support Verkada EXTINF Tags (bluenviron/gohlslib#244)
  WebRTC
  - fix writing tracks to some clients (#4602) some clients require PayloadType to be unique among all tracks, not only among tracks of same kind.
  RPI Camera
  - fix RTP packet size (#4691) UDP max payload size was not applied.

  Security
  Binaries have been produced by the Release workflow without human intervention.
  You can verify that binaries have been produced by the workflow by using GitHub Attestations:
  ls mediamtx_* | xargs -L1 gh attestation verify --repo bluenviron/mediamtx
  You can verify the binaries checksum by downloading checksums.sha256 and running:
  cat checksums.sha256 | grep "$(ls mediamtx_*)" | sha256sum --check
