ShortDescription: |-
  Ready-to-use SRT / WebRTC / RTSP / RTMP / LL-HLS media server and media proxy that allows to read,
  publish, proxy, record and playback video and audio streams.
Description: |-
  MediaMTX is a ready-to-use and zero-dependency real-time media server and media proxy that allows
  to publish, read, proxy, record and playback video and audio streams. It has been conceived as a
  "media router" that routes media streams from one end to the other.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Fixes and improvements
  General
  - fill product version of Windows executable (#5167) (#5511)
  - improve JSON decoder performance (#5526) avoid decoding JSON twice.
  - fix panic when setting writeQueueSize to zero (#5360) (#5527)
  - prevent using alwaysAvailableFile and alwaysAvailableTracks together (#5529)
  - improve playback precision of alwaysAvailable offline segment (#5530)
  - fix MPEG-4 audio configuration not matching error (#5468) (#5533) This happened when using alwaysAvailableFile and a MPEG-4 audio track.
  - fix corrupted video with alwaysAvailableFile (#5534) when alwaysAvailableFile points to a file with a H265 or H264 track, server is started, an online stream is published and then closed, video was getting corrupted since the online video was overriding the parameters of the offline video.
  - fix audio from alwaysAvailableFile not being streamed (#5535)
  - fix alwaysAvailableFile restarting when a publisher fails (#5536) when a publisher try to start an online stream and there's an error, alwaysAvailableFile restarted without any reason.
  - revert to Go 1.25 (#5521) (#5538) It seems like Go 1.26 is causing segmentation faults, related to channels, on Windows.
  - inherit MPEG-4 audio type from alwaysAvailableFile (#5539)
  - mpegts: properly compute PTS of async KLV frames (bluenviron/mediacommon#291) (bluenviron/mediacommon#311) Store last valid PTS as soon as possible, by parsing PES headers in advance, then use this PTS as timestamp of KLV frames without PTS.
  HLS
  - client: fix initial packet loss after astits upgrade (bluenviron/gohlslib#331)
