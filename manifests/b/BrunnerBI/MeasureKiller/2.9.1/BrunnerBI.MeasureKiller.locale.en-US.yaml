ShortDescription: An external tool for Power BI & Microsoft Fabric
Description: |-
  Measure Killer can help you clean and optimize your tenant and datasets. This can drastically reduce dataset refresh times and thus lower the memory and CPU usage of your Premium capacity. Since we use the XMLA connection, the dataset can remain in the service. Additionally, we only analyze the metadata, we do not read the actual data in your dataset.
  In this 5th mode of Measure Killer, we will be able to give an overview of the whole tenant and show e.g. which reports are using custom visuals or have report-level measures. Additionally, we will be able to provide an overview of all datasets and reports incl. number of pages, visuals etc.
  Measure Killer can delete unused measures on its own if the user chooses so. Alternatively it can generate a C# script for the measures to be deleted via Tabular Editor manually.
  Deleting unused columns will also improve performance since less RAM will be consumed.
  Measure Killer will generate an M-Code to delete unused columns. This code can be pasted into Power Query's Advanced Editor to remove these columns from the model.
  For every report analyzed, Measure Killer will generate a comprehensive Excel file to show where an artifact is used. This can be in: Measures, Visuals, Filters, Conditional Formatting, Joins in Power Query, or other parts of a Power BI Report such as Relationships.
  Furthermore, Measure Killer can generate a chart to show the number of unused and used columns and measures.
