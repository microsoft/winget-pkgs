ShortDescription: Re-Inventing the API Client
Description: |-
  Bruno is a Fast and Git-Friendly Opensource API client, aimed at revolutionizing the status quo
  represented by Postman, Insomnia and similar tools out there.

  Bruno stores your collections directly in a folder on your filesystem.
  We use a plain text markup
  language, Bru, to save information about API requests.

  You can use git or any version control of your choice to collaborate over your API collections.

  Bruno is offline-only.
  There are no plans to add cloud-sync to Bruno, ever.
