  Revu 21.8 - Release Notes
  What’s New
  - Round Corners – Round one or more corners for Polygon and Polyline markups.
  - Studio Project Search now includes markup results per file which link directly to their location.
  - Delete a whole word when editing text markups in Revu by pressing Ctrl+Backspace.
  Task Link
  Task Link is an integration between Bluebeam Revu and GoCanvas that empowers office users to dispatch tasks to field teams and access real-time field updates within Revu. It requires a paid Bluebeam and GoCanvas Lite subscription or above. It is available for all global regions. GoCanvas supports only US-EN language.
  - Drop a markup on the drawing, assign a GoCanvas mobile form, and send it straight to your field team.
  - Your field team will get notified to complete the form in the GoCanvas app with everything they need—task details, reference Revu PDF drawings, and a due date.
  - The completed form shows up in Revu, linked right to the markup, so your office team always has the latest updates from the field.
  What’s Fixed
  - When placing an Area Measurement that has a highlighted fill, it appears opaque and blocks the view of the document when trying to place the Markup.
  - Issue with some Vitrium locked files not opening in Revu.
  - When opening a PDF that is an Outlook attachment, the screen is blank on ARM64 computers.
  - Polygonal Area measurements disappear at certain angles during placement.
  - Output folder in Stapler wizard always reverts back to Custom Folder and default system save path.
  - Clicking a link in a file continually launches new web tabs.
  - When printing from AutoCAD to the Bluebeam PDF Printer, the page is rotated 90 degrees.
  - Some links open within a web tab instead of being opened as a PDF file.
  - Cannot copy under Properties, Project Path links in Projects or Original Location in Studio Sessions.
  - Files containing JavaScript to submit Form do not work.
  - Additional improvements and fixes.
