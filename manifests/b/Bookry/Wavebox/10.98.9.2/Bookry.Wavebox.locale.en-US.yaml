ShortDescription: Transform all your favorite web apps into one desktop app. The ultimate productivity app.
Description: |
  Unlike browser tabs, which work independently, Wavebox brings everything together as a single suite of web apps.
  For example, you’ll get notified on anything new across all your apps without having to check each tabs individually.
  You’ll also find it easier maintain context across workflows and stay focused.
