ShortDescription: A ball dodging game
Description: >
  In this game you control a green ball. Using your mouse or keyboard, you have to avoid hitting the ever increasing number of red balls that are moving around in the game window. The moment you touch one of them, the game is over.


  The game has three difficulty levels and two modes:

  - Time: you have to dodge the red balls for as long as possible. Every few seconds a new red ball appears. The longer you last, the higher the score will be.

  - Coins: you have to catch as many coins as you can. Every few coins a new red ball appears. The more coins you gather, the higher the score will be.


  During the game different bonuses can also appear. These can provide either a positive or a negative effect.
