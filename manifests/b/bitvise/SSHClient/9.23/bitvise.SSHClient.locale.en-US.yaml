# Agreements:
ReleaseNotes: |-
  * Terminal:
    * When the alternative window buffer is activated, the terminal window now prevents client-side scrolling. This interfered with display of server-side applications which provide their own scrolling via keyboard.

  * SFTP drive:
    * There exist servers, such as GlobalSCAPE, which support neither the SFTP request space-available, nor the alternative statvfs@openssh.com. These requests are used to query free space on the server. With such servers, this information cannot be queried, so the SSH Client will now report a very large amount of free space on the SFTP drive. The client previously reported zero free space, which prevented some applications from writing files.
