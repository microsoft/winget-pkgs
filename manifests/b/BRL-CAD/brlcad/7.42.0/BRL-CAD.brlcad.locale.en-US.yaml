ReleaseNotes: |-
  --- 2025-08-11 Release 7.42.0 ---
  Polygonal BoT ray tracing is now dramatically faster. Integration of
  a new spatial partition acceleration method (HLBVH) into librt's BoT
  ray tracing pipeline yields substantial speedups, better multicore
  scaling, and reduced memory overhead across all BRL-CAD ray tracing of
  scenes with BoTs. In general, new overall performence is typicaly in
  the 2-25x range depending on the model, scene, and other factors. The
  culmination of many efforts, the improvement was verified, validated,
  and performance tested against numerous real and test models to
  confirm gains and assert correctness. As a result, users no longer
  need to tune TIE or ADRT-specific settings as both are fully obsoleted
  and replaced.
  This release expands Arbitrary Polyhedron support with 8 vertices
  (i.e., ARB8-only, not ARB7/6/5/4) to include concave definitions.
  Surfaces must (still) be planar and not self-intersect, but polyhedral
  edges creating concavities are now supported for ray tracing.
  MGED's nirt command use of .mgedrc qray settings was restored, which
  affects output styling (e.g., showing/hiding attributes). To restore
  default behavior, delete .mgedrc in your home directory or remove
  existing qray settings manually.
