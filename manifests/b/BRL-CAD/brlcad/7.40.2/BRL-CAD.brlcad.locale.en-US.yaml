ReleaseNotes: |-
  This major release of BRL-CAD improves the robustness of the facetize
  command.  Building on work begun in 7.38.0, for the first time BRL-CAD
  is able to successfully facetize all of BRL-CAD's example geometries.
  This involves a major change to the processing pipeline of the
  facetize command, allowing handling of individual primitives to be
  fault tolerant and automatically attempting fallback methods.
  Historically BRL-CAD facetize has attempted to produce output meshes
  even when individual operations fail by silently skipping over failing
  inputs, but now this behavior is changed to a stricter policy of
  halting when individual elements of the process do not succeed.This release also incorporates the tool 'gist' for generating a one
  page graphical overview and summary of the contents of a .g database.
  This tool is the culmination of work by multiple student teams from
  Texas A&M University and incorporates automatic layout features to
  produce geometry-appropriate visual arrangements.Also new in this release are capabilities for testing and repairing
  triangle meshes.   The lint command will now validate solid BoT
  behavior with the raytracer, and the 'bot repair' command is able to
  perform hole filling operations on some categories of non-manifold
  BoTs.  Another related new feature allows users to generate explicit
  volumetric BoTs using plate mode BoTs as inputs via the 'bot extrude'
  command.This release introduces a major change in the management of 3rd party
  dependencies.  The src/other directory has been replaced by an
  external repository specifically tasked with the job of managing 3rd
  party libraries.  By default BRL-CAD will download and build necessary
  dependencies as part of its build automatically.  However, note that
  an internet connection is required by default to access this
  repository.  See the INSTALL file for more details and options for
  preparing to build without internet availability.Developers requiring only a subset of BRL-CAD (for example, if a
  project only needs librt and its dependencies) can now define subsets
  of BRL-CAD to build with the BRLCAD_COMPONENTS variable.  See INSTALL
  for more information.
