ShortDescription: Borica software application to assist with signing and managing egov/trusted platforms access.
Description: |
  BISS (Browser Independent Signing Service) is software for signing with Qualified Electronic Signature (QES) when performing operations in the Internet browser. It uses technology that allows local electronic signature without using an active component. A major advantage of using BISS is its independence from the browser used and its restrictions or inability to support Java applets or ActiveX controls.
  BISS provides QES certificates for all popular browsers under operating systems MS Windows 8, MS Windows 10, Linux Ubuntu 18.04 LTS/20.04 LTS and macOS Catalina. It works with each use of the private key of the QES certificate located on the smart card. BISS uses Microsoft CryptoAPI or PKCS11 library to access the smart card.
  To use BISS, it is necessary to pre-install the service as an application on the workstation where the signing will be done - administrator rights are required.
