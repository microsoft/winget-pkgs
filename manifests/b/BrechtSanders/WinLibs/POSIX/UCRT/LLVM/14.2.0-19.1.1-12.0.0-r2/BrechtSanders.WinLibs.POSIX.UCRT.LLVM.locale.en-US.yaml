ShortDescription: A standalone build of GCC and MinGW-w64 for Windows, with POSIX threading library, UCRT runtime library and LLVM/Clang/LLD/LLDB.
Description: |-
  In short: it's a free C and C++ compiler for Microsoft Windows.
  GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) is a free and open source compiler for C and C++ (and other languages like Objective-C, Fortran, D).
  MinGW-w64 is a free and open source C library for targetting Windows 32-bit and 64-bit platforms.
  The combination of these results in a free C/C++ compiler for Windows.
  Even though GCC and MinGW-w64 can be used on other platforms (e.g. Linux) to generate Windows executables, the WinLibs project only focusses on building versions that run natively on Windows.
  Also some additional tools are added, including:
  - GDB - the GNU Project debugger
  - GNU Binutils - a collection of binary tools
  - GNU Make - a tool which controls the generation of executables and other non-source files
  - Yasm - The Yasm Modular Assembler Project
  - NASM - The Netwide Assembler
  - JWasm - A free MASM-compatible assembler
  - LLVM/Clang/LLD/LLDB - The LLVM Compiler Infrastructure
  This is a standalone build, which means this download offers a complete compiler environment for Windows.
  In the future WinLibs plans to also release binary packages of many open source libraries and applications built with this compiler.

  Available downloads:
  - Files with extension .7z and .zip have the same contents.
    The .7z files are smaller but require 7-Zip or PeaZip to extract.
    The .zip files are larger but Windows can extract this file without additional tools.
  - The i686 download is the Windows Intel/AMD 32-bit version, which runs natively on and compiles for Windows 32-bit (also runs on Windows 64-bit in 32-bit mode).
    The x86_64 download is the Windows Intel/AMD 64-bit version, which runs natively on and compiles for Windows 64-bit.
  - The .sha256 and .sha512 files are checksum files for validating the download.
  Changes:
  - GNU Binutils 2.43.1
  - CMake 3.30.4
  - Doxygen 1.12.0
