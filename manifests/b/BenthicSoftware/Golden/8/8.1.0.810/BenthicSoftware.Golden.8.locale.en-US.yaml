  - Documented the -t: command-line option to set TNS_ADMIN.

  - Fixed an issue with caret placement in some cases of the popup typing helper.
  - Fixed an issue when closing the application with a pending SQLBuilder load.
  - Fixed an issue handling certain EZConnect Plus logins.
  - Added Ctrl-Click to the Find button to start from top instead of current position.
  - Added "Show private tab menu" option on the advanced options page for users who'd like to use Private tabs. Generally it's better to use multiple instances of Golden with separate logins.
