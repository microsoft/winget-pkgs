ShortDescription: Oracle Import/Export Tool
Description: |-
  ImpExpPro is an import/export tool for Oracle databases. This application allows you to import data into tables, export query data to text files, and run SQL and PL/SQL commands. Imports, Exports and Command specification can be saved to files to be loaded and run later.
  This application also includes two "runner" applications:
  - ImpExpRunner allows running Import, Export and Command files while giving feedback and allowing the user to cancel the process.
  - ImpExpRunnerCmd is a command line version (a "console" program) that can be used when you don't need a user interface (such as from batch files.) It is optimized to be quick and resource friendly.
