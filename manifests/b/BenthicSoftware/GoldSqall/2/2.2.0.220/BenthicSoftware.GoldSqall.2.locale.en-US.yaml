ReleaseNotes: |-
  - New native protocol for DuckDB!
  - Greatly improved SQL Formatter with new keyword casing and prefixed comma options.
  - New "Case only" formatting action.
  - New "Autosave directory" option.
  - New /*-*/ prefix for bypassing a local command to process it on the server as a command.
  An example would be the DuckDB "export" command which conflicts with our local export command. To run that command on the server use:
  /*-*/export database 'filename';
  - New /*+*/ prefix for bypassing a local command and/or to force it to be handled as a query.
  A good exmple of this is SQLite's PRAGMA statement which can be run and returns results by using:
  /*+*/ PRAGMA main.table_info('mytable');
  - Updated help section "How to use the SQL Formatter".
