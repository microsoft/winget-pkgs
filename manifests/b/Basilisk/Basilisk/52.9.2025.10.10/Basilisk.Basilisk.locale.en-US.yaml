ShortDescription: A XUL-based web-browser built on top of the Unified XUL Platform (UXP). This browser is a close twin to pre-Servo Firefox in how it operates.
Description: Basilisk is a free and Open Source XUL-based web browser, featuring the well-known Firefox-style interface and operation. It is based on the Goanna layout and rendering engine (a fork of Gecko) and builds on the Unified XUL Platform (UXP), which in turn is a fork of the Mozilla code base without Servo or Rust.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  This Basilisk release integrates all Pale Moon changes from 33.8.1 through 33.9.1, introducing major web platform improvements, enhanced standards compliance, Linux stability fixes, and multiple security patches.
  - Implemented CSS4 revert keyword and the clip keyword for overflow.
  - Implemented CSS axis-shorthand parsing of overflow, resolving unscrollable areas on some websites.
  - Implemented color-mix() (RGB and HSL color spaces).
  - Implemented @supports(selector(<complex selector>)) and CSS Cascade Layers via @layer.
  - Implemented clip-path:<geometry-box> usage without explicit paths.
  - Implemented overflow-inline and overflow-block properties.
  - Implemented :autofill and :focus-visible CSS pseudo-classes.
  - Implemented the prefers-reduced-motion media query.
  - Implemented a minimal visualViewport API.
  - Un-prefixed user-select, :read-only, and :read-write to align with the current CSS4 specification.
  - Improved parsing of X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff and corrected regressions from earlier updates.
  - Changed @import processing to follow order of appearance in stylesheets.
  - Aligned TypedArray constructors with the ECMAScript spec (invalid or undefined initializers now return empty arrays).
  - Improved multi-header Cache-Control parsing.
  - Address bar focus state now correctly resets when navigating to #fragment anchors.
  - Cookies without valid names are now rejected per RFC 6265; nameless cookies (beginning with =) are no longer accepted.
  - Added FFmpeg 7.0 / libavcodec 61 support for improved multimedia compatibility.
  - Fixed border-image sub-property update bug.
  - Fixed scrollbar-width inheritance handling.
  - Explicitly initialized fontconfig on Linux startup to fix missing font issues.
  - Fixed color-depth reporting inconsistencies on Linux.
  - Fixed VPX and ffvpx build issues on PowerPC and non-assembly architectures.
  - Fixed a memory safety issue in gradient color-stop handling.
  - Improved DevTools “Copy as cURL” reliability.
  - Adjusted CSP URI reporting and data-load restrictions for <object> elements to better follow modern web standards.
  - Fixed WebAssembly table size limit handling to align with other engines.
  - Fixed crashes and regressions introduced in prior <object> restriction code.
  - Fixed address bar dropdown highlight styling regression.
  - Numerous Defense-in-Depth and memory safety improvements across components.
  - Built on UXP commit: 545d52572d
  - Security issues addressed: CVE-2025-10536, CVE-2025-10533 (DiD), CVE-2025-9181, CVE-2025-8031, CVE-2025-8028 (DiD), CVE-2025-8037, CVE-2025-8029, and additional non-CVE fixes.
  Implementation notes
  - overflow: clip now fully conforms to the CSS specification. Clipped overflow is hidden and unscrollable. If only one axis is specified, the other remains visible but cannot be scrolled.
  - clip-path:<geometry-box> can now be used without a path definition, resolving prior cases where blank content appeared.
  - visualViewport is minimally implemented for desktop environments: fixed (0,0) origin, root scrollframe dimensions, and scale factor = 1.0.
  - TypedArrays with invalid or undefined initializers no longer throw; they return a zero-length array instead.
  - Cookies: nameless cookies (starting with =) are now rejected outright. Cookies without an equals sign are interpreted as valueless named cookies, improving RFC compliance and preventing malformed cookie injection.
