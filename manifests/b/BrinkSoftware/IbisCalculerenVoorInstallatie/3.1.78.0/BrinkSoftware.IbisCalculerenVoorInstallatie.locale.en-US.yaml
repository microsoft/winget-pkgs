ShortDescription: Calculation and Cost Estimation for Installation Technology
Description: In recent years, installations have played an increasingly important role in architectural and civil engineering projects. This is because they have become technically more complex and have a greater impact on the sustainability and user comfort of buildings, structures, and infrastructure routes. For Brink, these are reasons to expand support for them in a number of applications.
