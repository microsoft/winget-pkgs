  Features
  Remote AMS drying support
  You can now start AMS drying directly from Studio’s Device page for AMS 2 Pro and AMS HT.
  - Click the humidity button on the target AMS to open the control dialog to Start and Stop the drying feature.
  - You can now dry filament while printing, but the drying temperature will be lowered during printing.
  > ⚠ Minimum supported firmware version: 01.02.30.00（H2D）

  Optimized prime tower strategy for PLA & PETG mixing print
  Mixing PLA and PETG print is a common user scenario where one filament is used as support for the other one. We noticed that prime tower stability could be further improved under “low-adhesion” conditions. To address typical cases where bonding is difficult, we optimized the interface-layer temperature, extrusion, ironing, and flushing workflow:
  - Interface-layer temperature boost for better adhesion: Added a new parameter to increase the interface-layer temperature. -1 means boosting it to the material’s maximum printing temperature.
  - Extra pre-extrusion before printing the interface layer: Added new parameters for interface-layer pre-extrusion distance and length. Before printing the prime tower, the interface layer now performs a short pre-extrusion to build pressure and extend the extrusion path.
  - Improved ironing strategy: Ironing is no longer applied to the interface layer. Added a configurable ironing area parameter for non-interface layers to preserve better flow behavior (especially for PETG).
  - Reduced infill speed on the layer after the interface layer: By slowing down the infill of the next layer, the base becomes more stable, improving interface-layer adhesion.
  - Additional flushing for the interface layer: Added flushing actions for the interface layer. Studio will do nozzle wiping before flushing rather than after flushing, and print the prime tower directly, reducing extrusion volume fluctuations and improving layer height consistency. Added a new parameter for interface-layer flushing length.
  - Notch at the interface-layer starting point: Added a notch at the start of the interface layer to reduce extrusion pressure and prevent the nozzle from dragging due to an oversized blob.
    With the above adjustments and validation tests, we confirmed this optimization effectively reduces prime tower collapse in scenarios such as PETG used as the support interface for PLA.
  > ⚠️ Note: The above parameters are only visible in Developer Mode.

  Ironing on the support interface
  Introduce ironing capability for support interfaces. When printing without support materials, you can try this feature to achieve better support-surface quality. Thanks to @Noisyfox for the contribution.

  Non-100% infill patterns for top/bottom surfaces
  Top and bottom surfaces now support non-100% infill patterns, enabling more visual styles and creative effects. Thanks to @Buildasaurus for the contribution.

  Standard 3MF color parsing support
  Added support for importing standard 3MF files with color information. After import, the workflow is similar to multi-color OBJ: select the color data to map and apply colors.
  > ℹ️ Colored standard 3MF files are supported by tools such as Fusion 360/Meshmixer/OpenSCAD. Please refer to their documentation or the official 3MF standard site(https://3mf.io/) for details.
  > ⚠ Note: Currently, only face color and vertex color data are supported. For texture-colored 3MF files, only face data will be imported.

  Mesh subdivision
  You can now right-click a part and choose Subdivide Part to apply Loop subdivision with multiple iterations. This is useful for models with low original mesh resolution.
  > ⚠ Note:
  > 1. Only meshes without non-manifold edges are supported.
  > 2. Color attributes will be lost after subdivision. We recommend subdividing first, then painting and applying colors.
  Scale to print volume
  Right-click a selected part to scale it up to the maximum size supported by the current print volume, while keeping axis proportions unchanged.
  Abort load/unload filament process
  Studio now supports stopping the filament Load / Unload operations.
  > ⚠ Note: Supported printers: A1/A1 mini/P1P/P1S. More models will be supported in future versions.

  2D Lattice infill
  Added 2D Lattice infill, suitable for lightweight structures such as wings. It includes two angle parameters for adjusting infill direction. Thanks to @LoftedAero for the contribution.

  Consistent Surface & Short Travel Acceleration (Experimental)
  To reduce common VFA artifacts, we introduced two options (visible only in Developer Mode):
  - Consistent Surface: When enabled, the speed planner prioritizes reducing speeds in regions like infill first, and only reduces outer wall speed when necessary. This improves surface consistency, especially for glossy or silk filaments.

  ────────────┴────────────
  - Short Travel Acceleration: Adjust this parameter to apply a gentler, lower acceleration for short-distance moves on the outer wall, helping reduce artifacts caused by short-travel acceleration/deceleration. The current short travel acceleration is implemented as a global parameter, with a default value set to 250 mm/s².

  Thanks to @lorenzofanchi and PrusaSlicer for their contributions.
  > ⚠ Note: These options are currently only available in Developer Mode.
  Improvements
  1. Introduced support for TPU printing with the H2D left extruder.
  > ⚠️ Note:
  > - Minimum supported firmware version: 01.02.30.00 (H2D)
  > - The left extruder currently supports only TPU filaments with a hardness rating of 90A or higher
  2. Added tungsten carbide nozzles , with support for H2D/H2S/H2C/P2S.
  > ⚠️ Minimum Required Firmware Versions:
  > - P2S: 01.01.01.00
  > - H2D: 01.02.30.00
  > - H2S: 01.01.30.00
  > - H2C: 01.01.00.00
  3. Added support for TPU High-Flow nozzles (which will be available in the store soon). The process parameter “Top surface flow ratio” is now split into separate settings for the left and right extruders.

  ────────────
  > ⚠️ Note:
  > - Minimum Required Firmware Version: H2D: 01.02.30.00
  > - When importing older dual extruders' 3MF files in which “Top Surface Flow Ratio” was modified, the adjusted value will be migrated only to the left extruder. The parameter for the right extruder must be reconfigured manually.
  4. Improved mapping interaction when sending a print: To reduce mapping ambiguity for multi-extruder setups, Studio now displays all AMS information when sending a print, making the mapping logic clearer. More mapping rules can be found on Bambu Wiki.

  5. Optimized hardness-check logic when sending a print: When filament hardness exceeds nozzle hardness, Studio will no longer block printing immediately, and a clearer warning will be shown.

  6. Improved auto-arrange results.
