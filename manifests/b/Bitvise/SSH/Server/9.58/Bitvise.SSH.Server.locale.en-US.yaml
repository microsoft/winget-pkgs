ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Startup:
    - During SSH Server startup, it is unusual, but possible, for Windows APIs to block initialization of SSH Server components for long periods of time. If the delay was very long, the Long Operations Monitor, a new component in versions 9.5x, could exit unexpectedly if other components have not yet initialized.
      The initialization sequence is now reorganized to avoid this type of issue. Additionally, long delays during component initialization are now logged at Info or Trace level, depending on the duration.
  - FTPS:
    - For FTPS connections, the SSH Server no longer adds the authorized_keys mount point (by default, "/.ssh") if SSH public key management using authorized_keys is enabled for the user.
      Previous 9.5x versions would add this mount point for FTPS, even though SSH public key management is not supported using FTPS. Connections that tried to access this path via FTPS would become unresponsive, although the connection would still respond to disconnect.
