ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Master/follower synchronization:
    - When configured as a master or secondary master, the SSH Server no longer subjects authentication attempts from followers to logon serialization if the provided synchronization password is correct. This avoids some of the followers receiving disconnects, and having to retry, if many followers connect at the same time.
  - Control Panel:
    - The feature Query settings with PowerShell did not detect that PowerShell is available when installed on Hyper-V Server 2019. Fixed.
