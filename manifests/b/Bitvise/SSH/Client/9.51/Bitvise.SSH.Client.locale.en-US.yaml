ShortDescription: Free SSH file transfer, terminal and tunneling
Description: |-
  Our SSH client supports all desktop and server versions of Windows, 32-bit and 64-bit, from Windows XP SP3 and Windows Server 2003, up to the most recent – Windows 11 and Windows Server 2025.
  Our client is free for use of all types, including in organizations.
  Our SSH and SFTP client for Windows incorporates:
  - One of the most advanced graphical SFTP clients.
  - Single-click Remote Desktop forwarding.
  - State-of-the-art terminal emulation with support for the bvterm, xterm, and vt100 protocols.
  - Support for corporation-wide single sign-on using SSPI (GSSAPI) Kerberos 5 and NTLM user authentication, as well as Kerberos 5 host authentication.
  - Support for ECDSA, RSA and DSA public key authentication with comprehensive user keypair management.
  - Encryption and security: Provides state-of-the-art encryption and security suitable as part of a standards-compliant solution meeting the requirements of PCI, HIPAA, or FIPS 140-2 validation.
  - SSH jump proxy: Connect to a final destination SSH or SFTP server by connecting through an SSH jump server. In the graphical SSH Client, this is configured in Proxy settings, on the Login tab.
  - Obfuscated SSH with an optional keyword. When supported and enabled in both the client and server, obfuscation makes it more difficult for an observer to detect that the protocol being used is SSH. (Protocol; OpenSSH patches)
  - Powerful SSH port forwarding capabilities, including dynamic forwarding through integrated SOCKS and HTTP CONNECT proxy.
  - Powerful command-line parameters which make the SSH client highly customizable and suitable for use in specific situations and controlled environments.
  - SFTP drive mapping: Access files on an SFTP server as if they were local, from any Windows application.
  - An FTP-to-SFTP bridge allowing you to connect to an SFTP server using legacy FTP applications.
  - An advanced, scriptable command-line SFTP client, sftpc.
  - A scriptable command-line remote execution client, sexec, and a command-line terminal console client, stermc.
  - A scriptable command-line tunneling client, stnlc, with support for static port forwarding rules, dynamic SOCKS-based tunneling, and FTP-to-SFTP bridge.
  - Our .NET SSH library, FlowSshNet, with example PowerShell scripts showing how to use the SSH library for file transfer and remote program execution from PowerShell.
  - Bitvise SSH Server remote administration features.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Automatic updates:
    - Separate proxy settings can now be configured for automatic updates. This allows checks for updates, and downloads of new version installers, to use a different proxy than the one configured in Windows.
  - SSH:
    - Bitvise SSH Server, SSH Client and FlowSsh now support hybrid post-quantum and classical key exchange using the key exchange methods mlkem1024nistp384-sha384 and mlkem768x25519-sha256. These key exchange methods use algorithms outside of Windows cryptography. They are only available when FIPS 140 cryptography mode is not enabled in Windows. The new algorithms require Windows Vista or newer.
    - The SSH Client can now be configured to Require strict key exchange. Strict key exchange is a recent SSH protocol feature supported since Bitvise software versions 9.32. It mitigates the Terrapin vulnerability in SSH implementations prior to December 2023 (CVE-2023-48795). If the SSH connection does not use strict key exchange, the encryption algorithm chacha20-poly1305 is particularly vulnerable.
  - Graphical SSH Client:
    - The SSH Client now supports dark mode. This can be enabled using the main SSH Client window > App settings.
    - When selecting a client authentication keypair, the SSH Client now displays a truncated comment. This makes it easier to tell which key is which.
    - App settings (previously, Window behavior) can now be controlled using command-line parameters. This is of particular interest for users who use -noRegistry.
    - Settings for pop-up notifications can now be configured using App settings, in addition to the icon menu in the system notification area.
    - The SSH Client now detects when another SSH Client instance is already connected to the same server, using the same username. This is to help users notice when they have an existing SSH Client instance hidden in the system notification area.
    - When importing a client authentication keypair, the SSH Client now more thoroughly detects duplicates.
  - Graphical SFTP:
    - Local and Remote SFTP settings are now configurable in separate dialogs. These settings can now be edited via the SFTP window.
    - Settings are now supported to express a preference whether the server should use unbuffered I/O. The preference is effective when connecting to Bitvise SSH Server 9.34 or newer, if server-side settings permit.
      The sftpc command-line client supports the equivalent -noBuf switch for get and put commands since version 9.34.
    - When the remote directory contains symbolic links, the SSH Client must resolve them to know if an entry is a file or a directory. This requires an SFTP request for each symbolic link. For directories that contain many symbolic links which cannot be resolved, the SSH Client now gives up if it encounters 10 failures without any successes.
    - The feature to Open or Edit remote files uses a temporary local directory. If something removes this directory, the SSH Client now tries to re-create it.
  - Terminal window:
    - Font ligatures are now rendered, when using fonts that support them.
  - Command-line clients:
    - sftpc no longer reports an error if the server disconnects during the quit or exit command.
    - The sexec and stermc command-line clients now support consecutive execution of multiple commands using -cmdFile=... or using multiple -cmd=... parameters.
    - The sexec command-line client now supports an -inputEOL=... parameter to control how input newlines should be sent to the remote process. Default behavior remains to perform no conversion.
    - The sexec command-line client now supports a -conInMode=... parameter to control how input should be read from the console (when input is not redirected from a pipe or file). Default behavior is now to read individual keystrokes and send them promptly, without local echo.
    - The retry utility now supports -m=0 for infinite retries.
  - Port forwarding:
    - Bitvise SSH Client, stnlc and FlowSsh now support port forwarding (connection tunneling) to and from server-side Unix sockets. To use a Unix socket as the forwarding source or destination, enter the socket path (starting with "/") and leave the port empty.
      This requires a server running on Linux or Unix. Only server-side Unix sockets are supported. The client side of the port forwarding must still use TCP/IP.
