ShortDescription: Free SSH file transfer, terminal and tunneling
Description: |-
  Our SSH client supports all desktop and server versions of Windows, 32-bit and 64-bit, from Windows XP SP3 and Windows Server 2003, up to the most recent â€“ Windows 11 and Windows Server 2025.
  Our client is free for use of all types, including in organizations.
  Our SSH and SFTP client for Windows incorporates:
  - One of the most advanced graphical SFTP clients.
  - Single-click Remote Desktop forwarding.
  - State-of-the-art terminal emulation with support for the bvterm, xterm, and vt100 protocols.
  - Support for corporation-wide single sign-on using SSPI (GSSAPI) Kerberos 5 and NTLM user authentication, as well as Kerberos 5 host authentication.
  - Support for ECDSA, RSA and DSA public key authentication with comprehensive user keypair management.
  - Encryption and security: Provides state-of-the-art encryption and security suitable as part of a standards-compliant solution meeting the requirements of PCI, HIPAA, or FIPS 140-2 validation.
  - SSH jump proxy: Connect to a final destination SSH or SFTP server by connecting through an SSH jump server. In the graphical SSH Client, this is configured in Proxy settings, on the Login tab.
  - Obfuscated SSH with an optional keyword. When supported and enabled in both the client and server, obfuscation makes it more difficult for an observer to detect that the protocol being used is SSH. (Protocol; OpenSSH patches)
  - Powerful SSH port forwarding capabilities, including dynamic forwarding through integrated SOCKS and HTTP CONNECT proxy.
  - Powerful command-line parameters which make the SSH client highly customizable and suitable for use in specific situations and controlled environments.
  - SFTP drive mapping: Access files on an SFTP server as if they were local, from any Windows application.
  - An FTP-to-SFTP bridge allowing you to connect to an SFTP server using legacy FTP applications.
  - An advanced, scriptable command-line SFTP client, sftpc.
  - A scriptable command-line remote execution client, sexec, and a command-line terminal console client, stermc.
  - A scriptable command-line tunneling client, stnlc, with support for static port forwarding rules, dynamic SOCKS-based tunneling, and FTP-to-SFTP bridge.
  - Our .NET SSH library, FlowSshNet, with example PowerShell scripts showing how to use the SSH library for file transfer and remote program execution from PowerShell.
  - Bitvise SSH Server remote administration features.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Graphical SSH Client:
    - When using public key authentication using a passphrase-protected key, previous SSH Client versions did not refresh client keypair information as intended. After a manual logout, the SSH Client would continue to cache the client key passphrase. If the passphrase was removed, or if it was newly set, the SSH Client did not take the new setting properly into account.
      After a manual logout, client key information is now refreshed. The SSH Client will ask for the client key passphrase during the next login. For automatic reconnect, the passphrase continues to be cached, so that it does not have to be re-entered if the connection is lost and automatically restored.
  - sftpc:
    - The sftpc command-line SFTP client now supports the -ifExist parameter for put and get commands. When -ifExist is passed, the command completes successfully if the source of the transfer does not exist. In previous versions, a wildcard pattern needed to be used to avoid an error if there are no matches.
  - Terminal:
    - When recording a terminal session, the output file is now opened using the Windows flag FILE_SHARE_READ. This allows the file to be viewed in other applications while recording is in progress.
