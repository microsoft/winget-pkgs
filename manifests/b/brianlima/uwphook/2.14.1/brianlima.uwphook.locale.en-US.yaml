ReleaseNotes: |-
  Hello there!
  Just a quick fix because of issue #138 because of an oversight on my part.
  Additionally, there seems to be some problems with some dependencies of the project on some Windows technical preview, so, if you have an error while loading the program or while trying to export games, also report your windows version, so that i can attempt to reproduce it.Changes and new features of this version:- Check if the user has a  shortcuts.vdf  before attempting to back-it-up
  If you face bugs or have questions, head over to our subreddit at http://reddit.com/r/UWPHook or ping me at our issues or my Twitter. Please, also send the contents of the log file located in %appdata%/briano/uwphook/This software is open-source under the MIT License.If you like what i did with it and want to support me, you can cheer me up at my Twitter or pay me a coffee via Paypal, it will help me to continue to build amazing open source tools for you!Thanks for your support, and game on!
