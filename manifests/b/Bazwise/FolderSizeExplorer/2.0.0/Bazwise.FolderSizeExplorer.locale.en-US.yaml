ShortDescription: Folder Size Explorer is similar to Windows Explorer except it calculates folder sizes.
Description: |-
  Folder Size Explorer calculates folder sizes as you browse them and allows you to quickly indentify directories on
  your hard drive or network that are consuming the most disk space. It can also calculate checksums (MD-5, SHA-1,
  SHA-256 and SHA-512) of all your files and can export Windows Explorer folder and file lists to csv files. Folder
  Size Explorer is a simple and fast disk space analyser that also provides almost all the functionality of the
  standard Windows Explorer. It runs on both x86 and x64 versions of Windows 10, 8, 7, Vista, and all versions of
  Windows Server 2019, 2016, 2012, 2008.
