ReleaseNotes: |-
  We are excited to announce the release of UI-TARS-Desktop v0.1.1!
  This update primarily focuses on fixing known issues and improving overall system stability. Below are the key changes:
  Key Changes
  - Significantly enhanced the stability of Browser Operator functionality.
  - Optimized ErrorMessage handling and display, and enhanced the logging system functionality.
  - Fixes for various known stability issues.

  Highlights
  Name Changes
  To better align with product positioning, we have renamed Browser Use and Computer Use to Browser Operator and Computer Operator. Additionally, weâ€™ve added detailed explanations on the homepage to help users better understand these features. (#571)

  Browser Operator Enhancements
  This update greatly improves the stability of Browser Operator.
  - Browser Compatibility: We now support Chrome, Edge, and Firefox, along with their sub-versions (Beta, Dev, Canary). The system will sequentially detect local browsers in the order of Chrome â†’ Edge â†’ Firefox, resolving issues where the target browser could not be found. (#537, #541, #547)
  - Default Search Engine Configuration: Users can now configure their default search engine, ensuring smoother usage of Browser Operator, even in cases of network issues during initialization. (#553)

  - Cross-Platform Shortcuts: Added support for common shortcuts across different OS platforms and browsers (e.g., Select All, Copy, Paste). (#530, #560)
  - Screenshot Fixes: Fixed an issue where the browser page would flicker during screenshots. (#551)

  ErrorMessage Optimization
  Weâ€™ve refined the error-handling mechanisms throughout the app:
  - Error Classification: Reorganized and detailed error states across different stages of the app, and refactored the GUIAgentError type for clearer issue identification. (#534)
  - Log Optimization: Added support for persisting recent history logs, making it easier to troubleshoot and identify past issues. (#548)
  - UI Improvements: Enhanced the UI for ErrorMessage, enabling users and developers to locate issues more efficiently. (#571)

  Other Updates and Fixes
  - Report Enhancements: Reports in HTML format now display model and conversation information. (#574)

  - Bug Fixes:
    - Fixed an issue where manually closing the browser in Browser Operator mode prevented relaunching. (#582)
    - Resolved a white-screen issue caused by empty action_type. (#526)
    - Fixed a white-screen issue when unsupported shortcuts were used with action_type. (#560)
    - Fixed a black-screen background issue when closing the app in full-screen mode. (#575)

  Thank you for your continued support! ðŸŽ‰
