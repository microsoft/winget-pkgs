ReleaseNotes: |-
  Base
  - Departments or teams can create dedicated workspaces to bring all relevant bases and configure member permissions in one central hub, making it easier to manage resources and collaborate.
  - When setting up a button click as the trigger for a workflow or automation, you just need to specify the button type and scope instead of choosing a specific button. Once configured, you can link the button field or block to the workflow or automation, making it easier to link one process to multiple buttons.
  - Formulas can be used in workflows and automations to calculate or process generated data or variables. This allows you to easily apply conditional logic and control data flow, enhancing your automation's flexibility and data-handling capabilities.
  - You can set a default value for a variety of field types, including text, single option and multiple options, number, date, and person fields. This value will automatically populate when users add a new record, saving time, ensuring data consistency, and streamlining analysis.
  Docs
  - You can now add comments to a specific area of an image, making your feedback clearer and more contextual.
