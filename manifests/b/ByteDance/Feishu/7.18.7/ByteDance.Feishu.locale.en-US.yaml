  Slides
  - To hide slides from your audience during a presentation, use the Skip Slide function. Skipped slides remain in your Slides file but are not shown when you give the presentation. Additionally, if you download your Slides file as a PDF, the hidden slides will not be included.
  Meetings
  - During the meeting, the meeting host and co-host can export the participant statistics in real time on the desktop app, and check the participant's attendance in time.
  - You can now search in the meeting history by entering meeting information or filtering by meeting organizer, participant, meeting room, date, and so on.
