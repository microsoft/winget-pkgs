ReleaseNotes: |-
  Base
  - For Feishu Business and Enterprise plan users, you can use condition groups to define the scope of records that can be viewed, edited, or deleted. Each group can include different conditions and follow rules where all conditions must be met or where any single condition can apply, allowing more flexible permission management.
  - Messages sent through Workflow or Automations using the Base app bot as the identity can now include attachments such as images, PDFs, PowerPoint and Excel files, audio, video, and other file formats.
