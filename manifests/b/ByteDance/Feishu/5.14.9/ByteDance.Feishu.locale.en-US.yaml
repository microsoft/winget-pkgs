  - Add Docs or webpages as customized tabs in a chat, and switch between tabs to view messages, Docs, or other content more efficiently.
  - Check your calendar reminders and details of an event in Events placed at the top-right corner on desktop.
  - Record your screen activities, or make tutorial videos on desktop.

  Docs
  - Choose your own cover, add columns for more layout options, and work smarter, not harder with slash commands to insert blocks such as images or sheets.

  Tasks
  - Add Tasks widget to your home screen for easier tracking of your tasks.

  Workplace
  - Use Kuaidi 100 Express Management, Pilot Plan, Feishu People, and YiJing Cloud to handle express management, organization efficiency, talents management, and low code application building.

  Improvements:
  - Scroll up or down a page to capture a scrolling screenshot on desktop.
