ReleaseNotes: |-
  Base
  - When receiving a Feishu message is set as the trigger, both internal and external groups are now supported. You can choose whether the trigger applies only to messages that mention the bot or to all messages in the group, facilitating collaboration within and outside the organization.
  - When configuring an automation or workflow to send messages, you can choose to disable the button in the message once it's clicked. When this option is selected, and the action to perform is running a workflow or automation, you can further specify whether the button is disabled for all users or only the user who clicked the button.
