  Meetings
  - When you record voices on the Feishu mobile app with real-time transcription, Minutes can recognize different voices and split the speeches accordingly. If the speaker has created a voiceprint, their name will be displayed. You can also translate the transcription into English, Chinese, and Japanese in real time and create AI summaries to boost the efficiency of information delivery.
