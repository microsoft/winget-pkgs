  Calendar
  - With one click, you can easily create a similar or identical event by copying an existing one.
  Docs
  - Document details and View history give you fresh insight on your content's engagement data and view history, whether you're using Docs, Sheets, Bitable, or Wiki.
  - Let templates help your team work more efficiently. Share any templates with team members, groups, or insert them in Docs.
  Meetings
