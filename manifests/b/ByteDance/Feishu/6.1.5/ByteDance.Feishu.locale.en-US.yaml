ReleaseNotes: |-
  Meetings
  - When presenters share their desktop or browser windows, the system will auto-recognize Feishu Docs, and with Magic Share mode on, participants can browse content freely.
  - iOS 16.1 now supports live meeting status in the Dynamic Island for better real-time experience.
  - A variety of views are now available for meeting recordings. You can choose from Gallery, Thumbnail, Speaker or Full-screen to flexibly adapt to your needs.

  Messenger
  - You can adjust the zoom level and text size in the app as needed.

  Docs
  - You can now save the translation as a new document and download it to your device.
  - You can notify mentioned people later. Hover over their name in the document anytime to grant them access or send them a notification.
  - Docs can be edited by external users who aren't logged in. An administrator needs to enable this feature and the document needs to be set to "Anyone with the link can edit."

  Sheets
  - Send notifications to all people mentioned in Sheets by going to the ··· menu and clicking People Mentioned.

  Account

  Tasks
  - You can archive a completed task list for later viewing, and your last task filter is set as the default the next time you check your task list.

  Search
  - Administrators can set job titles, business emails, and cities as search filters. They can also customize what information is visible when searching for members.
