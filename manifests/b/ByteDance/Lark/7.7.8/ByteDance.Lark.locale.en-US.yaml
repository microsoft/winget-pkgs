ReleaseNotes: |-
  Base
  - Add text blocks to the dashboard to provide supplementary information or explanations, giving your audience the context they need to interpret the data.
  - Generate a query page in Base to make it easy for everyone to find what they need without getting lost in the complexity of the table. Querying survey responses, event registration status, exam scores, and more no longer have to be difficult.
  Messenger
