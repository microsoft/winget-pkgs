ReleaseNotes: |-
  Base
  - For Lark Pro and Enterprise plan users, you can use condition groups to define the scope of records that can be viewed, edited, or deleted. Each group can include different conditions and follow rules where all conditions must be met or where any single condition can apply, allowing more flexible permission management.
  - Messages sent through Workflow or Automations using the Base app bot as the identity can now include attachments such as images, PDFs, PowerPoint and Excel files, audio, video, and other file formats.
  - When receiving a Lark message is set as the trigger, both internal and external groups are now supported. You can choose whether the trigger applies only to messages that mention the bot or to all messages in the group, facilitating collaboration within and outside the organization.
