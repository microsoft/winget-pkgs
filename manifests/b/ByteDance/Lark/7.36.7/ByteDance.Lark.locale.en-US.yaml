ReleaseNotes: |-
  Base
  - The Base logo has been refreshed! The new logo symbolizes the exciting new possibilities unlocked by the diverse and powerful features of Base.
  - You can select multiple tables as the data source for dashboard blocks, allowing you to combine multiple data sets from different tables to conduct more comprehensive analysis.
  - Dashboard data can be tailored to advanced permissions configured in the base. Visitors will only be able to see the data within their permission scope, providing greater flexibility and data security for users.
  Tasks
  - In complex task scenarios, you can assign a parent task for independent tasks, or promote a subtask to an independent task at any time. This allows you to freely define the hierarchical relationships between tasks, making project management more flexible.
