  Docs
  - Save a version of a document to keep track of important updates. You can save and manage multiple versions, and generate a link for each version to share with others.

  - Hosts can customize the screen layout of meeting recordings to cater to different scenario needs.
  - For more advanced meeting control, hosts can manage participants' permissions to send emoji reactions.
  - Inserted Minutes links can be automatically processed in docs on desktop! You can watch Minutes videos in docs and view the transcripts at the same time.

  Lingo
  - Turn any selected text into a Lingo entry in your document for easier knowledge building.
  - Check the details of underlined Lingo entries in Doc comments with one click.

  Improvements:
  - Animated emojis appear when you use emojis to react to posts in group chats a specific number of times, making communication more fun.
