ReleaseNotes: |-
  New Features
  1. Windowed mode scaling (#1071, #135)
      - Press Alt+Shift+Q to upscale the foreground window in windowed mode. The scaled window can be dragged and resized like a normal window.
      - A toolbar has been added at the top of the scaled window, providing features like FPS display and screenshot capture
  2. Fullscreen scaling now persists when switching foreground windows (#1052)
  3. Improved error reporting with user-friendly messages (#1022)
  4. Minimum FPS threshold support (#1043, #899)
      - Helps maintain stable GPU clock speeds and prevents stuttering due to sudden framerate spikes
  5. GPU change detection support (#1037)
  6. Tray icon menu now supports delayed scaling (#1042, #524)
      - You can now open the main window with a single click on the tray icon, double-click is no longer needed
  7. "New Profile" dialog: "Name" field now supports filling in window title or process name via right-click menu (#1153, #1157)
  8. Shortcut keys now support Tab, Print Screen, and Pause/Break (#1134, #1133)ReleaseNotesUrl: https://github.com/Blinue/Magpie/releases/tag/v0.12.0-preview1
  Effects
  1. FP16 support added (#1049)
      - Significantly improves performance for most ML-based effects
      - FP16-enabled effects include Anime4K family, CuNNy family, FSRCNNX family, ACNet, FSR, NIS, and more
      - Enabled only on GPUs with FP16 support
  2. New CuNNy2 effect family (#1147)
      - An enhanced version of CuNNy, with retrained models for fewer artifacts and sharper lines
      - CuNNy now replaces ACNet as one of the default scaling modes
      - The original CuNNy has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release
      - Homepage: https://github.com/funnyplanter/CuNNy
  3. NIS updated to v1.0.3 (#1049)
  4. CRT_Geom no longer supports interlacing simulation (#1165)
      - Interlacing parameter removed
      - The change is due to the reliance of interlacing on a fixed frame rate, which is incompatible with Magpie’s on-demand rendering model
  Fixes
  1. Fixed missing arguments when using a shortcut as a launcher (#1162, #1158)
  2. Fixed incorrect GPU order in certain cases
  3. Fixed crash when deleting a scaling mode (#1155, #1154)
  4. Fixed crash when opening context menu in text boxes under certain conditions (#1152, #1070)
  5. Fixed error dialog of TouchHelper (#1139, #1135)
  6. Fixed flickering at window edges during resizing (thanks @apkipa) (#1096)
  7. Fixed incorrect position of snap layout popup (thanks @apkipa) (#1034)
  8. Fixed missing "Auto scale" setting when copying a profile (#1065, #1064)
  Other Changes
  1. Default modifier key changed from Win to Alt (#1150, #1136)
      - Win+Shift+A is now reserved by Windows Recall
  2. Increased GPU process priority (#1146)
      - Improves smoothness under heavy system load
  3. Improved long path handling (#960)
      - Magpie itself still doesn’t support being run from a long path
  4. Documentation updates (thanks @mhtvsSFrpHdE) (#1113, #1140)
