ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Reverted GPU Working Mode to the method used previously

  Notes:
  After extensive testing, it turns out that the new, technically better method, of handling GPU Working Mode causes problems on many models and works as expected only on few. Therefore, this update reverts this change to the same state as versions pre-2.15.0. If you were one of the few that preferred the new method, you can still opt-in. Check Arguments section in the README on the project page for more details. I hope this is the end of the GPU Working Mode changes.
