ShortDescription: A user-friendly launcher for Bazel.
Description: Bazelisk is a wrapper for Bazel written in Go. It automatically picks a good version of Bazel given your current working directory, downloads it from the official server (if required) and then transparently passes through all command-line arguments to the real Bazel binary. You can call it just like you would call Bazel.

ReleaseNotes: 'This release brings two small improvements:
 - On Linux, Bazelisk now downloads Bazel binaries built on CentOS 7, thus ensuring compatibility with older Ubuntu versions such as 14.04 and 16.04.
 - Everyone who uses Bazelisk as a library can now dynamically compute Bazel flags based on the resolved Bazel version. (#358). Thank you tjgq!'
