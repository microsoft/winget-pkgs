ShortDescription: A user-friendly launcher for Bazel.
Description: |-
  Bazelisk is a wrapper for Bazel written in Go.
  It automatically picks a good version of Bazel given your current working directory, downloads it from the official server (if required) and then transparently passes through all command-line arguments to the real Bazel binary.
  You can call it just like you would call Bazel.
