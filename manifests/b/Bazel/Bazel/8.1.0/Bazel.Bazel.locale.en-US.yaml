  Release 8.1.0 (2025-02-13)
  Bazel 8.1.0 is a minor LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 8.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.
  General
  - On Linux, the default limit on the number of --watchfs file events per directory has been raised to 10,000 (from 500). If needed, it can be increased further via --host_jvm_args=-Djdk.nio.file.WatchService.maxEventsPerPoll=<limit>. (#24872)
  C++ / Objective-C
  - Added conlyopts and cxxopts to objc_library. (#25022)
  Configurability
  - Changing any part of --run_under that isn't the label (such as the shell command) no longer invalidates the analysis cache. (#25023)
  - The new no_match_error attribute on toolchain_type can be used to show a custom message when no matching toolchain is found for that type, but one is required. (#25178)
  External Dependencies
  - --experimental_downloader_config now supports the ~ character for the home directory. (#24978)
  - Added repository_ctx.original_name, which contains the original value of the name attribute as specified at the repo rule call site. (#25191)
  Remote Execution
  - CAS requests made when Bazel downloads a blob with Build without the Bytes enabled now provide metadata with an action ID of input if the blob is downloaded as the input to a local action and output if it is a requested action output. (#25058)
  Starlark / Build Language
  - Add a set data type to Starlark. (#25111)
