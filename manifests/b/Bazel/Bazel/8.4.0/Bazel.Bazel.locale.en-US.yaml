  Release 8.4.0 (2025-09-04)
  Release Notes:
  Android:
  - Add better defaults for mobile-install flags (#26388)
  Configurability:
  - Added --incompatible_compact_repo_mapping_manifest, which causes the repo mapping manifest file for runfiles to use a more compact format when necessary. (#26420)
  - If a cc toolchain feature named shorten_virtual_includes is enabled, virtual include header files are linked under bin/_virtual_includes/<hash of target path> instead of bin/<target package path>/_virtual_includes/<target name>. This shortens the virtual include paths which is critical for mitigating long path issue with MSVC on Windows. (#26532)
  - The --experimental_cancel_concurrent_tests option now accepts the values on_passed, on_failed and never and cancels concurrent test runs on the first matching result. If enabled, it's now effective by default and no longer requires --test_strategy=standalone to be passed explicitly. (#26670)
  - Tool paths specified in cc_toolchain action configs are now normalized based on the current execution platform's OS rather than the host OS. In particular, Windows-style absolute paths are now treated as absolute paths when building on a Windows executor from a non-Windows host. (#26598)
  - The new --module_mirrors flag accepts a comma-separated list of mirrors to use for source URLs provided by modules obtained from Bazel registries. (#26850)
  ExternalDeps:
  - Modules backed by http_archive or git_repository no longer require a MODULE.bazel file to be contained in the source archive. (#26462)
  OSS:
  - Branches will always be merged as best as possible based on branch and block numbers during coverage report generation. (#26461)
  Rules-CPP:
  - [Incompatible] Bazel releases that include a bundled JDK now use the system trust store for certificates by default. Set -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore and -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStoreType via --host_jvm_args to override the default location. (#26681)
