  Release 8.3.0 (2025-06-23)
  Release Notes:
  ExternalDeps:
  - source.json now supports a new attribute mirror_urls as backup URLs for the source archive. (#25937)
  - repository_ctx.download_and_extract now supports the .whl file extension for Python wheel files, treating them as ZIP archives under PEP 427. (#26323)
  General:
  - User-provided repo names may now start with a number. (#26252)
  Performance:
  - Added the load_wasm and execute_wasm methods to repository_ctx and module_ctx that allow repo rules and module extensions to run a WebAssembly binary. These methods are only available if --experimental_repository_ctx_execute_wasm is set. (#26280)
