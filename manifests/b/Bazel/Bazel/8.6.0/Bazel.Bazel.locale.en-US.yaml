ReleaseNotes: |-
  Release 8.6.0 (2026-02-26)
  Release Notes:
  Configurability:
  - Reporting of cached test results can now be suppressed with --test_summary=short_uncached or --test_summary=detailed_uncached. (#28343)
  - ctx.actions.symlink now accepts a target_type argument. (#28538)
  ExternalDeps:
  - Bazel now fails over immediately to mirror URLs if a TLS handshake error occurs. (#28459)
  - The compatibility_level and max_compatibility_level attributes of module in MODULE.bazel are now no-ops. Module maintainers should stop specifying those attributes and provide clear build time error messages and actionable migration paths when making major breaking changes. (#28615)
