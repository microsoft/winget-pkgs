  2.3.13
  Patch Changes
  - #8815 f924f23 Thanks @dyc3! - Improved useVueValidVOn to be more closely aligned with the source rule. It will now properly allow modifiers for all possible keyboard events. It should have better performance when there are no violations of the rule as well.
    Now treated valid:
    <div @keydown.arrow-down="handler"></div>
    <div @keydown.a="handler"></div>
    <div @keydown.b="handler"></div>
    <div @keydown.27="foo"></div>
  - #8856 85f81f9 Thanks @dyc3! - Fixed #8710: Biome now parses Vue dynamic slot shorthand arguments that use template literals in [].
  - #8850 2a190e0 Thanks @dyc3! - Fixed #8708: Tailwind @utility directives now parse functional utility names like px-* when Tailwind directives are enabled.
  - #8863 79386e0 Thanks @dyc3! - Fixed an issue with biome migrate eslint where it couldn't detect rules for CSS, GraphQL, and HTML.
  - #8771 6f56b6e Thanks @lghuahua! - Fix the --reporter=summary output incorrectly merging and displaying wrong issue counts for different rules. Fixes #8730
  - #8714 ac3a71f Thanks @Netail! - Added new nursery rule use-consistent-enum-value-type. This rule disallows enums from having both number and string members.
