  2.3.5
  Patch Changes
  - #8023 96f3e77 Thanks @ematipico! - Added support Svelte syntax {@html}. Biome now is able to parse and format the Svelte syntax {@html}:
    -{@html   'div'}
    +{@html 'div'}
    The contents of the expressions inside the {@html <expression>} aren't formatted yet.
  - #8058 5f68bcc Thanks @ematipico! - Fixed a bug where the Biome Language Server would enable its project file watcher even when no project rules were enabled.
    Now the watching of nested configuration files and nested ignore files is delegated to the editor, if their LSP spec supports it.
  - #8023 96f3e77 Thanks @ematipico! - Added support Svelte syntax {@render}. Biome now is able to parse and format the Svelte syntax {@render}:
    -{@render   sum(1, 2)   }
    +{@render sum(1, 2)}
    The contents of the expressions inside the {@render <expression>} aren't formatted yet.
  - #8006 f0612a5 Thanks @Bertie690! - Updated documentation and diagnostic for lint/complexity/noBannedTypes. The rule should have a more detailed description and diagnostic error message.
  - #8039 da70d8b Thanks @PFiS1737! - Biome now keeps a blank line after the frontmatter section in Astro files.
  - #8042 b7efa6f Thanks @dyc3! - The CSS Parser, with tailwindDirectives enabled, will now accept at rules like @media and @supports in @custom-variant shorthand syntax.
  - #8064 3ff9d45 Thanks @dibashthapa! - Fixed #7967: Fixed the issue with support for advanced SVG props
  - #8023 96f3e77 Thanks @ematipico! - Added support Svelte syntax {@attach}. Biome now is able to parse and format the Svelte syntax {@attach}:
    -<div {@attach    myAttachment   }>...</div>
    +<div {@attach myAttachment}>...</div>
    The contents of the expressions inside the {@attach <expression>} aren't formatted yet.
  - #8001 6e8a50e Thanks @ematipico! - Added support Svelte syntax {#key}. Biome now is able to parse and format the Svelte syntax {#key}:
    -{#key   expression} <div></div> {/key}
    +{#key expression}
    +  <div></div>
    +{/key}
    The contents of the expressions inside the {#key <expression>} aren't formatted yet.
  - #8023 96f3e77 Thanks @ematipico! - Added support Svelte syntax {@const}. Biome now is able to parse and format the Svelte syntax {@const}:
    -{@const   name = value}
    +{@const name = value}
    The contents of the expressions inside the {@const <expression>} aren't formatted yet.
  - #8044 8f77d4a Thanks @Netail! - Corrected rule source references. biome migrate eslint should do a bit better detecting rules in your eslint configurations.
  - #8065 1a2d1af Thanks @Netail! - Added the nursery rule useArraySortCompare. Require Array#sort and Array#toSorted calls to always provide a compareFunction.
    Invalid:
    const array = [];
    array.sort();
    Valid:
    const array = [];
    array.sort((a, b) => a - b);
  - #7673 a3a713d Thanks @dyc3! - The HTML parser is now able to parse vue directives. This enables us to write/port Vue lint rules that require inspecting the <template> section. However, this more complex parsing may result in parsing errors where there was none before. For those of you that have opted in to the experimental support (aka experimentalFullSupportEnabled), we greatly appreciate your help testing this out, and your bug reports.
  - #8031 fa6798a Thanks @ematipico! - Added support for the Svelte syntax {#if}{/if}. The Biome HTML parser is now able to parse and format the {#if}{/if} blocks:
    <!-- if / else-if / else -->
    {#if porridge.temperature > 100}
    -<p>too hot!</p>
    +  <p>too hot!</p>
    {:else if 80 > porridge.temperature}
    -<p>too cold!</p>
    +  <p>too cold!</p>
    {:else if 100 > porridge.temperature}
    -<p>too too cold!</p>
    +  <p>too too cold!</p>
    {:else}
    -<p>just right!</p>
    +  <p>just right!</p>
    {/if}
  - #8041 beeb7bb Thanks @dyc3! - The CSS parser, with tailwindDirectives enabled, will now accept lists of selectors in @custom-variant shorthand syntax.
    @custom-variant cell (th:has(&), td:has(&));
  - #8028 c09e45c Thanks @fmajestic! - The GitLab reporter now outputs format errors.
  - #8037 78011b1 Thanks @PFiS1737! - indentScriptAndStyle no longer indents the frontmatter in Astro files.
  - #8009 6374b1f Thanks @tmcw! - Fixed an edge case in the useArrowFunction rule.
    The rule no longer emits diagnostics for or offers to fix functions that reference
    the arguments object,
    because that object is undefined for arrow functions.
    Valid example:
    // Valid: this function cannot be transformed into an arrow function because
    // arguments is not defined for arrow functions.
    const getFirstArg = function () {
      return arguments[0];
    };
