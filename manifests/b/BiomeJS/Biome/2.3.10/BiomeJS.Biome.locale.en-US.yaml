  Patch Changes
  - #8417 c3a2557 Thanks @taga3s! - Fixed #7809: noRedeclare no longer reports redeclarations for infer type in conditional types.
  - #8477 90e8684 Thanks @dyc3! - Fixed #8475: fixed a regression in how noExtraNonNullAssertion flags extra non-null assertions
  - #8479 250b519 Thanks @dyc3! - Fixed #8473: The semantic model now indexes typescript constructor method definitions, and no longer panics if you use one (a regression in 2.3.9).
  - #8448 2af85c1 Thanks @mdevils! - Improved handling of defineProps() macro in Vue components. The noVueReservedKeys rule now avoids false positives in non-setup scripts.
  - #8420 42033b0 Thanks @vsn4ik! - Fixed the nursery rule noLeakedRender.
    The biome migrate eslint command now correctly detects the rule react/jsx-no-leaked-render in your eslint configurations.
  - #8426 285d932 Thanks @anthonyshew! - Added a Turborepo domain and a new "noUndeclaredEnvVars" rule in it for warning users of unsafe environment variable usage in Turborepos.
  - #8410 a21db74 Thanks @ematipico! - Fixed #2988 where Biome couldn't handle properly characters that contain multiple code points when running in stdin mode.
  - #8372 b352ee4 Thanks @Netail! - Added the nursery rule noAmbiguousAnchorText, which disallows ambiguous anchor descriptions.
