  2.3.8
  Patch Changes
  - #8188 4ca088c Thanks @ematipico! - Fixed #7390, where Biome couldn't apply the correct configuration passed via --config-path.
    If you have multiple root configuration files, running any command with --config-path will now apply the chosen configuration file.
  - #8171 79adaea Thanks @dibashthapa! - Added the new rule noLeakedRender. This rule helps prevent potential leaks when rendering components that use binary expressions or ternaries.
    For example, the following code triggers the rule because the component would render 0:
    const Component = () => {
      const count = 0;
      return <div>{count && <span>Count: {count}</span>}</div>;
    };
  - #8116 b537918 Thanks @Netail! - Added the nursery rule noDuplicatedSpreadProps. Disallow JSX prop spreading the same identifier multiple times.
    Invalid:
    <div {...props} something="else" {...props} />
  - #8256 f1e4696 Thanks @cormacrelf! - Fixed a bug where logs were discarded (the kind from --log-level=info etc.). This is a regression introduced after an internal refactor that wasn't adequately tested.
  - #8226 3f19b52 Thanks @dyc3! - Fixed #8222: The HTML parser, with Vue directives enabled, can now parse v-slot shorthand syntax, e.g. <template #foo>.
  - #8007 182ecdc Thanks @brandonmcconnell! - Added support for dollar-sign-prefixed filenames in the useFilenamingConvention rule.
    Biome now allows filenames starting with the dollar-sign (e.g. $postId.tsx) by default to support naming conventions used by frameworks such as TanStack Start for file-based-routing.
  - #8218 91484d1 Thanks @hirokiokada77! - Added the noMultiStr rule, which disallows creating multiline strings by escaping newlines.
    Invalid:
    const foo =
      "Line 1\n\
    Line 2";
    Valid:
    const foo = "Line 1\nLine 2";
    const bar = `Line 1
    Line 2`;
  - #8225 98ca2ae Thanks @ongyuxing! - Fixed #7806: Prefer breaking after the assignment operator for conditional types with generic parameters to match Prettier.
    -type True = unknown extends Type<
    -  "many",
    -  "generic",
    -  "parameters",
    -  "one",
    -  "two",
    -  "three"
    ->
    -  ? true
    -  : false;
    +type True =
    +  unknown extends Type<"many", "generic", "parameters", "one", "two", "three">
    +    ? true
    +    : false;
  - #6765 23f7855 Thanks @emilyinure! - Fixed #6569: Allow files to export from themselves with noImportCycles.
    This means the following is now allowed:
    // example.js
    export function example() {
      return 1;
    }
    // Re-exports all named exports from the current module under a single namespace
    // and then imports the namespace from the current module.
    // Allows for encapsulating functions/variables into a namespace instead
    // of using a static class.
    export * as Example from "./example.js";
    import { Example } from "./example.js";
  - #8214 68c052e Thanks @hirokiokada77! - Added the noEqualsToNull rule, which enforces the use of === and !== for comparison with null instead of == or !=.
    Invalid:
    foo == null;
    foo != null;
    Valid:
    foo === null;
    foo !== null;
  - #8219 793bb9a Thanks @dyc3! - Fixed #8190: The HTML parser will now parse Vue event handlers that contain : correctly, e.g. @update:modelValue="onUpdate".
  - #8259 4a9139b Thanks @hirokiokada77! - Fixed #8254: The noParameterAssign rule with propertyAssignment: "deny" was incorrectly reporting an error when a function parameter was used on the right-hand side of an assignment to a local variable's property.
    The rule should only flag assignments that modify the parameter binding or its properties (L-value), not the use of its value.
    Valid:
    (input) => {
      const local = { property: 0 };
      local.property = input;
    };
  - #8201 cd2edd7 Thanks @Netail! - Added the nursery rule noTernary. Disallow ternary operators.
    Invalid:
    const foo = isBar ? baz : qux;
  - #8172 de98933 Thanks @JeremyMoeglich! - Fixed #8145: handling of large hex literals, which previously caused both false positives and false negatives.
    This affects noPrecisionLoss and noConstantMathMinMaxClamp.
  - #8210 7b44e9e Thanks @Netail! - Corrected rule source reference. biome migrate eslint should do a bit better detecting rules in your eslint configurations.
  - #8213 e430555 Thanks @ruidosujeira! - Fixed #8209: Recognized formatting capability when either range or on-type formatting is supported, not only full-file formatting. This ensures editors and the language server correctly detect formatting support in files like JSONC.
  - #8202 6f49d95 Thanks @hirokiokada77! - Fixed #8079: Properly handle name and value metavariables for JsxAttribute GritQL queries.
    The following biome search command no longer throws an error:
    biome search 'JsxAttribute($name, $value) as $attr where { $name <: "style" }'
  - #8276 f7e836f Thanks @hirokiokada77! - Added the noProto rule, which disallows the use of the __proto__ property for getting or setting the prototype of an object.
    Invalid:
    obj.__proto__ = a;
    const b = obj.__proto__;
    Valid:
    const a = Object.getPrototypeOf(obj);
    Object.setPrototypeOf(obj, b);
