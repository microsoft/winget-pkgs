  2.4.2
  Patch Changes
  - #9103 fc9850c Thanks @dyc3! - Fixed #9098: useImportType no longer incorrectly flags imports used in Svelte control flow blocks ({#if}, {#each}, {#await}, {#key}) as type-only imports.
  - #9106 f4b7296 Thanks @dyc3! - Updated rule source metadata for rules from html-eslint.
  - #8960 4a5ff40 Thanks @abossenbroek! - Added the nursery rule noConditionalExpect. This rule disallows conditional expect() calls inside tests, which can lead to tests that silently pass when assertions never run.
    // Invalid - conditional expect may not run
    test("conditional", async ({ page }) => {
      if (someCondition) {
        await expect(page).toHaveTitle("Title");
      }
    });
    // Valid - unconditional expect
    test("unconditional", async ({ page }) => {
      await expect(page).toHaveTitle("Title");
    });
  - #8960 4a5ff40 Thanks @abossenbroek! - Added the nursery rule noPlaywrightElementHandle. Prefers locators to element handles.
    const el = await page.$(".btn");
  - #8960 4a5ff40 Thanks @abossenbroek! - Added the nursery rule noPlaywrightEval. Disallows page.$eval() and page.$$eval() methods.
    await page.$eval(".btn", (el) => el.textContent);
  - #8960 4a5ff40 Thanks @abossenbroek! - Added the nursery rule noPlaywrightForceOption. Disallows the force option on user interactions.
    await locator.click({ force: true });
  - #8960 4a5ff40 Thanks @abossenbroek! - Added the nursery rule noPlaywrightMissingAwait. Enforces awaiting async Playwright APIs.
    const el = page.locator(".btn");
    el.click(); // Missing await
  - #8960 4a5ff40 Thanks @abossenbroek! - Added the nursery rule noPlaywrightNetworkidle. Disallows deprecated networkidle wait option.
    await page.goto(url, { waitUntil: "networkidle" });
  - #8960 4a5ff40 Thanks @abossenbroek! - Added the nursery rule noPlaywrightPagePause. Disallows page.pause() debugging calls in committed code.
    await page.pause();
  - #8960 4a5ff40 Thanks @abossenbroek! - Added the nursery rule noPlaywrightUselessAwait. Disallows unnecessary await on synchronous Playwright methods.
    // Incorrect - locator() is synchronous
    const loc = await page.locator(".btn");
  - #8960 4a5ff40 Thanks @abossenbroek! - Added the nursery rule noPlaywrightWaitForNavigation. Prefers modern navigation APIs over deprecated waitForNavigation().
    await page.waitForNavigation();
  - #8960 4a5ff40 Thanks @abossenbroek! - Added the nursery rule noPlaywrightWaitForSelector. Prefers locators over deprecated waitForSelector().
    await page.waitForSelector(".btn");
  - #8960 4a5ff40 Thanks @abossenbroek! - Added the nursery rule noPlaywrightWaitForTimeout. Disallows hard-coded timeouts with waitForTimeout().
    await page.waitForTimeout(5000);
  - #8960 4a5ff40 Thanks @abossenbroek! - Enhanced noSkippedTests to detect Playwright patterns (.fixme, test.describe, test.step, bracket notation, bare calls). Consolidated noPlaywrightSkippedTest into this rule.
  - #9101 0c0fb6f Thanks @siketyan! - Fixed #9080: The noUnusedVariables rule no longer reports a top-level Props interface or type alias as unused in Astro files.
  - #8960 4a5ff40 Thanks @abossenbroek! - Added the nursery rule useExpect. This rule ensures that test functions contain at least one expect() assertion.
    // Invalid - test without assertion
    test("no assertion", async ({ page }) => {
      await page.goto("/");
    });
    // Valid - test with assertion
    test("has assertion", async ({ page }) => {
      await expect(page).toHaveTitle("Title");
    });
  - #8960 4a5ff40 Thanks @abossenbroek! - Added the nursery rule usePlaywrightValidDescribeCallback. Validates that describe callback signatures are not async.
    test.describe("suite", async () => {});
