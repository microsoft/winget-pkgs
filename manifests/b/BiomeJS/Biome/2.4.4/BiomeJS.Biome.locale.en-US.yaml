  2.4.4
  Patch Changes
  - #9150 6946835 Thanks @dyc3! - Fixed #9138: Astro files containing --- in HTML content (e.g., <h1>---Hi</h1>) are now parsed correctly, both when a frontmatter block is present and when there is no frontmatter at all.
  - #9150 aa6f837 Thanks @dyc3! - Fixed #9138: The HTML parser incorrectly failing to parse bracket characters ([ and ]) in text content (e.g. <div>[Foo]</div>).
  - #9151 c0d4b0c Thanks @dyc3! - Fixed parsing of Svelte directive keywords (use, style) when used as plain text content in HTML/Svelte files. Previously, <p>use JavaScript</p> or <p>style it</p> would incorrectly produce a bogus element instead of proper text content.
  - #9162 7f1e060 Thanks @dyc3! - Fixed #9161: The Vue parser now correctly handles colon attributes like xlink:href and xmlns:xlink by parsing them as single attributes instead of splitting them into separate tokens.
  - #9164 458211b Thanks @dyc3! - Fixed #9161: The noAssignInExpressions rule no longer flags assignments in Vue v-on directives (e.g., @click="counter += 1"). Assignments in event handlers are idiomatic Vue patterns and are now skipped by the rule.
