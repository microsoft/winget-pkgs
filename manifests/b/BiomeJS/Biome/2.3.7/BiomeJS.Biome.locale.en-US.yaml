  2.3.7
  Patch Changes
  - #8169 7fdcec8 Thanks @arendjr! - Fixed #7999: Correctly place await after leading comment in auto-fix action from noFloatingPromises rule.
  - #8157 12d5b42 Thanks @Conaclos! - Fixed #8148. noInvalidUseBeforeDeclaration no longer reports some valid use before declarations.
    The following code is no longer reported as invalid:
    class classA {
      C = C;
    }
    const C = 0;
  - #8178 6ba4157 Thanks @dyc3! - Fixed #8174, where the HTML parser would parse 2 directives as a single directive because it would not reject whitespace in Vue directives. This would cause the formatter to erroneously merge the 2 directives into one, resulting in broken code.
    - <Component v-else:property="123" />
    + <Component v-else :property="123" />
  - #8088 0eb08e8 Thanks @db295! - Fixed #7876: The noUnusedImports rule now ignores imports that are used by @linkcode and @linkplain (previously supported @link and @see).
    The following code will no longer be a false positive:
    import type { a } from "a"
    /**
     * {@linkcode a}
     */
    function func() {}
  - #8119 8d64655 Thanks @ematipico! - Improved the detection of the rule noUnnecessaryConditions. Now the rule isn't triggered for variables that are mutated inside a module.
    This logic deviates from the original rule, hence noUnnecessaryConditions is now marked as "inspired".
    In the following example, hey starts as false, but then it's assigned to a string. The rule isn't triggered inside the if check.
    let hey = false;
    function test() {
      hey = "string";
    }
    if (hey) {
    }
  - #8149 e0a02bf Thanks @Netail! - Fixed #8144: Improve noSyncScripts, ignore script tags with type="module" as these are always non-blocking.
  - #8182 e9f068e Thanks @hirokiokada77! - Fixed #7877: Range suppressions now handle suppressed categories properly.
    Valid:
    // biome-ignore-start lint: explanation
    const foo = 1;
    // biome-ignore-end lint: explanation
  - #8111 bf1a836 Thanks @ryan-m-walker! - Added support for parsing and formatting the CSS if function.
    Example
    .basic-style {
      color: if(style(--scheme: dark): #eeeeee; else: #000000;);
    }
  - #8173 7fc07c1 Thanks @ematipico! - Fixed #8138 by reverting an internal refactor that caused a regression to the rule noUnusedPrivateClassMembers.
  - #8119 8d64655 Thanks @ematipico! - Improved the type inference engine, by resolving types for variables that are assigned to multiple values.
  - #8158 fb1458b Thanks @dyc3! - Added the useVueValidVText lint rule to enforce valid v-text directives. The rule reports when v-text has an argument, has modifiers, or is missing a value.
    Invalid:
    <div v-text />
    <!-- missing value -->
    <div v-text:aaa="foo" />
    <!-- has argument -->
    <div v-text.bbb="foo" />
    <!-- has modifier -->
  - #8158 fb1458b Thanks @dyc3! - Fixed useVueValidVHtml so that it will now flag empty strings, e.g. v-html=""
  - #7078 bb7a15c Thanks @emilyinure! - Fixed #6675: Now only flags
    noAccumulatingSpread on Object.assign when a new object is being allocated on
    each iteration. Before, all cases using Object.assign with reduce parameters
    were warned despite not making new allocations.
    The following code will no longer be a false positive:
    foo.reduce((acc, bar) => Object.assign(acc, bar), {});
    The following cases which do make new allocations will continue to warn:
    foo.reduce((acc, bar) => Object.assign({}, acc, bar), {});
  - #8175 0c8349e Thanks @ryan-m-walker! - Fixed CSS formatting of dimension units to use correct casing for Q, Hz and kHz.
    Before:
    .cssUnits {
      a: 1Q;
      b: 1Hz;
      c: 1kHz;
    }
    After:
    .cssUnits {
      a: 1Q;
      b: 1Hz;
      c: 1kHz;
    }
