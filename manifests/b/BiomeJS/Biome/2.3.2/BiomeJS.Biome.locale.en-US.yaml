  2.3.2
  Patch Changes
  - #7859 c600618 Thanks @Netail! - Added the nursery rule noIncrementDecrement, disallows the usage of the unary operators ++ and --.
  - #7901 0d17b05 Thanks @ematipico! - Fixed #7837, where Biome couldn't properly parse text expressions that contained nested curly brackets. This was breaking parsing in Astro and Svelte files.
  - #7874 e617d36 Thanks @Bertie690! - Fixed #7230: noUselessStringConcat no longer emits false positives for multi-line strings with leading + operators.
    Previously, the rule did not check for leading newlines on the + operator, emitting false positives if one occurred at the start of a line.
    Notably, formatting with operatorLinebreak="before" would move the + operators to the start of lines automatically, resulting in spurious errors whenever a multi-line string was used.
    Now, the rule correctly detects and ignores multi-line concatenations with leading operators as well, working regardless of the setting of operatorLinebreak.
    Example
    // The following code used to error if the `+` operators were at the start of lines (as opposed to the end).
    // Now, the rule correctly recognizes this as a stylistic concatenation and ignores it.
    const reallyLongStringThatShouldNotError =
      "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipiscing elit." +
      "Quisque faucibus ex sapien vitae pellentesque sem placerat." +
      "In id cursus mi pretium tellus duis convallis." +
      "Tempus leo eu aenean sed diam urna tempor. Pulvinar vivamus fringilla";
  - #7786 33ffcd5 Thanks @daivinhtran! - Fixed #7601: Properly match Grit plugin's code snippet with only one child.
  - #7901 0d17b05 Thanks @ematipico! - Fixed #7837, where Biome Language Server panicked when opening HTML-ish files when the experimental full support is enabled.
