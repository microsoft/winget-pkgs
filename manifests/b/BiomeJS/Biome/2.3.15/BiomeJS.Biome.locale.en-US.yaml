ReleaseNotes: |-
  2.3.15
  Patch Changes
  - #9019 043b67c Thanks @dyc3! - Added the lint rule noNestedPromises. This rule detects nested .then() or .catch() calls that could be refactored into flat promise chains.
    // Invalid: nested promise that can be flattened
    doThing().then(function () {
      return doOtherThing().then(console.log);
    });
    // Valid: flat promise chain
    doThing()
      .then(() => doOtherThing())
      .then(console.log);
    The rule intelligently allows nesting when the inner callback references variables from the outer scope, as these cases cannot be safely flattened.
  - #9029 6ebf6c6 Thanks @ff1451! - Added the nursery rule noUselessReturn. The rule reports redundant return; statements that don't affect the function's control flow.
    // Invalid: return at end of function is redundant
    function foo() {
      doSomething();
      return;
    }
  - #9017 8bac2da Thanks @mdevils! - Reverted a behavior change in useExhaustiveDependencies that was accidentally included as part of the #8802 fix. The change made method calls on objects (e.g., props.data.forEach(...)) report only the object (props.data) as a missing dependency instead of the full member expression. This behavior change will be reconsidered separately.
  - #9005 c8dbbbe Thanks @corvid-agent! - Fixed #8790: The noAssignInExpressions rule no longer reports a false positive when an assignment is used as the expression body of an arrow function (e.g., const f = b => a += b).
  - #8519 ccdc602 Thanks @ruidosujeira! - Fixed #8518, where globally excluded files in a monorepo were still being processed when using "extends": "//".
    When a package-level configuration extends the root configuration with "extends": "//", glob patterns (such as those in files.includes) are now correctly resolved relative to the project root directory, instead of the current workspace directory.
  - #9033 0628e0a Thanks @mdevils! - Fixed #8967. useExhaustiveDependencies no longer reports false positives for variables destructured from a rest pattern.
  - #9023 8ef9d1d Thanks @siketyan! - Fixed #9020: When javascript.jsxRuntime is set to reactClassic, noUnusedImports and useImportType rules now allow importing the React identifier from a package other than react. This aligns the behavior with tsc (--jsx=react), which also allows importing React from any package.
  - #8646 16fd71d Thanks @siketyan! - Fixed #8605: Text expressions in some template languages ({{ expr }} or { expr }) at the top level of an HTML document no longer causes panicking.
  - #8930 51c158e Thanks @ANKANJAGTAP! - Fixed #8917
    useExhaustiveDependencies now correctly detects JSX component identifiers as hook dependencies.
  - #9009 7d229c7 Thanks @Netail! - Fixed typo in noPositiveTabindex's quick fix text.
  - #8758 8c789f1 Thanks @Pranav2612000! - Updated the useJsxKeyInIterable rule to not run inside Map constructors
  - #8977 bbe0e0c Thanks @FrankFMY! - Fixed #4888.
    noUnusedImports now adds export {} when removing the last import in a TypeScript file to prevent it from becoming an ambient module. This does not apply to embedded scripts in Vue, Svelte, or Astro files, which are already in a module context.
  - #9016 9d4cfa3 Thanks @dyc3! - Added eslint migration metadata for the rules @typescript/no-var-requires, @typescript/keyword-spacing, @typescript/func-call-spacing, vue/keyword-spacing, vue/func-call-spacing, and unicorn/empty-brace-spaces,
  - #8848 2cba2b3 Thanks @LouisLau-art! - Fixed #8845. Now useGenericFontNames doesn't trigger when font is declared inside the @supports at-rule.
  - #8997 a5f3212 Thanks @mldangelo! - Fixed #8476.
    useAwaitThenable no longer reports false positives for await on call expressions whose return type cannot be resolved (e.g., cross-module function calls to Node.js builtins or npm packages).
  - #8978 cc7a478 Thanks @FrankFMY! - Fixed #8645.
    useAwait no longer reports async generator functions that use yield*, since yield* in an async generator delegates to an AsyncIterable and requires the async modifier.
