  Patch Changes
  - #9120 aa40fc2 Thanks @ematipico! - Fixed #9109, where the GitHub reporter wasn't correctly enabled when biome ci runs on GitHub Actions.
  - #9128 8ca3f7f Thanks @dyc3! - Fixed #9107: The HTML parser can now correctly parse Astro directives (client/set/class/is/server), which fixes the formatting for Astro directives.
  - #9124 f5b0e8d Thanks @ematipico! - Fixed #8882 and #9108: The Astro frontmatter lexer now correctly identifies the closing --- fence when the frontmatter contains multi-line block comments with quote characters, strings that mix quote types (e.g. "it's"), or escaped quote characters (e.g. "\").
  - #9142 3ca066b Thanks @THernandez03! - Fixed #9141: The noUnknownAttribute rule no longer reports closedby as an unknown attribute on <dialog> elements.
  - #9126 792013e Thanks @ematipico! - Added missing Mocha globals to the Test domain: context, run, setup, specify, suite, suiteSetup, suiteTeardown, teardown, xcontext, xdescribe, xit, and xspecify. These are injected by Mocha's BDD and TDD interfaces and were previously flagged as undeclared variables in projects using Mocha.
  - #8855 6918c9e Thanks @ruidosujeira! - Fixed #8840. Now the Biome CSS parser correctly parses not + scroll-state inside @container queries.
  - #9111 4fb55cf Thanks @Jayllyz! - Slightly improved performance of noIrregularWhitespace by adding early return optimization and simplifying character detection logic.
  - #8975 086a0c5 Thanks @FrankFMY! - Fixed #8478: useDestructuring no longer suggests destructuring when the variable has a type annotation, like const foo: string = object.foo.
