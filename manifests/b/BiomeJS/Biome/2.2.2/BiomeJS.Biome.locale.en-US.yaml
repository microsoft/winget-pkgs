ReleaseNotes: |-
  2.2.2
  Patch Changes
  - #7266 b270bb5 Thanks @ematipico! - Fixed an issue where Biome got stuck when analyzing some files. This is usually caused by a bug in the inference engine. Now Biome has some guards in place in case the number of types grows too much, and if that happens, a diagnostic is emitted and the inference is halted.
  - #7281 6436180 Thanks @ematipico! - Fixed an issue where the function scanProject wouldn't work as expected.
  - #7285 1511d0c Thanks @rriski! - Partially fixed #6782: JSX node kinds are now supported in GritQL AST nodes.
  - #7249 dff85c0 Thanks @ematipico! - Fixed #748, where Biome Language Server didn't show the unsafe fixes when requesting the quick fixes. Now all LSP editors will show also opt-in, unsafe fixes.
  - #7266 b270bb5 Thanks @ematipico! - Fixed #7020: Resolved an issue with analysing types of static member expressions involving unions. If the object type was a union that referenced nested unions, it would trigger an infinite loop as it tried to keep expanding nested unions, and the set of types would grow indefinitely.
  - #7209 679b70e Thanks @patrickshipe! - Resolved an overcorrection in useImportExtensions when importing explicit index files.
    Imports that explicitly reference an index file are now preserved and no longer rewritten to nested index paths.
    Example
    // Before
    -      import "./sub/index";
    +      import "./sub/index/index.js";
    // After
    -      import "./sub/index";
    +      import "./sub/index.js";
  - #7270 953f9c6 Thanks @arendjr! - Fixed #6172: Resolved an issue with inferring types for rest parameters. This issue caused rest-parameter types to be incorrect, and in some cases caused extreme performance regressions in files that contained many methods with rest-parameter definitions.
  - #7234 b7aa111 Thanks @JeetuSuthar! - Fixed #7233: The useIndexOf rule now correctly suggests using indexOf() instead of findIndex().
    The diagnostic message was incorrectly recommending Array#findIndex() over Array#indexOf(), when it should recommend the opposite for simple equality checks.
  - #7283 0b07f45 Thanks @ematipico! - Fixed #7236. Now Biome correctly migrates JSONC configuration files when they are passed using --config-path.
  - #7239 1d643d8 Thanks @minht11! - Fixed an issue where Svelte globals ($state and so on) were not properly recognized inside .svelte.test.ts/js and .svelte.spec.ts/js files.
  - #7264 62fdbc8 Thanks @ematipico! - Fixed a regression where when using --log-kind-pretty wasn't working anymore as expected.
  - #7244 660031b Thanks @JeetuSuthar! - Fixed #7225: The noExtraBooleanCast rule now preserves parentheses when removing Boolean calls inside negations.
    // Before
    !Boolean(b0 && b1);
    // After
    !(b0 && b1); // instead of !b0 && b1
  - #7298 46a8e93 Thanks @unvalley! - Fixed #6695: useNamingConvention now correctly reports TypeScript parameter properties with modifiers.
    Previously, constructor parameter properties with modifiers like private or readonly were not checked against naming conventions. These properties are now treated consistently with regular class properties.
