  - #9091 3bf674d Thanks @ematipico! - Fixed #9090, where SCSS files were incorrectly processed by Biome. This was a regressions caused by the latest developments for supporting SCSS out of the box.
  - #9100 66931a8 Thanks @siketyan! - Fixed #9081: The noUnknownPseudoElement rule no longer reports false positives for any known pseudo elements in CSS modules. This was a regression introduced in v2.4.0.
  - #9102 d01b903 Thanks @ematipico! - Fixed #9095, where Biome didn't print anything in stdin mode. This was a regression caused by a recent, internal refactor.
