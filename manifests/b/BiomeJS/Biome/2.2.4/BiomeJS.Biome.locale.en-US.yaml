  2.2.4
  Patch Changes
  - #7453 aa8cea3 Thanks @arendjr! - Fixed #7242: Aliases specified in package.json's imports section now support having multiple targets as part of an array.
  - #7454 ac17183 Thanks @arendjr! - Greatly improved performance of noImportCycles by eliminating allocations.
    In one repository, the total runtime of Biome with only noImportCycles enabled went from ~23s down to ~4s.
  - #7447 7139aad Thanks @rriski! - Fixes #7446. The GritQL $... spread metavariable now correctly matches members in object literals, aligning its behavior with arrays and function calls.
  - #6710 98cf9af Thanks @arendjr! - Fixed #4723: Type inference now recognises index signatures and their accesses when they are being indexed as a string.
    Example
    type BagOfPromises = {
      // This is an index signature definition. It declares that instances of type
      // `BagOfPromises` can be indexed using arbitrary strings.
      [property: string]: Promise<void>;
    };
    let bag: BagOfPromises = {};
    // Because `bag.iAmAPromise` is equivalent to `bag["iAmAPromise"]`, this is
    // considered an access to the string index, and a Promise is expected.
    bag.iAmAPromise;
  - 351bccd Thanks @ematipico! - Fixed #7212, now the useOptionalChain rule recognizes optional chaining using typeof (e.g., typeof foo !== 'undefined' && foo.bar).
  - 351bccd Thanks @ematipico! - Fixed #7323. noUnusedPrivateClassMembers no longer reports as unused TypeScript private members if the rule encounters a computed access on this.
    In the following example, member as previously reported as unused.
    It is no longer reported.
    class TsBioo {
      private member: number;
      set_with_name(name: string, value: number) {
        this[name] = value;
      }
    }
  - 351bccd Thanks @ematipico! - Added the new nursery lint rule noJsxLiterals, which disallows the use of string literals inside JSX.
    The rule catches these cases:
    <>
      <div>test</div> {/* test is invalid */}
      <>test</>
      <div>
        {/* this string is invalid */}
        asdjfl test foo
      </div>
    </>
  - 351bccd Thanks @ematipico! - Fixed an issue (#6393) where the useHookAtTopLevel rule reported excessive diagnostics for nested hook calls.
    The rule now reports only the offending top-level call site, not sub-hooks of composite hooks.
    // Before: reported twice (useFoo and useBar).
    function useFoo() {
      return useBar();
    }
    function Component() {
      if (cond) useFoo();
    }
    // After: reported once at the call to useFoo().
  - #7461 ea585a9 Thanks @arendjr! - Improved performance of noPrivateImports by eliminating allocations.
    In one repository, the total runtime of Biome with only noPrivateImports enabled went from ~3.2s down to ~1.4s.
  - 351bccd Thanks @ematipico! - Fixed #7411. The Biome Language Server had a regression where opening an editor with a file already open wouldn't load the project settings correctly.
  - 351bccd Thanks @ematipico! - Added the new nursery rule noDuplicateDependencies, which verifies that no dependencies are duplicated between the bundledDependencies, bundleDependencies, dependencies, devDependencies, overrides, optionalDependencies, and peerDependencies sections.
    For example, the following snippets will trigger the rule:
    {
      "dependencies": {
        "foo": ""
      },
      "devDependencies": {
        "foo": ""
      }
    }
    {
      "dependencies": {
        "foo": ""
      },
      "optionalDependencies": {
        "foo": ""
      }
    }
    {
      "dependencies": {
        "foo": ""
      },
      "peerDependencies": {
        "foo": ""
      }
    }
  - 351bccd Thanks @ematipico! - Fixed #3824. Now the option CLI --color is correctly applied to logging too.
