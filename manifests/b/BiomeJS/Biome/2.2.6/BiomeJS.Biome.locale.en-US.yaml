ReleaseNotes: |-
  2.2.6
  Patch Changes
  - #7071 a8e7301 Thanks @ptkagori! - Added the useQwikMethodUsage lint rule for the Qwik domain.
    This rule validates Qwik hook usage. Identifiers matching useXxx must be called only within serialisable reactive contexts (for example, inside component$, route loaders/actions, or within other Qwik hooks), preventing common Qwik antipatterns.
    Invalid:
    // Top-level hook call is invalid.
    const state = useStore({ count: 0 });
    function helper() {
      // Calling a hook in a non-reactive function is invalid.
      const loc = useLocation();
    }
    Valid:
    component$(() => {
      const state = useStore({ count: 0 }); // OK inside component$.
      return <div>{state.count}</div>;
    });
    const handler = $(() => {
      const loc = useLocation(); // OK inside a $-wrapped closure.
      console.log(loc.params);
    });
  - #7685 52071f5 Thanks @denbezrukov! - Fixed #6981: The NoUnknownPseudoClass rule no longer reports local pseudo-classes when CSS Modules are used.
  - #7640 899f7b2 Thanks @arendjr! - Fixed #7638: useImportExtensions no longer emits diagnostics on valid import paths that end with a query or hash.
    Example
    // This no longer warns if `index.css` exists:
    import style from "../theme/index.css?inline";
  - #7071 a8e7301 Thanks @ptkagori! - Added the useQwikValidLexicalScope rule to the Qwik domain.
    This rule helps you avoid common bugs in Qwik components by checking that your variables and functions are declared in the correct place.
    Invalid:
    // Invalid: state defined outside the component's lexical scope.
    let state = useStore({ count: 0 });
    const Component = component$(() => {
      return (
        <button onClick$={() => state.count++}>Invalid: {state.count}</button>
      );
    });
    Valid:
    // Valid: state initialised within the component's lexical scope and captured by the event.
    const Component = component$(() => {
      const state = useStore({ count: 0 });
      return <button onClick$={() => state.count++}>Valid: {state.count}</button>;
    });
  - #7620 5beb1ee Thanks @Netail! - Added the rule useDeprecatedDate, which makes a deprecation date required for the graphql @deprecated directive.
    Invalid
    query {
      member @deprecated(reason: "Use `members` instead") {
        id
      }
    }
    Valid
    query {
      member
        @deprecated(reason: "Use `members` instead", deletionDate: "2099-12-25") {
        id
      }
    }
  - #7709 d6da4d5 Thanks @siketyan! - Fixed #7704: The useExhaustiveDependencies rule now correctly adds an object dependency when its method is called within the closure.
    For example:
    function Component(props) {
      useEffect(() => {
        props.foo();
      }, []);
    }
    will now be fixed to:
    function Component(props) {
      useEffect(() => {
        props.foo();
      }, [props]);
    }
  - #7624 309ae41 Thanks @lucasweng! - Fixed #7595: noUselessEscapeInString no longer reports $\{ escape in template literals.
  - #7665 29e4229 Thanks @ryan-m-walker! - Fixed #7619: Added support for parsing the CSS :state() pseudo-class.
    custom-selector:state(checked) {
    }
  - #7608 41df59b Thanks @ritoban23! - Fixed #7604: the useMaxParams rule now highlights parameter lists instead of entire function bodies. This provides more precise error highlighting. Previously, the entire function was highlighted; now only the parameter list is highlighted, such as (a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h).
  - #7643 459a6ac Thanks @daivinhtran! - Fixed #7580: Include plugin in summary report
