  2.2.3
  Patch Changes
  - #7353 4d2b719 Thanks @JeetuSuthar! - Fixed #7340: The linter now allows the navigation property for view-transition in CSS.
    Previously, the linter incorrectly flagged navigation: auto as an unknown property. This fix adds navigation to the list of known CSS properties, following the CSS View Transitions spec.
  - #7275 560de1b Thanks @arendjr! - Fixed #7268: Files that are explicitly passed as CLI arguments are now correctly ignored if they reside in an ignored folder.
  - #7358 963a246 Thanks @ematipico! - Fixed #7085, now the rule noDescendingSpecificity correctly calculates the specificity of selectors when they are included inside a media query.
  - #7387 923674d Thanks @qraqras! - Fixed #7381, now the useOptionalChain rule recognizes optional chaining using Yoda expressions (e.g., undefined !== foo && foo.bar).
  - #7316 f9636d5 Thanks @Conaclos! - Fixed #7289. The rule useImportType now inlines import type into import { type } when the style option is set to inlineType.
    Example:
    import type { T } from "mod";
    // becomes
    import { type T } from "mod";
  - #7350 bb4d407 Thanks @siketyan! - Fixed #7261: two characters ・ (KATAKANA MIDDLE DOT, U+30FB) and ･ (HALFWIDTH KATAKANA MIDDLE DOT, U+FF65) are no longer considered as valid characters in identifiers. Property keys containing these character(s) are now preserved as string literals.
  - #7377 811f47b Thanks @ematipico! - Fixed a bug where the Biome Language Server didn't correctly compute the diagnostics of a monorepo setting, caused by an incorrect handling of the project status.
  - #7245 fad34b9 Thanks @kedevked! - Added the new lint rule useConsistentArrowReturn.
    This rule enforces a consistent return style for arrow functions.
    Invalid
    const f = () => {
      return 1;
    };
    This rule is a port of ESLint's arrow-body-style rule.
  - #7370 e8032dd Thanks @fireairforce! - Support dynamic import defer and import source. The syntax looks like:
    import.source("foo");
    import.source("x", { with: { attr: "val" } });
    import.defer("foo");
    import.defer("x", { with: { attr: "val" } });
  - #7369 b1f8cbd Thanks @siketyan! - Range suppressions are now supported for Grit plugins.
    For JavaScript, you can suppress a plugin as follows:
    // biome-ignore-start lint/plugin/preferObjectSpread: reason
    Object.assign({ foo: "bar" }, baz);
    // biome-ignore-end lint/plugin/preferObjectSpread: reason
    For CSS, you can suppress a plugin as follows:
    body {
      /* biome-ignore-start lint/plugin/useLowercaseColors: reason */
      color: #fff;
      /* biome-ignore-end lint/plugin/useLowercaseColors: reason */
    }
  - #7384 099507e Thanks @ematipico! - Reduced the severity of certain diagnostics emitted when Biome deserializes the configuration files.
    Now these diagnostics are emitted as Information severity, which means that they won't interfere when running commands with --error-on-warnings
  - #7302 2af2380 Thanks @unvalley! - Fixed #7301: useReadonlyClassProperties now correctly skips JavaScript files.
  - #7288 94d85f8 Thanks @ThiefMaster! - Fixed #7286. Files are now formatted with JSX behavior when javascript.parser.jsxEverywhere is explicitly set.
    Previously, this flag was only used for parsing, but not for formatting, which resulted in incorrect formatting of conditional expressions when JSX syntax is used in .js files.
  - #7311 62154b9 Thanks @qraqras! - Added the new nursery rule noUselessCatchBinding. This rule disallows unnecessary catch bindings.
    try {
        // Do something
    - } catch (unused) {}
    + } catch {}
  - #7349 45c1dfe Thanks @ematipico! - Fixed #4298. Biome now correctly formats CSS declarations when it contains one single value:
    .bar {
    -  --123456789012345678901234567890: var(--1234567890123456789012345678901234567);
    +  --123456789012345678901234567890: var(
    +    --1234567890123456789012345678901234567
    +  );
    }
  - #7295 7638e84 Thanks @ematipico! - Fixed #7130. Removed the emission of a false-positive diagnostic. Biome no longer emits the following diagnostic:
    lib/main.ts:1:5 suppressions/unused ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
      ⚠ Suppression comment has no effect because the tool is not enabled.
      > 1 │ /** biome-ignore-all assist/source/organizeImports: For the lib root file, we don't want to organize exports */
          │     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  - #7377 811f47b Thanks @ematipico! - Fixed #7371 where the Biome Language Server didn't correctly recompute the diagnostics when updating a nested configuration file.
  - #7348 ac27fc5 Thanks @ematipico! - Fixed #7079. Now the rule useSemanticElements doesn't trigger components and custom elements.
  - #7389 ab06a7e Thanks @Conaclos! - Fixed #7344. useNamingConvention no longer reports interfaces defined in global declarations.
    Interfaces declared in global declarations augment existing interfaces.
    Thus, they must be ignored.
    In the following example, useNamingConvention reported HTMLElement.
    It is now ignored.
    export {};
    declare global {
      interface HTMLElement {
        foo(): void;
      }
    }
  - #7315 4a2bd2f Thanks @vladimir-ivanov! - Fixed #7310: useReadonlyClassProperties correctly handles nested assignments, avoiding false positives when a class property is assigned within another assignment expression.
    Example of code that previously triggered a false positive but is now correctly ignored:
    class test {
      private thing: number = 0; // incorrectly flagged
      public incrementThing(): void {
        const temp = { x: 0 };
        temp.x = this.thing++;
      }
    }
