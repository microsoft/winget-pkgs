InstallationNotes: |-
  • By default, the Winget package installs an Android Pie (Android 7) 32-bit environment. To install newer and 64-bit versions of Android, use the included BlueStack Multi-Instance Manager (As of BlueStacks 5.22.130.1019, the newest Android version is 13).
  • It is fully possible to use BlueStacks for non-game apps as well (including third-party launchers), especially since it supports sideloading APKs from Windows folders.
  • To prevent various gambling-related ads in BlueStacks, go to Settings → Preferences → Turn off the following："Allow BlueStacks to show Ads during gameplay", "Show featured banner on start", and "Open BlueStacks Store on start".
