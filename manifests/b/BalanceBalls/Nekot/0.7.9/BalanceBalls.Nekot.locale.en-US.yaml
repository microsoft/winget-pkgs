ReleaseNotes: |-
  New Features
  - Images support - you can now include images in a request. To attach an image use file picker (ctrl+a) or use a tag [img=/path/to/image] directly in the input field.
  - OperRouter provider support - set an API key OPENROUTER_API_KEY and set openrouter provider in the config or simply run nekot -p openrouter
  - Exclude reasoning tokens option - you can now configure to exclude reasoning tokens from requests to an LLM by setting the includeReasoningTokensInContext to false. Might be useful for some models, or if you want to reduce costs at quality's expense
