  Studio is an all-in-one desktop app for Windows and Mac that lets you build with virtual parts, render designs and create instructions.

  What can I do with Studio?

  By testing your design, you can find out if it can be built with real LEGO bricks.
  Create or browse instructions
  Use Instruction Maker to create step-by-step instructions for your designs
  Render designs
  Generate photorealistic images and short videos of your designs
  Share on the Studio Gallery
  Upload your designs on My Studio and publish them on Studio Gallery
