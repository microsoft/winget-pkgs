ShortDescription: File synchronization Tool
Description: Unison is a file-synchronization tool for POSIX-compliant systems (e.g. *BSD, GNU/Linux, macOS) and Windows. It allows two replicas of a collection of files and directories to be stored on different hosts (or different disks on the same host), modified separately, and then brought up to date by propagating the changes in each replica to the other.

  Changes in 2.53.8
  Released 2025-11-05
  - Improve and simplify makefiles.
    It is now possible to build with BSD make, Solaris/illumos make and
    NMAKE, in addition to GNU Make. Building with MSVC is much simpler
    now. The changes are larger than might be expected in a micro;
    anyone building from source (or packaging) should consult
    INSTALL.md for updated build instructions.
  - Stop installing fsmonitor.py.
  - Add ability to use reflinking instead of copying (if supported by
    filesystem).
  - Don't write fpcache if it is not necessary.
  - Experimental default-off support to detect moves/renames and
    rename on destination instead of copying (see -moves-experimental).
  Deprecation warning: support for external rsync will be removed,
  likely in 2.54.0.
  DEPRECATION MAY HAPPEN WITH LESS THAN TYPICAL NOTICE:
  lablgtk is difficult to use safely, and future maintenance is
  unclear. Implementing the GUI without lablgtk requires more effort
  than seems likely to happen. Thus, it is possible that support for
  the unison GUI may end suddenly, on a particular platform, or on all
  platforms -- even in a micro release. See
  #1075
  MAINTENANCE WARNING: No one is contributing to verify that the Mac
  GUI continues to work -- so it might not. (So far, there are no
  reports of serious failures.)
