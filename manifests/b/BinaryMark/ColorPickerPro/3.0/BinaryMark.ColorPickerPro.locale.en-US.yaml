ShortDescription: "Grab single or multiple pixel colors anywhere on your screen in more than 50 different formats. Convert colors between any of the 17 color models like RGB, HSL, Lab, LCH, XYZ. Choose from over 100 color variations: invert, contrast, warmer, darker..."
Description: "Whether you are looking to grab pixel colors from the screen, pick colors using different color models, convert between various color spaces, or simply experiment with color variations, Color Picker Pro has you covered! It is an ideal tool for designers, developers, and hobbyists who need precise color capture, selection, and conversion on the fly. Its 3 core components work together to achieve it: - Color Grabber lets you pick single or multiple pixels anywhere on your desktop. 3 operating modes with zoom support give you maximum flexibility: free-mouse and drag‑mouse for crude selection, and keyboard-arrow-keys for precise control. The grabber window stays small, so it does not obscure your view while at the same time letting you preview the picked color in the desired format instantly. - Once a color is grabbed or is manually selected, Color Picker lets you adjust its individual components like hue, saturation, brightness, or any of the other 17 color models' components with interactive sliders. You can fine‑tune each component independently with numeric input fields that allow you to enter exact values in any of the 50+ available formats. You also auto-generate more than 100 additional color variations: complement, inversion, contrast, warmer, cooler, brighter, darker, grayscale... - Color Converter lets you convert between all 17 supported color spaces: RGB, CMY; cylindrical - HSL, HSB/HSV, HSI, HWB; CIE - Lab, LCHab, Luv, LCHuv, XYZ; LMS, xyY, YCbCr, YDbDr, YUV, YIQ. The results are calculated with double‑precision accuracy, and you can choose from more than 50 different color formats to display results in or copy-to-clipboard, ensuring maximum cross-platform compatibility: byte, hexadecimal, percent, floating point, CSS, Photoshop,... Whether you’re picking the exact shade of a logo, converting a color to match print specification, or generating a palette for UI design, Color Picker Pro delivers the flexibility and precision you need."
