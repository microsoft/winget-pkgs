  - It's not possible anymore to send a printjob to a turned off cloud connected UltiMaker printer
  - You can now sponsor the Cura team from the Application Switcher, and Help menu
  - Infill behavior close to the skin to prevent jerky motions and visible overextrusion
  - The About Dialog includes more build information for Cura developers
  - Introduced more hardware info like system, release, version, processor, and CPU cores to the logging to improve troubleshooting.

  - The first support layers were printed incorrectly if adhesion was set to None, solves #14983
  - Some improvements to the Zseam for user-specified or the sharpest corner seam alignment
  - The support was printed before the brim when the origin was at the center of the buildplate, solves #14983
  - Printers with a high resolution value would incorrectly print embossed features,
  - The flow would unexpectedly increase after a bridge was completed.
  - Bridging settings would not be applied to the first skin layer if the infill density was set to 0, solves #9056
