  Summary
  This release improves Samsung TV and Kodi support, improves accessibility and keyboard navigation, improves the notification system on our web settings and web player, fixes bugs and more!
  This release includes some major version bumps of our dependencies, including React v19 and Vite v6
  We have also restored x86 Windows builds because of your feedback, thank you! We will not be able to release them forever, because many operating systems and our dependencies already do not support that architecture, but we will keep it around for a while more.
  V15 development is still continuing and you can expect to see more details about it soon, it's really exciting to see all the UI improvements coming!
