  Summary
  This release adds a new Docker release built on Ubuntu which might improve stability, we will release it alongside the existing Alpine Linux releases for a while until we get feedback from you.
  We updated our component library Mantine from v7 to v8 to improve our web interfaces, improved support for playlist files, improved UPnP support, improved performance in multiple ways, and fixed a lot of bugs. Please keep reporting them to us so we can fix them, and huge thanks to everyone who has.
  Changes
  General
  - Added new Ubuntu Docker release which might improve stability, we will release both for a while until we get feedback from you
  - Added support for updating album art objects via UPnP
  - Improved stability of YouTube video playback
  - Improved performance, especially of the web interfaces
  - Fixed support for playlist files without headers (#5736) (thanks, @CyDragon80!)
  - Fixed notifying renderers of new files before we parsed them
  - Fixed videos sometimes not being parsed if they were added at the same time as 2 parent directories
  - Fixed web player errors
  - Fixed Recently Added folder missing videos
  - Fixed order of videos in the Unwatched variant of the Recently Added folder
  - Discontinued YouTube video support for Linux armhf (32-bit) release, because yt-dlp stopped supporting that architecture. You can still compile it for yourself.
