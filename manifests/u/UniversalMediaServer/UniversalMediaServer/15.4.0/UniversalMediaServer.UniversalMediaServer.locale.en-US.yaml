  We have switched the default Docker operating system from Alpine Linux to Ubuntu, which fixes memory and stability problems. If you want to continue to use Alpine Linux, you can change to the universalmediaserver/ums-alpine repository.
  We have also done a lot of improvements to LG TV support, with native Dolby Vision support on 2022+ models (as long as you update to WebOS 25), better TV detection, and fixed support for DTS on 2025 models, since LG has unfortunately stopped supporting DTS again after only supporting it in 2023-2024 models :/
  There are a bunch of other important bugfixes for all devices which we know people have been patiently waiting for, and some more interface improvements to the web player.
  Thanks to everyone who reported their bugs, and also those who helped fix them. We had a great amount of community help with this release, which in the current software climate we are even more grateful for than ever!
