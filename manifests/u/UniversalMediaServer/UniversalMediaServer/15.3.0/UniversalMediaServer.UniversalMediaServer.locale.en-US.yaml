ReleaseNotes: |-
  In this release, we have improved the web player in a lot of ways, most of them shown in the before/after image below:
  15 3 0-mark-played-before-after
  This gives you the ability to mark a directory as fully played or unplayed for the current user, and gives more room for thumbnails on TV series pages.
  We also added a new system tray item to make it easier to open the web player that also has access to the settings, which we have called "Web player (full)":
  15 3 0-web-player-full
  We also added the ability to ignore files based on their extensions, fixed binaries (like FFmpeg, MediaInfo, yt-dlp, etc.) not updating on Windows, improved scanning speed (a lot in some cases) by not parsing files we don't support, and more.
  Changes
  - Added ability to mark directories as fully played for the user on the web player (#5879)
  - Added systray menu item for "Web player (full)", which is the web player with access to the full settings
  - Moved the "mark as fully played/unplayed" feature to the breadcrumbs on the web player
  - Update our file info when they are modified on the hard drive
  - Added file_extensions_ignored setting to ignore files based on their extensions (thanks, @somanchiu!)
  - Show 10 rating stars instead of 5 on web player
  - Put plot on the same line as the heading on web player
  - Moved the metadata editing/TMDB manual lookup functionality to the "Edit" button on the web player
