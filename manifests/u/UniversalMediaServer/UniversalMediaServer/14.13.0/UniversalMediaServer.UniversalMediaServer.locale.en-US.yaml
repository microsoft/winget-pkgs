  Summary
  In this release we have added support for Linkplay WiiM devices, improved LG TV support, added the ability for renderers to specify support for file muxing mode, fixed bugs and improved performance!
  This is likely to be one of the last v14 releases. We are really focusing on v15 but also still working with you to fix bugs in v14.
  The first v15 beta release will be out very soon, and if that goes well we can progress quickly to the first real v15 release. Thanks to everyone who has tried it so far, and we would love to get more feedback on it.
