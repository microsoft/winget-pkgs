ReleaseNotes: |-
  This first public v15 release is the result of over 9 months of hard work to make our web UI more intuitive and modern.
  We have added a user switcher with support for multiple logged-in users, a mode switcher to change between the two major areas: Player and Settings, pin code logins, dynamic TV season metadata, a file media info button, rewrites of our notification and realtime code, improved memory management, and a lot of other changes to improve usability and reduce the number of actions needed to do what you want.
  Phew.
  We would love to see any opinions or ideas you have. This version is our response to feedback and reviews of UMS, and we need more feedback to guide it further.
