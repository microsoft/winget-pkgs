Description: |-
  UrBackup is an easy to setup Open Source client/server backup system, that through a combination of image and file backups accomplishes both data safety and a fast restoration time.
  File and image backups are made while the system is running without interrupting current processes.
  UrBackup also continuously watches folders you want backed up in order to quickly find differences to previous backups. Because of that, incremental file backups are really fast.
  Your files can be restored through the web interface, via the client or the Windows Explorer while the backups of drive volumes can be restored with a bootable USB-Stick (bare metal restore).
  A web interface makes setting up your own backup server really easy. For a quick impression please look at the screenshots here.
  Currently there are over 21,000 running UrBackup server instances (with auto-update enabled) with some instances having hundreds of active clients.
