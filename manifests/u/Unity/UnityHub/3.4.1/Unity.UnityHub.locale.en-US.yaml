ReleaseNotes: "What’s new\n- We’ve launched a survey in the Hub to hear what you think about Unity. If you see it, please share your feedback!\n\nBug fixes & improvements\nAccessibility\n- The Hub will now follow your OS preferences related to reduced motion settings.\n- We’ve made it easier to use your keyboard to navigate dropdown items within context menus.\nDownloads and Installations \n- In some instances, the Hub window would appear as blank after selecting “retry” when an Editor download failed. We’ve corrected this.\n- We’ve corrected an issue where some users reported that certain modules did not load correctly, though the Hub said they did. \n- We’ve fixed a bug that prevented some users from progressing beyond the Hub's loading screen after restarting the application.\n- We’ve made improvements to the Hub’s Command-Line Interface (CLI) relating to resolving modules and Editor installations.\nWindows\n- For Windows users on Unity 2022.2 and above, the Hub would not detect the installation status of Microsoft Visual Studio 2022. This has been corrected.\n- For some Windows users, the Hub would not start if a user tried to open a project that was located on their NAS drive. We’ve resolved this.\nmacOS\n- For first time users, the Hub will now recommend the appropriate LTS Editor version for you to install depending on whether you are using an Apple silicon or Intel machine.\nTarget Platform\n- PlayStation 5 is now listed as build target for those with the required license type.\nUser Interface\n- The Hub will now display a warning before closing while a download or install is in progress. When the Hub is closed during a download, the download will be canceled.\n- The Hub now surfaces a message informing users which Editor versions are compatible with their Plastic SCM projects and packages. \n- Your list of installed Editor versions will sort properly based on version number (versus alphabetically).\n- After a user’s session expired and they followed the steps to sign in, the “session expired” modal would still appear in the Hub. We’ve corrected this.\n- The Hub will now inform you which Editor versions are compatible with premium packages."
