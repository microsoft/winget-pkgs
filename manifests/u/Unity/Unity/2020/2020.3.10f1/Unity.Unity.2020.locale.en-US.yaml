  Improvements
  - Asset Import: Improved overall performance of FBX files import.
  - Asset Import: Improved performance of ASCII FBX files import.
  - Graphics: Optimized static batching process, e.g. entering play mode with 30k static batched objects in the editor is faster by two seconds.
  - Graphics: Static batching and Mesh.CombineMeshes can handle more vertex formats now, for example Float16 normals or UVs. It also no longer clamps vertex colors to UNorm8 format - if input meshes have higher precision vertex colors, then combined mesh will have high precision colors too. (1274815)
  - macOS: Updated xcode project template to use "modern" build system. (1326316)

  Changes
  - Editor: Updated Collaborate package to allow users to migrate to Plastic.

  - Package Manager: Changed "Import again" button text to "Reimport".
  - XR: Updated the Oculus XR Plugin package to version 1.9.1.

  Fixes
  - 2D: Fixed an initial rendering animated tiles issue when a CompleteObjectUndo was registered for a Tilemap while in Play mode.

  - Asset Import: Fixed an issue where Import did not correctly update Avatar settings when switching from "Copy From Avatar". (1213138)
  - Build Pipeline: Fixed an issue where generating a build that includes a script which used serializable nested type deriving from type nesting it, could lead to a build at runtime. (1310970)
