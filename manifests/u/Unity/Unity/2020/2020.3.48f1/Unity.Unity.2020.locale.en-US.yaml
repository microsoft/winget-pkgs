  - Serialization: Improved performance of restoring managed objects during a domain reload.
  - XR: Improved GLES3 multiview rendering performance. (UUM-7008)

  Changes
  - Package: Added new QoS APIs for specific Relay and Multiplay QoS servers searching and result.
  - Version Control: Changed the icons for Unity Version Control rebrandingMarkdig.Syntax.Inlines.HtmlInline Changed onboarding workflow.

  Fixes
  - 2D: Show apply/revert dialog to user if there are data changes in Sprite Editor Window before domain reload. ("UUM-26175")

  - Editor: Ensure GraphicsFence.passed reports consistent results at initialization. ("UUM-27598")
  - Editor: Fixed a crash when importing specific FBX files with blendshapes. ("UUM-32291")
  - Editor: Fixed an issue that thread marker in Profiler window is lasting whole frame while audio is playing. ("UUM-401")
