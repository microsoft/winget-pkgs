  Features

  - Editor: Added Enable PlayMode Tooltips toggle to preferences.

  Improvements

  - Animation: Optimized AnimationClip size calculation reducing asset load time in the Editor.
  - Animation: Reduced the time required to load AnimationClip instances.
  - Editor: Improved performance of rendering the Project Settings. It would previously repeatedly query all objects loaded into the editor, which meant that operations that load assets into memory (entering playmode) would make the Project Settings unusable slow.
  - Graphics: Increased the maximum Async Upload Buffer Size to 2047 MB and updated docs.
  - Version Control: Added offline mode toggle for smoother offline experience.
  - Video: Report error only when the user uses MediaFoundation directly.

  API Changes

  - Graphics: Added: SystemInfo.computeSubGroupSize API, allows users to query the size of the compute thread group that supports efficient memory sharing on the GPU.
  - Graphics: Added: SystemInfo.maxTexture3DSize API, allows users to query the largest 3D Texture size that the graphics hardware supports.
  - Graphics: Added: SystemInfo.maxTextureArraySlices API, allows users to query the maximum number of slices in a Texture array that the graphics hardware supports.

  Fixes

  - 2D: Fixed error when a Tile asset with an instanced GameObject is removed from the Tilemap during a Collider2D.OnCollision***2D event. (UUM-15455)
  - 2D: Fixed Sprite Mode field is empty upon changing Texture Type to Sprite in TextureImporter. ("UUM-16278")
  - 2D: Fixed Stencil broken when rendering sprites with GPU instancing on. ("UUM-15295")
  - Android: Fixed error messages when hideInput is enabled in TouchScreenKeyboard. ("UUM-15609")
  - Android: When running Android SDK tool with elevated privileges use JDK bundled with Unity, previous behavior was the SDK tool would use java from PATH env variable, and would fail if there's no java installed and there's no java path set in PATH env variable. ("UUM-1942")
  - Animation: Fixed issue where, for some playable graphs, the animated displacement of the animated game object would keep accumulating when the game object was disabled and enabled. The original behaviour can be restored with the keepAnimatorStateOnDisable variable. ("UUM-3486")
  - Asset Bundles: Fixed issue where empty folders remained in the cache. ("UUM-15702")
  - Core: Dynamic Heap Allocator now holds on to one empty block to increase performance. ("UUM-1849")
  - Editor: Fixed an issue to causing too many open files errors when uploading to Accelerator. ("UUM-19028")
  - Editor: Fixed an issue to ensure context view context can't be duplicated, copied or cut. ("UUM-2655")
  - Editor: Fixed an issue where AssetDatabase.FindAssets would return invalid results when specifying multiple search folders. ("UUM-19314")
  - Editor: Fixed Assertion failed on expression: 'offsetIndex != -1' when loading scenes with async light probe tetrahedralization. ("UUM-17831")
  - Editor: Fixed Highlighter.Highlight does not disappear when the highlighted element disappears from view. ("UUM-3535")
  - Editor: Removed Exported define from SearchService to avoid domain reload. (UUM-18922)
  - GI: Fixed lightprobes getting direct lighting in subtractive mode. ("UUM-1344")
  - Graphics: Added safe-guards to prevent GetPixels / GetPixels32 crashes in cases where C# array creation would fail.
  - Graphics: Fixed a bug where ReadPixels would fail for textures larger than 2 GB.
  - Graphics: Fixed crash when creating a RenderTexture with dimensions exceeding the capabilities of the current graphics device. ("UUM-5459")
  - Graphics: Fixed cubemap uploads failing on Vulkan, D3D11 and D3D12 for cubemaps larger than 2 GB.
  - Graphics: Fixed GetPixelData / SetPixelData failing for textures larger than 2 GB. Added safe-guards to prevent NativeArray length overflows for the former API.
  - Graphics: Fixed LoadRawTextureData failing when the input NativeArray contained more than 2 GB of data. Added safe-guards to GetRawTextureData. (prevent NativeArray length overflow and C# array creation failure).
  - Graphics: Fixed mapped index debug error when rendering null geometry. (UUM-11997)
  - Graphics: Fixed RenderTexture assets not accepting texture dimensions greater than 20000 in UI, even though they currently can already go up to 32768 in script if the graphics capabilities allow for it.
  - Graphics: Fixed the mip bias setting on DX11. ("UUM-879")
  - Graphics: Fixed the Read/Write texture import setting becoming grayed out when "Max Size" was greater than 8192, regardless of actual texture dimensions or size. Replaced with an info box when enabling "Read/Write" that triggers if Unity detects a Markdig.Syntax.Inlines.HtmlEntityInline512MB texture.
  - Graphics: Prevent a crash on some platforms when the mesh buffers do not exist on a MeshRenderer. ("UUM-4150")
  - Graphics: Removed code to get vertex decl for null geometry in DX12. (UUM-1802)
  - Graphics: Texture 3D Preview (Volume / SDF mode) now becomes disabled if Unity detects a potential driver hang risk. Fixed an assert incorrectly being triggered when inspecting external Texture 3Ds.
  - IL2CPP: Allow constrained calls on stackalloc'd buffers. (UUM-14341)
  - IL2CPP: Avoid a possible race condition when the garbage collector is enabled or disabled that could cause it to become permanently disabled. (UUM-16300)
  - IL2CPP: Corrected the behavior of the System.IO.Compression.ZipArchive API. ("UUM-14582")
  - IL2CPP: Fixed occasional missing stack traces in Debug.Log's on Windows 10. ("UUM-12672")
  - IL2CPP: Monitor.Wait with zero timeout should return false. ("UUM-18188")
  - iOS: Fixed SystemInfo returning incorrect values for max compute buffer inputs on Metal. ("UUM-1939")
  - iOS: Fixed unity view behavior when in "split view". ("UUM-9081")
  - License: Make Unity build deterministic when using floating licenses. ("UUM-18489")
  - Linux: Fixed Multi Display mouse/touch input registers incorrectly on Linux Standalone player. (UUM-1569)
  - macOS: Removed developer placeholder text from progress dialog. (UUM-18221)
  - Networking: Fixed race condition between DownloadHandlerTexture and Resources.UnloadUnusedAssets, sometimes cause premature destruction of the texture. (UUM-18044)

  - Package Manager: Package manager window becomes unusable when installing the test framework package 1.3.0. (UUM-20659)
  - Particles: Fixed an emit from script bug when emitting particles from LateUpdate during Edit Mode. ("UUM-1920")

  - Particles: Fixed SetParticles API sometimes failing to emit the correct number of particles. ("UUM-17027")
