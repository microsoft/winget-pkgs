  System Requirements Changes

  Improvements
  - Editor: Added profiler markers around test setup, teardown, and execution.
  - Editor: Improved Editor rendering performance. (1277222)
  - Editor: Improving UTF documentation (DSTR-120)
  - Editor: Reduce the per-test overhead of running tests in the editor.
  - Editor: Reduce time taken by filtering operations when only a subset of tests is run.
  - Editor: Reduced the time taken to rebuild the test tree and to scan for assets a test created but did not delete.
  - Package Manager: Fixed an issue where using a Git URL with a revision and a package path in the wrong order would still clone the repository, introducing unnecessary delays before failing with an error.
  - Package Manager: Improved logging by adding logs for cache misses and tarball download steps.
  - Package Manager: Improved the error message when a Git dependency cannot be resolved because the path querystring and revision fragment are in the wrong order.
  - Package Manager: Increased the amount of information logged to upm.log at various levels.
  - Package Manager: Optimized Git package download times for repositories using submodules (with Git 2.28.0 or higher installed only).
  - Package Manager: Optimized Git package download times, most notably for repositories with a larger history.
  - Shaders: Reduced shader variant memory usage at runtime and memory consumption while loading shaders. (1296101)

  Changes
  - Graphics: Update postprocessing package to 3.1.0

  - Package Manager: Any Unity packages with a pre-release identifier in their versions will be tagged as Preview.

  Fixes
  - Animation: Fixed an issue when adding multiple StateMachineBehaviours to an object would not properly display in the Inspector Window. This may cause generated behaviours on Playables to also be displayed in the inspector in play mode (see case 1173312) (1278575)

  - Asset Pipeline: Fixed an editor crash when downloading corrupted metadata. (1306061)
  - Burst: Fixed a bug where eager-compilation could pick up out-of-date global Burst menu options for compiling.
  - Editor: Gracefully exit editor in the case where shader compiler process cannot be launched due to external conditions. (1319336)
  - Graphics: Fixed a missing clamp in spawn count issuw when the system support reaping particles. (1122404)

  - Graphics: Fixed wrong game view rendering issue when using very special projection matrices with SRP. (1268477)
  - IL2CPP: Avoid an incorrect InvalidCastException when a generic type using an enum generic parameter is cast. (1306288)
  - IL2CPP: Emit correct code for virtual methods with an in parameter of an array type. (1302459)
  - IL2CPP: Fixed a nullable value being corrupted after a call to GetType() in generic code. (1310458)
  - IL2CPP: Fixed an issue where Nullable incorrectly initiallized the value when the nullable object was created via the null coalescing operator from a null value. (1312533)
  - Linux: Fixed an issue where calling SetResolutionImmediate in HDRP would display blue. (1309848)
  - Linux: Fixed an issue where the Package Manager's prompt keeps reappearing to resolve packages. (1315014)
  - macOS: Fixed loss of input and occasional crashes when connecting and reconnecting controllers.Z. (1315229)
  - Mobile: Fixed an issue were errors are thrown on installing Adaptive Performance Package when Simulator window is open. (1296672)
  - Mobile: Fixed an issue when the settings view was narrowed "View license" text appeared on top of the toggle. (1303986)

  - Package Manager: Fixed an issue where files tracked by Git LFS were not retrieved when using a Git-based dependency with both a path and a revision. (1307682)
  - Package Manager: Fixed an issue where the packages-lock.json file was overwritten with the same contents but considered modified by Unity, sometimes resulting in unnecessary operations. (1299834)
  - Particles: Fixed a crash when using a Stop Action set to Disable. (1311212)
  - Physics: Clarified how certain HideFlags affected physics (1239147)
  - Physics: Fixed a crash when the maximum allowed ArticulationBody components (64) was reached in a single hierarchy. (1284372)
  - Physics: Fixed an issue where the physics debug window was lost forever after entering the playmode. (1230368)
