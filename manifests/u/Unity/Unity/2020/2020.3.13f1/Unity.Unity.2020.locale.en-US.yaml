  - iOS: Ignore plugins with wrong CPU type when creating xcode project, e.g. when building for run on device, libraries having CPU type "x64" (i.e. simulator libraries) will be ignored
  - Scripting: Update com.unity.ide.visualstudio to version '2.0.9'.
  - Shaders: Improved logging when compiling shader variants. (1338590)
