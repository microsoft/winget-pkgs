  6000.0.53f1 Release Notes
  Improvements
  - Documentation: Added keyboard support for copying code examples.
  - QNX: Multidisplay monitor commandline argument.
  - QNX: Window z-order index setting.
  API Changes
  - UI Toolkit: Added: Added two new fields to UxmlElementAttribute:
    - visibility: Defaults to "Default" but can be set to "Visible" or "Hidden" to override the default behavior, which hides elements with namespaces starting with Unity, UnityEngine, and UnityEditor.
    - libraryPath: Allows customization of the path where the element is displayed in the Project Library tab. (UUM-104888)
  Fixes
  - 2D: Fixed an issue in the Shadow Caster 2D shape editor that could cause exceptions to be thrown. (UUM-97647)
  - 2D: Fixed an issue with the TilemapRenderer when the TilemapRenderer has a Mask Interaction set to None and the user uses a shader which utilises the stencil buffer, and the stencil settings in the shader are not respected. (UUM-109109)
  - Audio: Fixed an issue that would cause the main thread to stall when loading projects/scenes. (UUM-100966)
  - Audio: Fixed an issue where the "Audio Resource" field on an Audio Source in some cases wouldn't be properly updated in prefabs. (UUM-104751)
  - DX12: Stencil reference value is applied correctly when using graphics jobs. (UUM-92267)
  - Editor: Added a message so the macOS Editor can properly ask the user for permission to access the microphone. This fixes a bug where if the Editor was launched via './run', instead of the Unity Hub, the microphone would not work. (UUM-109276)
  - Editor: Fixed an issue where the Unity Editor would still open after a user terminated the launch screen during project load. (UUM-107863)
  - Editor: Fixed floating license cleanup and concurrent license update in LicensingClient 1.17.1.
  - Editor: Fixed method decorated with HideInCallstack attribute being opened by IDE instead of the caller method. (UUM-99776)
  - Editor: Improved preview window toolbar style so large labels do not take too much space. (UUM-110119)
  - Editor: Loading RenderDoc in Windows Editor does not crash when GPU skinning(Batched) is enabled. (UUM-105820)
  - Editor: Removed an assert to replace it with a debug assert due to an issue with hierarchical animation component. (UUM-109748)
  - Editor: SpeedTree meshes and objects count differs when comparing the numbers in the Player with the Editor. (UUM-105402)
  - GI: Make APV work with Subscenes in URP. (UUM-104165)
  - Graphics: Fixed the "get_disableApplyMaterialPropertyDrawers can only be called from the main thread" exception that occurred occasionally with GPU Resident Drawer after a domain reload. (UUM-101193)
  - Input System: Fixed a problem where two devices were detected when connecting a wireless Nintendo Switch Pro controller on Windows. (UUM-109997)
  - Input System: Resolved an issue with the Siri Remote (Gen2) where navigating with the Directional Pad caused buttonSouth to become true. This was due to OS propogating A button events after a D-Pad click (rather than a swipe). (UUM-110170)
  - Profiler: Fixed Player hang during Autoconnect on long Player initialization. (UUM-101218)
  - Scripting: Added warning to tag manager if trying to add the same tag more than once. (UUM-99990)
  - Scripting: Scripting: Prevent recursion when unloading Scriptable Object. (UUM-77941)
  - Search: Support interface filtering for component and asset types. (UUM-109613)
