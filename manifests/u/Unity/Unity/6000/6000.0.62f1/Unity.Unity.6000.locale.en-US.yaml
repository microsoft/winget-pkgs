  6000.0.62f1 Release Notes
  Improvements
  - URP: Added logging for SDR rendering configuration when 10-Bit HDR Output is active. This helps you understand what to expect and any automatic adjustments URP makes. Refer to [Use Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) Rendering with HDR Output enabled](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.3/Documentation/Manual/urp/post-processing/hdr-output.html\) for more details. (UUM-115727)
  Changes
  - URP: Modified Universal Render Pipeline HDR Output behavior to maintain 16-bit HDR Output when switching to Render Pipeline Assets that don't support HDR Rendering. (UUM-115727)
  Fixes
  - 2D: Clean up and fix mesh and sprite normals for shadergraph. (UUM-121472)
  - 2D: Fixed issue where "Invalid AABB inAABB" and "Assertion failed on expression: 'awake.loadStarted'" errors are thrown when when instantiating a prefab with InstantiateAsync. (UUM-120045)
  - 2D: Fixed lighting artifacts and unclearable errors. (UUM-116762)
  - 2D: Fixed NullReferenceException with LightBatchingDebugger. (UUM-116667)
  - Android: Updated minimum Android SDK build and platform tools versions to 36.0.0. (UUM-123164)
  - Animation: Fixed copy/paste of ghost transitions when source state is not selected. (UUM-96725)
  - DX12: Fixed memory leak in certain scenarios when using DX12 + Graphics Jobs (split mode). (UUM-120637)
  - DX12: Fixed RenderPass stencil access validation error (ID 1377). (UUM-122912)
  - Editor: Burst SharedStatic memory is now cleared prior to object deserialization, which fixes a crash that could occur if jobs are scheduled during object deserialization. (UUM-77850)
  - Editor: Editor: Editor: Editor: Set the new input system to manage move and look and the MixedFov and Shader/Lit scenes from the URP samples. (UUM-71847)
  - Editor: Fixed failed assert when running Code Coverage builds. (UUM-122729)
  - Editor: Fixed for missing "Some values driven by GridLayoutGroup" when users alter elements under parent/sibling LayoutGroup. (UUM-100091)

  - Editor: Fixed OutOfRange error encountered while using the 'Edit the joint angular limits' button in the Articulation Body component. (UUM-119277)
  - Editor: Fixed sky contribution missing in fog when sky occlusion is enabled. (UUM-119276)
  - Editor: Fixed uGUI InputField deselecting with hardware keyboards on Android. (UUM-110545)
  - Editor: Machine id is no longer blank for majority of analytics. (UUM-113066)
  - Editor: Prevent logging session tokens in the editor log. (UUM-121872)
  - Editor: Updated Profiling tools page.
  - Engine Diagnostics: Fixed Segmentation fault occurring when using --reset-diagnostic-switches via CLI on Linux. (UUM-111566)

  - Graphics: Fixed cloud shadows popping when no shadows are rendered from directional light. (UUM-107688)
  - Graphics: Fixed occasional crash when changing shader in the inspector to the one with GrabPass. (UUM-121727)
  - Graphics: Fixed sporadic crash when using Cloth rendering with Vulkan. (UUM-90932)
