  Known Issues in 6000.0.16f1
  - 2D: Crash on PopulateContacts when many collisions are made simultaneously (UUM-78661)
  - Asset - Database: Crash on MonoBehaviour::Transfer when the XR Interaction Toolkit Sample Assets are updated (UUM-76934)
  - DirectX12: Crash on BufferD3D12::BeginWrite when enabling water exclusion in the Underwater sample scene (UUM-77863)
  - DirectX12: Crash on GfxDeviceD3D12Base::DrawBuffersCommon when opening a project after changing the Graphics API to DirectX12 (UUM-77757)
  - Lighting: Block compression leads to lightbaking artifacts in HDRP (UUM-74735)
  - Physics 2D: A potential crash can happen when a 2D Physics contact is created and destroyed in the same simulation step.
  - SRP Templates: A bunch of Shader Warnings are thrown after switching platform to Linux/Linux Server when using Universal 3D Template (UUM-76186)

  6000.0.16f1 Release Notes
  Improvements
  - Core: Optimized BootConfig lookups in XR and Shader code to improve performance.
  - Editor: Improved string usage among core engine classes, which results in fewer allocations and small performance improvements.
  - GI: Cached the result of rasterization during lightmap baking. This speeds up repeated bakes of the same scene significantly.
  - Universal RP: Improve the sample code in the URP Post Processing Effect (with Volume) template to remove a copy render pass.
  API Changes
  - GI: Added: Embree.GpuBvh.BuildOptions.isTopLevel, indicating whether to build a top level acceleration structure.
  - GI: Deprecated: EditorSettings.enableCookiesInLightmapper. Cookies are always supported by the lightmapper.
  - GI: Removed: EditorSettings.disableCookiesInLightmapper. Cookies are always supported by the lightmapper.
  Changes
  - Installer: Changed the default IDE suggestion on macOS to be Visual Studio Code since Visual Studio for macOS is no longer supported by Microsoft.
  Fixes
  - Android: Fixed a synchronized show-hide softInput operations issue. (UUM-71798)
  - Apple TV: Fixed Plugin Importer option Add To Embedded Binaries for AppleTV & fat mach-o libs (UUM-72637)
  - DX12: Fixed invalid resource states, when using a native graphics plugin for Unity. (UUM-75384)
  - Editor: Bug resolution for EditorUtility.DisplayDialog() not displaying text when the text is too long. (UUM-71871)
  - Editor: Fixed a crash when setting the C# skinWeights API to None. (UUM-76325)
  - Editor: Fixed a crash which would happen when creating BuildProfile objects in memory but never associating them with asset files on disk. (UUM-77423)
  - Editor: Fixed a freeze in the ForwardPlus Lighting calculation when the Camera farClipPlane is set to Infinity. (UUM-75536)
  - Editor: Fixed a memory leak on every domain reload caused by BuildProfile objects. (UUM-77810)
  - Editor: Fixed an Editor crash that would occur when accessing GUIManager in Server builds due to stripped IMGUI module. (UUM-76332)
  - Editor: Fixed an exception that was thrown when a helpbox is added as a child item to the reorderable list item. (UUM-74055)
  - Editor: Fixed an issue of Linux freezing whenever a file is dragged from Unity to VS Code. (UUM-60652)
  - Editor: Fixed an issue where icons would not set for some platforms through PlayerSettings.SetIcons. (UUM-77623)
  - Editor: Fixed APV seams and leaks that can occur between two subdivision levels when using Rendering Layers. (UUM-76513)
  - Editor: Fixed CursorLock engaging in EditMode when lock applied within OnDestroy. (UUM-76326)
  - Editor: Fixed some of default UxmlConverters being dependent on the Current Culture (Bounds, Rect, Vector-types). (UUM-77418)
  - Editor: Fixed warning for mixed lights falling back to baked appearing incorrectly. (GFXFEAT-772)
  - Editor: Improved the performance and discoverability of the Helper bar. The helper bar is in the status bar of the Editor and it only displays shortcuts bound to mouse buttons. (UUM-77227)
  - Editor: The behaviour of EditorGUIUtility.ObjectContent is reversed, so it does provide an icon when the reference is null.
  - Graphics: Fixed linear fog rendering artifacts on Adreno GPUs when Vulkan is the graphics API. (UUM-61728)
  - Installer: The independent Editor Installer will write install information to HKLM. (UUM-73881)
  - iOS: Fixed crash when rendering to backbuffer in Update. (UUM-77248)
  - Kernel: Fixed a player crash that would occur due to internal data races when loading assets. (UUM-72557)
  - Profiler: Fixed "Page range is outside of system region range. Please report a bug!" error for captured memory snapshots and opened in the Memory Profiler packaged, caused by Unity Objects getting created in-between of capturing the Managed Heap and Native Object data. Snapshots before this fix are not fixed by this change but future captures won't have the same issue. This also fixes cases where Unity Objects in a Memory Snapshot might have pointed at invalid data for their Managed Shell, which may have been most notable with MonoBehaviour and ScriptableObject types. This may also have fixed a vanishingly small amount of instances of reported "Leaked Managed Shell" objects where the Native Object part of the object got destroyed just after the managed Heap data was captured. The close timing makes the likelihood of all of these issues very rare and more likely the longer it takes to capture a snapshot. (UUM-77449)
  - Scene/Game View: Fixed an issue where Application.isFocused returns false when entering the Play Mode with the Game window set to Play Unfocused. (UUM-74498)
  - Scripting: Fixed PluginImporter.ClearSettings so it does not apply default values. (UUM-77816)
  - Shadergraph: Disallowed shader variant related settings to be set to negative values. (UUM-76472)
  - Shadergraph: Fixed a null reference exception when shader variant project settings were changed under certain circumstances. (UUM-75697)
  - Shadergraph: Fixed an issue where the Graph Inspector would not update after changing a node's precision from the context menu. (UUM-76008)
  - Shadergraph: Fixed an issue where using a color picker would cause the main preview to display cyan until the color picker was closed. (UUM-75670)
  - Shaders: Fixed a graphics performance regression on Windows Standalone. (UUM-74649)
  - UI Toolkit: Fixed errors that could occur when generating attributes for UxmlElements. (UUM-73445)
  - UI Toolkit: Fixed exception call stack with custom measure function. (UUM-77400)
  - UI Toolkit: Fixed visual artifact in background repeat when using repeat = round. (UUM-76752)
  - UI Toolkit: Modified the TreeView and the ListView so they now have a public member selectedIds which allows users to track the selected ID of items even if they are within a collapsed parent. (UUM-75225)
  - UI Toolkit: Provided a better error message when the generic version of UQuery.Q is called on a null element. (UUM-77897)
  - Universal RP: Fixed an issue with XRCopyDepth not working when running in RenderGraph.
  - Universal RP: Fixed XR isLastCamera check. (UUM-75655)
  - Video: Fixed an issue where the sound of videos in Video Player was lost when Bluetooth headphones are connected or disconnected. (UUM-75469)
  - VisionOS: Fixed an issue where visionOS builds requiring IL2CPP symbol generation (for example when enabling Method Name, File Name, and Line Number stacktrace information in Player Settings) would fail to build in Xcode. The process_symbols_il2cpp.sh script now has the execute permission applied. (UUM-77986)
  - WebGL: Fixed an issue where mouse button canceled events would emit after clicking and moving a mouse. (UUM-65367)
  - WebGL: [WebGPU] Added extension support for non-zero firstInstance values for indirect drawing.
  - WebGL: [WebGPU] Fixed a color banding issue with HDR renders.
  - WebGL: [WebGPU] Fixed a issue with BindGroup creation with sparse binding indices.
  - WebGL: [WebGPU] Fixed an issue with upside-down textures from ASyncGPUReadback.
