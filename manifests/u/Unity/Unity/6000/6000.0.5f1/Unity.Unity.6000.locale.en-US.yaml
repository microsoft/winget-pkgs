  Known Issues in 6000.0.5f1
  - DOTS: Job allocator contention causes slow job execution (UUM-73194)
  - Kernel: Profiler does not profile after building the Project with Autoconnect Profiler Option enabled (UUM-71750)
  - Kernel: VirtualFileSystem crash because of data races. (UUM-72557)
  - PhysX Integration: A 1000 times heavier GameObject will stutter when colliding with a lighter GameObject (UUM-65366)
  - Scene Management: Crash on Transform::SetParent when duplicating a Prefab in the Hierarchy (UUM-73287)
  - Texture: [AsyncLoadInEditor] Crash on memcpy when opening a project that loads TSS files (UUM-71323)
  - UI Toolkit Framework: "TextureImporterInspector.OnInspectorGUI must call ApplyRevertGUI to avoid unexpected behaviour." thrown when selecting Asset then selecting and deselecting Texture 2D (UUM-35998)
  - UI Toolkit Framework: The "StackOverflowException" error is thrown in the console and the Editor freezes when Spacebar is pressed after selecting the last element of a list (UUM-69616)
  - Universal RP: Objects are invisible in Scene view when using Wireframe Shading Mode (UUM-36914)
  - Vulkan: Editor crash when changing Vulkan Number of Swapchain Buffers (UUM-60016)
  - Vulkan: [Linux][Vulkan] Crash when using Nvidia drivers >545 and graphics API set to Vulkan (UUM-73447)
  6000.0.5f1 Release Notes
  Features
  - Shadergraph: Adds a new set of sample content - Production Ready Shaders - to the Shader Graph package.
  Improvements
  - DX12: Improved DX12 DRED info logging. (UUM-72380)
  - Graphics: Rendering Debugger - Improved docs on how to open and how to use Rendering Debugger. (UUM-71948)
  - UI Toolkit: Improved performance of UI Toolkit by enabling more cache usage during the layout. (UUM-28073)
  API Changes
  - Scripting: Added: Added new method string Hierarchy.GetPath(in HierarchyNode node) which returns the textual path name of a node using names of nodes. (UUM-72599)
  Fixes
  - Android: Added ability to create filters for Android devices to allow or deny devices from using the Vulkan API when Vulkan is in the list of Graphics APIs. With Android Vulkan Allow Filter List, one can allow certain devices to use Vulkan as the default API. Alternatively, with Android Vulkan Deny Filter List, one can limit certain devices from using the Vulkan API.
  - Android: Fixed issues where calling Cursor.visible on Android API 23 would cause a runtime error. Since https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/PointerIcon is only available on API 24 or higher. Cursor.visible won't do anything in API 23. (UUM-72191)
  - Android: Fixed regression because of androidApplicationEntry ordering. (UUM-72449)
  - Android: Update AndroidNativePlugin example in docs for all Android architectures. (UUM-72369)
  - Animation: Fixed additive animations ever increasing non animated values. (UUM-68376)
  - Animation: Fixed PlayableDirector fields that were not being updated when the Bindings section was expanded. (UUM-71674)
  - Apple TV: Fixed tvOS simulator input crash. (UUM-70232)
  - Build System: Fixed an issue where building unity source code would fail because of unused variables in release mode. (UUM-71554)
  - Core: Fixed APV baking when there is no geometry in the scene. (UUM-72334)
  - Documentation: Updated manual page for UnityWebRequest upload handlers.
  - Editor: Fixed a SpeedTree9 shader error when opening the HDRP Test project the first time. (UUM-72676)
  - Editor: Fixed active clutch shortcuts not resetting when opening a popup menu. (UUM-64421)
  - Editor: Fixed an issue where the TextureImporter didn't correctly apply "Read/Write" for Texture3Ds (always treated as enabled). (UUM-68471)
  - Editor: MacOs framework bundles now preserve their symbolic links when when they are dragged and dropped in the editor Assets. (UUM-70795)
  - EmbeddedLinux: Fixed Screen.resolutions. (UUM-66341)
  - GI: Added functionality to set GI Cache Preferences from CLI Args. (UUM-68608)
  - Graphics: Fixed applying a wrong viewport when a deferred camera uses a modified viewport together with a user-defined render target. (UUM-70711)
  - Graphics: Fixed int64 pragma requires being ignored in ray tracing hlsl code: pragma require int64 and pragma require int64bufferatomics. (UUM-72651)
  - Graphics: Graph and Camera options for Render Graph Viewer disappear after maximising the window. (UUM-70378)
  - Physics: Fixed an issue where a Collider's filter data would not properly update when setting a new layer to the GameObject the component is on. This caused collisions to either be ignored or not based on the previous layer's mask rather than the new one. (UUM-72299)
  - Physics: Fixed an issue where pose updates to character controller would be rejected due to incorrect comparisons when checking if pose was changed. (UUM-72540)
  - Physics: Fixed an issue where the collision layer matrix would be incorrectly scaled. A follow up fix will be done to fully enable dpi scaling for this part of the UI. (UUM-61750)
  - Physics: Fixed window titles for the physics manager UI in Project Settings -> Physics and Project Settings -> Physics -> Settings. (UUM-61750)
  - Player: Fixed player memory leak when managed reference registry was destroyed. (UUM-72074)
  - Prefabs: Disable Show Overrides reference patching. (UUM-71887)
  - Scene/Game View: Fixed an issue where overlays layout would not be correctly restored when reopening an editor window. (UUM-69952)
  - Scripting: Fixed a crash when trying to use hierarchy core module APIs in multiple threads. Note that the APIs are not thread safe, but now they can be used in threads as long as the objects remain in the same thread. (UUM-72601)
  - Scripting: Lifetime of various hierarchy core module objects should no longer cause a crash on platforms that can be reinitialized without leaving the application. (UUM-72600)
  - Shadergraph: Addressed an issue where convert-to subgraph would sometimes result in an exception. (UUM-71892)
  - SRP Core: Game view background turn yellow after enable render graph. (UUM-65460)
  - uGUI: Consistent detection of points within the boundaries of RectTransform-defined rectangles. (UUM-69945)
  - UI Toolkit: Add support for content width generic menu. (UUM-69694)
  - UI Toolkit: Fixed being unable to resize a visual elements in the UI Builder viewport when it has flex grow. (UUM-72096)
  - UI Toolkit: Fixed exception when reparenting a template instance inside another template instance. (UUM-72537)
  - UI Toolkit: Fixed setting the Toggle text to null or empty when it previously had a value. (UUM-70651)
  - Universal RP: Fixed an issue where shadows for additional lights were incorrectly ordered when using deferred rendering. (UUM-71595)
  - Universal RP: Fixed an issue where shadows for additional lights were still rendering even though they were disabled in the URP Asset. (UUM-71598)
  - Universal RP: Fixed an issue where shadows for additional lights would flicker if additional lights exceeded the maximum amount of shadow casting lights. (UUM-39576)
  - VFX Graph: Disable compile menu when authoring subgraphs. (UUM-556)
  - VFX Graph: Fixed the ability to add blocks to subgraph context. (UUM-69798)
  - VFX Graph: VFX Graph VFXOutputEventHandlers Sample now compatible with Cinemachine 3.x. (UUM-72276)
  - WebGL: [WebGPU] Fix SRP Batcher crash with multi-part meshes.
  - WebGL: [WebGPU] Fix URP error with multisampled depth textures.
