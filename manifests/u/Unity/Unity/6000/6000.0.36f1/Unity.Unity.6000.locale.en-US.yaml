  Known Issues in 6000.0.36f1
  - 3D Physics: "Failed to create Convex Mesh from source mesh" PhysX errors are thrown when looking around the Scene View while Collision Geometry is set to true (UUM-93081)
  - Asset - Database: Crash on MonoBehaviour::Transfer when the XR Interaction Toolkit Sample Assets are updated (UUM-76934)
  - Audio Authoring: Audio Reverb Zone still produces sound when the Audio Source volume is 0 (UUM-92689)
  - Audio Authoring: Audio Source clip is not audible when exceeding a high number of active Audio Sources (UUM-91256)
  - Build Settings Window: Application Cloud Connection Id is incorrect when using Build Profile with Player Setting Overrides. (UUM-90426)
  - DirectX12: A memory leak occurs in Play mode when using Direct3D12 Graphics API (UUM-91900)
  - DirectX12: Allocated graphics memory does not get released when the Editor is out of focus while using D3D12 graphics API (UUM-86354)
  - Graphics Optimization Systems: Vertex snapping doesn't work when the GPU Resident Drawer is enabled (UUM-66422)
  - HDRP: Graphics Compositor breaks Unity rendering when the "Output Camera" is changed to a scene Camera and one Camera SubLayer is active.

  - Input: Player .exe remains open as a background task after closing it when Active Input Handling is set to "Input System Package (New)" (UUM-91181)
  - Materials: Decal Projector produces artifacts when the normal and decal are projected in negative z-direction and Normal Blend is set to 1 (UUM-92200)
  - Packman: Unable to install ProBuilder package when project is located in an external FAT32/exFAT drive (UUM-86351)
  - Scene Hierarchy: “Application.Message.LeftButtonUp” loads indefinitely when trying to select a GameObject with disabled selection (UUM-96065)
  - Scripting Runtime: Crash on UnityEditor.AssetDatabase:StopAssetEditing when removing HDRP Package after having imported Water Samples (UUM-78164)
  - Serialization: The "UniversalRenderPipelineGlobalSettings.asset" is creating noise in the git diff when building a Player (UUM-80052)

  - SpeedTree: This release of SpeedTree includes a change to the interface of the SpeedTree8Wind shadergraph node. If you have an animated SpeedTree in the shadergraph, be sure to connect an ObjectSpacePosition node to the input of the SpeedTree8Wind. If the wind node does not have an input on the ObjectSpacePosition port, the mesh will be shrunk down to a point at origin (making it seem to vanish).

  Fixes
  - 2D: Fixed an issue where the Sprite Renderer with Animation did not reflect Sprite changes in the Scene when switching Mask Interaction. (UUM-92310)
  - 2D: Fixed initial marquee not showing up when picking on a Tile Palette without any TilemapEditorTool active. (UUM-77045)
  - 2D: Fixed minor cosmetic styling on Sprite Editor Window module drop down control. (UUM-91001)
  - 2D: Fixed Sprite Editor Window module drop down text gets cut off in Linux Editor. (UUM-91371)
  - Android: Fixed an issue by no longer setting theme attribute for application manifest in unityLibrary manifest, that means there's no default theme for activities and you're responsible for applying theme to your custom activities. The reason for this change, there's no valid default theme which can be applied for both Activity and GameActivity at the same time. (UUM-80017)
  - Android: Fixed an issue where BaseUnityGameActivityTheme.Translucent theme for GameActivity was missing. (UUM-80017)
  - Android: Fixed touch events not working for GameActivity when cursor is locked. You can see the change in UnityPlayerGameActivity.java. (UUM-90583)
  - Asset Pipeline: Fixed script not being loaded properly the first time when changed outside of the editor. (UUM-92704)
  - Editor: Editor exits Play mode when another project is being created. (UUM-68141)
  - Editor: Fixed a Stack Overflow issue by not using recursion to collect information about profiler samplers. (UUM-79067)
  - Editor: Fixed Application.cloudProjectId returning incorrect Id when using build profiles with player setting overrides. (UUM-90426)
  - Editor: Fixed build profile build command line ignores override global scenes option and always use profile's scenes. (UUM-87796)
  - Editor: Fixed BuildPipeline.BuildPlayer with build profile ignores override global scenes option and always use profile's scenes. (UUM-87793)
  - Editor: Fixed implicit truncation shader warnings when using the multiplayer VR template. (UUM-84269)
  - Editor: Fixed issue where the grid size input field in the Grid & Snap toolbar overwrites values during active input. By changing it to a delayed field, the value won't be overwritten during active input. (UUM-91214)
  - Editor: Fixed issue with text tag with 8+ arguments. (UUM-91799)
  - Game Core: Fixed filtering folder plugin directories during the build process. (UUM-92581)
  - Graphics: Fixed a crash that can happen when using ray tracing affects and Skinned Mesh Renderers using Dynamic Transform Ray Tracing mode. (UUM-90573)
  - Graphics: Fixed incorrect lightmap textures bound to objects after additively loading or unloading scenes in the case of objects rendered through the GPU Resident Drawer. (UUM-91854)
  - Graphics: Fixed the rendered color of the preset differs from the preview color when adding a new swatch in the HDR Color Picker. (UUM-86724)
  - Graphics: Improved JobHandle.Complete() to avoid stealing work that is unrelated to the job being completed.

  - Mono: Fixed issue where macOS machines set to Morocco/Casablanca Timezone were one hour behind. (UUM-87263)
  - Physics 2D: Allow "Rigidbody2D.SlideMovement.surfaceUp" to have zero magnitude. When this is used, it allows the "Rigidbody2D.Slide" feature to move in a "top down" view where all surfaces can be slid across. (UUM-91870)
  - Shaders: Fixed a situation where some shaders would appear to cause an internal communcations error with the shader compiler. (UUM-72852)
  - SpeedTree: Fixed an issue where SpeedTree7 and SpeedTree8 shaders were not compatible with Unity6. (UUM-87614)
