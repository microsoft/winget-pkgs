  6000.0.21f1 Release Notes
  Features
  - Editor: Added the Asset Manager for Unity packages into Package Manager > Services > Content Management section.
  Changes
  - Package Manager: Changed the color of selected icons to be more consistent with other elements in light mode.
  Fixes
  - 2D: Fixed an issue with Render Graph 2D light look up resource usage. (UUM-79452)
  - Android: Fixed VideoPlayer test instabilities on some devices. (UUM-78032)
  - Animation: Fixed an issue where entry transitions were not reporting warnings when one of their parameters was deleted. (UUM-77622)
  - Editor: Added a more descriptive error message if FileUtil::ReplaceDirectory() fails to delete the destination directory. (UUM-62633)
  - Editor: Added support for Normal Map Encoding setting to be set with Build Profiles. (UUM-73430)
  - Editor: Fixed an issue that occurs when using dynamic color usage hints along with Text. (UUM-72341)
  - Editor: Fixed an issue where RPCore RenderGraphPerformanceTests are failing after additional error checking in ImportTexture. (UUM-81537)
  - Editor: Fixed an issue where the built-in "Cycle Tool Modes" shortcut would never enter the GameObject context. (UUM-79497)
  - Editor: Fixed an issue with splacescreens by using more specific keys for caching splash screens rather than clearing the splash screen cache on all changes. Clearing out the splash screen hash could cause race conditions that would cause a build to fail. If splash screens are not being cached properly, you can clear out the cache before a build by deleting the SplashScreenCache folder in the Library. (UUM-41830)
  - Editor: Fixed ALLOC_TEMP_MAIN warnings when passing Accelerator command line arguments. (UUM-74922)
  - HDRP: Fixed a sun flicker where the sun is close to cloud boundaries. (UUM-70628)

  - Package Manager: Fixed an issue where "Add by name" and "Add by git url" dropdowns are showing in incorrect positions. (UUM-77939)
  - Player: Fixed a corner case crash bug on server build player shutdown. (UUM-61775)
  - Shadergraph: Added padding to Shader Graph Preferences settings. (UUM-78064)
  - SRP Core: Fixed an issue when using multiple AddBlitPass would binds the _BlitTexture wrongly. (UUM-75542)
  - Universal RP: Enabled Native RenderPass option to follow Universal Renderer Data when rendering Game view. (UUM-73849)
  - URP: Fixed an issue to prevent repetitive error logs about C-buffer layout mispatch in GPU-instancing-enabled Speed Tree materials when enabling Rendering Layers. (UUM-64059)
  - VFX Graph: Fixed sticky note resizing could be broken. (UUM-73834)
  - Web: Fixed an issue where THE WebGPU graphics backend would incorrectly identify float 32 render textures as blendable formats for the WebGPU graphics API. (UUM-77338)
  - Windows: Fixed an issue where quad audio output mode would erroneously result in audio being sent to the center channel on 5.1 hardware. (UUM-52906)
