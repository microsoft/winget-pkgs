  6000.3.3f1 Release Notes
  Improvements
  - IL2CPP: Fixed some of the problems building the il2cpp.sln that is available to source code customers.
  - IL2CPP: Small performance improvement in generic variance type checks.
  - Physics: Exposed log verbosity as a option within the physics pane in order to allow users to suppress some warnings/logs coming out of the PhysX integration. The new setting can be found under Edit->Project Settings->Physics->Settings within the GameObject tab. (PHYS-681)
  Changes
  - Adaptive Performance: Made Adaptive Performance Android Provider package discoverable in the Unity Package Manager.

  - 2D: Fixed crash when SpriteRenderer with Polygon2DCollider has size of 0 for 9-slice. (UUM-128496)
  - 2D: Fixed issue where the correct values for the cell layout and sizing are not shown in a Tile Set importer inspector when the TileSet is selected or its changes are applied or reverted. (UUM-126070)
  - 2D: Fixed memory spike after activating Freeform Light2Ds. (UUM-121040)
  - Asset Bundles: Fixed cache-related crash on iOS when loading assets. (UUM-120877)

  - Editor: Fixed errors not being displayed in the Ray Tracing Shader inspector when creating a Ray Tracing Shader containing compilation errors using ShaderUtil.CreateRayTracingShaderAsset. (UUM-129385)
  - Editor: Fixed exiting a viewpoint not reverting back to 2d mode. (UUM-78682)
  - Editor: Fixed instance status icon shows loading after the scenario was cancelled in the scenario status dropdown. (UUM-127475)
  - Editor: Fixed LinuxEditor accelerator key changes made by a context menu from persisting after the menu is closed. (UUM-127693)
  - Editor: Fixed MixedFOV scene unapplied prefab in URP Package Sample. (UUM-125671)
  - Editor: Fixed unapplied changed in prefab MainPanel in BlobShadow scene in URP Package Sample. (UUM-125677)
  - Editor: Fixed Unity Editor not detecting Unity Hub installation on Linux. The Editor now correctly checks both user-local (~/.local/share/applications/) and system-wide (/usr/share/applications/) locations for the Hub desktop file, and properly respects the XDG_DATA_HOME environment variable. (UUM-96606)
  - Editor: Flipped Y-axis for pointer input coordinates of NMouse in Input System. (UUM-126062)
  - Editor: Removed unsused lighting setting file in URP Package Sample. (UUM-125859)
  - Editor: Rename the particle systems with meaningful names. (UUM-125864)
  - Editor: TaskCanceledException when stopping a play mode scenario. (UUM-127653)
  - Engine Diagnostics: Fixed issue where binaries with a non-zero load address would not be symbolicated correctly in Engine Diagnostics. (UUM-129639)
  - GI: Fixed a bug where loading a scene that contained light probe data, but was baked with "Baked Indirect" mode, caused a warning to be fired. (UUM-112568)
  - GI: Fixed an issue where a warning would be displayed, and light probes would look incorrect when loading a scene lit only by Enlighten Realtime GI, and no baked GI. (UUM-129727)
  - GI: Fixed an issue where the Meta pass was being incorrectly included in builds where it was not needed. (UUM-116130)
  - Graphics: Allow to set Render Pipeline Asset alongside with Global Settings in case when Asset Bundles were used. (UUM-103724)

  - IL2CPP: BEE_BUILD_THREADS will now be respected when il2cpp is used to compile an exported project. (UUM-129014)
  - Input System: Fixed multiple mouse button presses not processed after Mouse.current.WarpCursorPosition() on Windows. (UUM-128971)

(UUM-128624)
  - Physics: Improved performance of heightfield creation for terrain collider while async loading. (UUM-120104)
