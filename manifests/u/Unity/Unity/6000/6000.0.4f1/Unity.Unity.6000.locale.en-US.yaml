  Known Issues in 6000.0.4f1
  - 3D Physics: 3D Physics Layer Collision Matrix elements are misaligned when new Layers are added (UUM-61750)
  - Kernel: Profiler does not profile after building the Project with Autoconnect Profiler Option enabled (UUM-71750)
  - Kernel: VirtualFileSystem crash because of data races. (UUM-72557)
  - Lighting: [HDRP] Light doesn't bounce off terrains (UUM-71171)
  - PhysX Integration: A 1000 times heavier GameObject will stutter when colliding with a lighter GameObject (UUM-65366)
  - UI Toolkit Controls: MultiColumnListView causes a memory leak when repeatedly shown and hidden (UUM-72241)
  - UI Toolkit Framework: "TextureImporterInspector.OnInspectorGUI must call ApplyRevertGUI to avoid unexpected behaviour." thrown when selecting Asset then selecting and deselecting Texture 2D (UUM-35998)
  - UI Toolkit Framework: The "StackOverflowException" error is thrown in the console and the Editor freezes when Spacebar is pressed after selecting the last element of a list (UUM-69616)
  - Universal RP: Errors are thrown and the Scene view is not rendered when Rendering Path is set to Deferred (UUM-63928)
  - Visual Effects: Crash on block_merge_next when moving a GameObject with a specific Particle System Component and Rate Over Distance is set to above 0 in the Emission tab (UUM-72971)

  6000.0.4f1 Release Notes
  Improvements
  - Editor: Added functionality for ModelImporter Presets that now allows the editing of clip list values and various animation settings. (UUM-63487)
  - Editor: Faster check for the native subpasses limit and less duplicated code (UUM-65454)
  - Editor: Ship arm64 7-Zip with the arm64 Windows Editor, instead of an x64 7-Zip
  - Physics: Improved joint actor frame computation by ensuring initial actor frames only get set during initialization or when assigning a connected body to the joint. (PHYS-337)
  API Changes
  - Editor: Changed: [Android] "Resizable Window" setting has been renamed to "Resizeable Activity" and the default value is set to true for new projects.
  Changes
  - Editor: ObjectField label is now shown with 70% opacity for null values. This applies to both UI Toolkit and IMGUI. (UUM-16396)
  - Editor: EditorGUIUtility.ObjectContent will no longer include an icon when the value is null. When the type of object is stated in the label, there is no need for the type icon to be shown. Showing an icon when the value is null can create confusion and when the value is "Missing" it can be perceived as there is a texture there named missing. If you still wish to have an icon you can use AssetPreview.GetMiniTypeThumbnail(type); (UUM-16396)
  - Package: Updated localization to 1.5.2
  Fixes
  - Android: Bump Android Logcat Package to 1.4.2
  - Android: Fixing problem with UnityPause method not being called when using GameActivity and starting full screen video. (UUM-64875)
  - Android: Update GameActivity to 3.0.3 version, it fixes a crash when playing full screen video. (UUM-71913)
  - Android: Updated App Bundle size validation, updated link for the actual Google Play size limits (UUM-71849)
  - Asset Bundles: Improve parallelism of the Main Thread integration and the Preload Manager thread (UUM-70670)
  - Audio: Fixed a bug that would cause the editor to crash if you delete and then re-add an audio listener component. (UUM-346)
  - Audio: Fixed a bug that would cause the editor to throw a null reference exception when selecting a clip with auto play turned on. (UUM-71823)
  - Audio: Fixed an issue where the the AudioRandomContainer editor window would be blank and an error logged after deleting the displayed asset.
  - Burst: Fixed an issue with auto promotion from bool to float that can occur with newer Roslyn
  - Burst: Fixed build error when Product Name contains illegal path characters
  - Burst: Fixed compilation error when trying to use MemoryMarshal.GetReference on Spans
  - Burst: Fixed crash caused by faulty no-alias analysis
  - Editor: Build Profile Player Settings - It's possible to set WebGL's texture compression format per build profile (UUM-70174)
  - Editor: Fix "PlatformHasFlag is not allowed to be called from a ScriptableObject constructor" error when entering play mode with a plugin selected in the inspector (UUM-71725)
  - Editor: Fix for [Windows] Editor crashes during shutdown if "Cancel" changes to InputActions (UUM-65232)
  - Editor: Fix not raising RenderPipelineTypeChanged callback if only scene view is active (UUM-70198)
  - Editor: Fix random Editor crash with dx12 (UUM-71844)
  - Editor: Fix seams caused by different subdivision levels (UUM-66573)
  - Editor: Fixed editor crash when custom build profile is set active. (UUM-71737)
  - Editor: Fixes regressed --linker-flags-file bug (UUM-71341)
  - Editor: Platform list for Xbox platform made clearer. (UUM-71926)
  - Editor: The operator== method was using Assert.Equals to check Pose equality, when it should have been using ==. The Equals method was using ==, when it should have been using Assert.Equals
    Affected Versions: 2021 and above (UUM-48738)
  - Editor: UnityEditor.Build.Content.ObjectIdentifier comparison operators have been changed to be more consistent and use all of the fields. This improves determinism for asset bundle builds. (UUM-71772)
  - Graphics: Fix DepthNormalsTexture rendering error with shaders that have GrabPass as the first defined pass (UUM-71175)
  - Graphics: Fixed an issue where default TextureImporter presets excluding "Max Texture Size" properties could make textures import at a size of 1x1. (UUM-67833)
  - HDRP: Fix static lighting sky used when baking multiple scenes (UUM-70782)
  - HDRP: Fixed artefacts on borders between volumetric clouds and geometry (UUM-69809)
  - HDRP: Fixed perceptual blending option on volumetric clouds (UUM-70629)
  - iOS: Fixed symlinks not being preserved in Frameworks when exporting an iOS project (UUM-71657)
  - iOS: fixed WebCamTexture being non readable (UUM-70550)
  - Linux: Fixed touch freezes in Player when any mouse button is clicked (UUM-70659)
  - Physics: Fixed an issue caused by a previous change to IgnoreCollision where clearing colliders from the ignorance list would stop their list ID effectively losing all other ignorance pairs those colliders had (UUM-72148)
  - Physics: Fixed an issue where joint local body frame would drift when anchors get recalculated. Causing the joint to lose it's initial rest frame. (UUM-58304)
  - Physics: Related to the entry of UUM-58304, the main issue of the joint frame is fixed and the old behavior when no extended limits are present functions as expected. When extended limits are used in conjunction with a motorized hinge, the hinge joint local body frame no longer gets an offset based on the current transforms of the bodies attached to the joint. Previously this would happen due to the internal PhysX joint being recreated as either a 6-dof or hinge joint depending on a motor/spring being used or not. (UUM-70652)
  - Serialization: Fix enum fields when multiple C# Generic types are present (UUM-71808)
  - UI Elements: Fixed the undo/redo in the MinMaxSlider control for the editor. (UUM-54752)
  - UI Elements: Isolated the text edition changes to the touch screen text editor. (UUM-71488)
  - UI Toolkit: Fix some error when importing UXML asset when the system locale is in Turkish (UUM-71670)
  - UI Toolkit: Fixed "NullReferenceException" error is thrown when calling UIDocument.runtimePanel while UIDocument is not yet initialized (UUM-71707)
  - UI Toolkit: Fixed an issue where the editor binding system would update the underlying SerializedObject multiple times instead of once. (UUM-71919)
  - UI Toolkit: Fixed element name being deleted when pressing the "ESC" key to cancel the renaming of an element in UI Builder. (UUM-71820)
  - URP: Fixed SRP per-XRPass control to disable FR for intermediate render passes on untethered XR device if renderViewportScale is active when using URP RenderGraph (UUM-68027)
  - Windows: Ensure that the information read from HID devices are readed correctly even when the driver isn't fully compliant. (UUM-72147)
