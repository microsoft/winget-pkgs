  Known Issues in 6000.0.19f1
  - 3D Physics: Crash on PhysicsDebugDrawSelectFilteringUpdate when entering play mode with Physics Debug window docked and unfocused (UUM-79618)
  - Android: Error in onPixelCopyFinished after updrading to Unity 6 (UUM-79451)
  - DirectX12: Crash on BufferD3D12::BeginWrite when enabling water exclusion in the Underwater sample scene (UUM-77863)
  - DirectX12: Crash on GfxDeviceD3D12Base::DrawBuffersCommon when opening a project after changing the Graphics API to DirectX12 (UUM-77757)
  - Editor Platform: [Linux] Crash on 'PPtr::operator RuntimeAnimatorController*() const' when saving a new animation file (UUM-79812)
  - Graphics Optimization Systems: Shader errors in DXC when building an empty URP project for Windows platform on a MacOS machine (UUM-78665)
  - Hybrid Renderer: [Linux] Crash on ScriptableBatchRenderer::GenerateBuiltInCBuffer when adding "PerObjectData.ReflectionProbes" (UUM-79332)
  - Lighting: Block compression leads to lightbaking artifacts in HDRP (UUM-74735)
  - PhysX Integration: OnTriggerStay is called indefinitely after first time it is triggered when there is no GameObject inside the trigger (UUM-78460)
  - SRP Core: [URP 3D Sample] Light rendering artifacts visible in Universal 3D Sample Template. It seems to be that Shader Graphs/Screen_Graph is causing the issue. Disabling objects with this material will no longer reproduce light artifacts.
    [UUM-78796] <https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/light-rendering-artifacts-visible-in-universal-3d-sample-template>
  - SRP Templates: Buffer count exceeding default GL_MAX_SHADER_STORAGE_BUFFER_BINDINGS Shader Warnings are thrown after switching platform to Linux/Linux Server when using Universal 3D Template (UUM-76186)
  - SRP Workflow: Missing dependencies in Universal RP package when installing Unity Editor offline (UUM-79004)
  - Vulkan: Editor crash when changing Vulkan Number of Swapchain Buffers (UUM-60016)
  6000.0.19f1 Release Notes
  Fixes
  - 2D: Added depth write/test controls to sprite targets in shadergraph. (UUM-78999)

  - Android: Fixed an issue with building Addressables content when an empty folder is added to the addressable group. (UUM-77003)
  - Editor: Fixed a crash in shader variant prefiltering when renderpipeline asset had a broken reference. (UUM-76152)
  - Editor: Fixed an issue in the Project browser where the top toolbar would not display correctly when the Escape key was pressed on macOS. (UUM-61582)
  - Editor: Fixed an issue where the loading fallback shader threw an error when first starting the editor in GRD-enabled projects. (UUM-74172)
  - Editor: Fixed crash when a Material Variant was missing its ancestor. (UUM-77741)
  - Editor: Removed material variant creation when any material selected. (UUM-78852)
  - GI: Made baking independent of color space and added test coverage. (GFXFEAT-829)
  - Graphics: Fixed a crash when trying to clear depth targets under special circumstances. (UUM-78063)
  - Graphics: Fixed an issue where the Editor crashed when context.DrawShadows(...) had an invalid light index. (UUM-78922)
  - HDRP: Fixed an issue so light intensity now correctly increases when 'Lux at Distance' increases and vice versa. (UUM-78394)

  - HDRP: Fixed depth of field blocky artifacts when using a high blur radius. (UUM-74986)
  - HDRP: Fixed some depth of field jittering with objects in the near field and TAA enabled. (UUM-77173)
  - HDRP: PBR depth of field now has a bokeh shape that corresponds better to the aperture settings of the camera. (UUM-77172)
  - Physics: Fixed an issue where filtering data would not be properly propagated to a WheelCollider from its Rigidbody. (UUM-78024)
  - SRP Core: Added stencil flag to read-only depth logic in NRP compiler to avoid unintentional usage of depth read and stencil write states on some APIs. (UUM-79183)
  - SRP Core: Fixed potential data corruption due to incorrect native render pass store action in NRP compiler. (UUM-79181)
  - Undo System: Delayed undo diff calculations on Canvases within PrefabStage. (UUM-76366)
  - URP: Fixed some shader warnings in builds. (UUM-78471)
  - VFX Graph: Fixed corrupted graph when a custom type was missing. (UUM-69716)
