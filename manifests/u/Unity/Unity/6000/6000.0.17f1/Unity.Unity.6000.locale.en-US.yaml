  Known Issues in 6000.0.17f1
  - 2D: Crash on PopulateContacts when many collisions are made simultaneously (UUM-78661)
  - Asset - Database: Crash on MonoBehaviour::Transfer when the XR Interaction Toolkit Sample Assets are updated (UUM-76934)
  - DirectX12: Crash on BufferD3D12::BeginWrite when enabling water exclusion in the Underwater sample scene (UUM-77863)
  - DirectX12: Crash on GfxDeviceD3D12Base::DrawBuffersCommon when opening a project after changing the Graphics API to DirectX12 (UUM-77757)
  - Graphics Optimization Systems: Shader errors in DXC when building an empty URP project for Windows platform on a MacOS machine (UUM-78665)
  - Lighting: Block compression leads to lightbaking artifacts in HDRP (UUM-74735)
  - Physics 2D: A potential crash can happen when a 2D Physics contact is created and destroyed in the same simulation step.
  - SRP Core: [URP 3D Sample] Light rendering artifacts visible in Universal 3D Sample Template. It seems to be that Shader Graphs/Screen_Graph is causing the issue. Disabling objects with this material will no longer reproduce light artifacts.
    [UUM-78796] <https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/light-rendering-artifacts-visible-in-universal-3d-sample-template>
  - SRP Templates: A bunch of Shader Warnings are thrown after switching platform to Linux/Linux Server when using Universal 3D Template (UUM-76186)
  - SRP XR: Error is thrown when Shader Graph Material is changed to "Decal" (UUM-76172)
  - Visual Effects: Immortal particles disappear when editing in graph values and instancing is on (UUM-76017)
  - Vulkan: Editor crash when changing Vulkan Number of Swapchain Buffers (UUM-60016)
  6000.0.17f1 Release Notes
  Improvements
  - Editor: Improved Editor performance when performing drag, drop, copy, and paste operations with complex prefabs.
  - Graphics: Added shader pragma disable_ray_payload_size_checks that can be used in .raytrace shaders to disable ray payload size compatibility checks between ray generation and hit shaders.
  - IL2CPP: Support volatile stores using the ldind.ref opcode.
  - Physics: Added a new memory root "Physics Debugger" for tracking the memory allocated by the Physics Debugger tool.
  Changes
  - Documentation: Renamed Game Server Hosting to Multiplay Hosting as part of rebrand.
  - iOS: Use the f16 color format for the metal layer and internally by default when using "wide color" (P3 color pace).
  Fixes
  - 2D: Fixed an issue where Tile Palette window would not update when creating first palette or error messages would not show up on when it reached an error state. (UUM-77329)
  - Android: Fixed an issue with native plugin being skipped for ARMv7 architecture if target CPU is not set. (UUM-77679)
  - Android: Fixed misspelling in AndroidPluginImporterUtilities name. (UUM-77692)
  - Asset Pipeline: Increased the integrity of the asset database to minimize the risk of corruping a library folder. It changes the way we flush in-memory data to the database internally.
    Unfortunately this change might introduce a performance regression for users with spinning disk hard-drives. To accommodate this user group, we are introducing the command-line flag sacrificeDBIntegrityForPerformance, which you can use to opt out of this new behaviour and fall back to the way it has worked before. (UUM-14959)
  - Editor: Fixed a bug where a restart editor prompt appeared when users change the Incremental GC or Active Input Handling settings for inactive platforms or build profiles. (UUM-70192)
  - Editor: Fixed a ContentFile deadlock that occurred when unloading large numbers of files simultaneously. (UUM-74146)
  - Editor: Fixed a leak of Windows GDI objects when calling DisplayDialog. (UUM-76440)
  - Editor: Fixed a null exception that would occur when rendering text without settings assigned. (UUM-75106)
  - Editor: Fixed an assert that could spam the console in the Linux Editor while in Play mode if the cursor was locked and the mouse was moved quickly. (UUM-77694)
  - Editor: Fixed an Editor crash that would occur when using deferred rendering on cameras with a target render texture that fails to create, such as due to an unsupported texture format without compatible format fallbacks enabled. Now console errors are output instead. (UUM-71811)
  - Editor: Fixed an issue where errors where thrown when resizing the SceneView to 0 height or width. (UUM-76816)
  - Editor: Fixed an issue where GPU Skinning options weren't being displayed on certain platforms. (UUM-76079)
  - Editor: Fixed an issue where the grid was not visible in the Universal 2D Template project. (UUM-74314)
  - Editor: Fixed text going out of bounds when using justified alignment. (UUM-66534)
  - Editor: Fixed the location of platform build warnings in the Build Profile window. (UUM-73125)
  - Editor: Fixed the overlay highlight so it is no longer visible when the menu is closed. (UUM-62419)
  - Editor: Restored the tooltip to the View Tool button in the Tools overlay within the Scene view. (UUM-78214)
  - GI: Fixed an issue where shader variants with LIGHTMAP_ON that didn't declare DIRLIGHTMAP_COMBINED were stripped during player builds when using directional lightmapping. (UUM-68495)
  - GI: Fixed Object.Destroy() call to an existing LightProbes object to remove internal managed data properly. (UUM-69475)
  - HDRP: Set the 'Maximum Shadows on Screen' limit to 65536 in order not to exceed the maximum size of the buffer. (UUM-70329)
  - IL2CPP: Fixed an incremental GC issue when using multidimensional arrays and full generic sharing. (UUM-74630)
  - IL2CPP: Fixed for --additional-libraries flag and reworks build settings for uniformity. (UUM-71796)
  - Mono: Fixed an exception that would occur when using System.IO.Compression.BrotliStream on Android. (UUM-73753)
  - Mono: Fixed an issue where "System.Net.CookieContainer" throws an "ArgumentException" error when using a non-UTF-8 machine locale and hostname. (UUM-70240)
  - Mono: Fixed crash that occurred when accessing zip files on Linux distributions using zlin-ng (Fedora 40). (UUM-72446)
  - Particles: Fixed an issue with invisible particles when shape Arc is set to 0 and Mode is set to Loop. (UUM-78236)
  - Physics: Fixed an issue where Physics Debugger memory was being reported under default memory rather than physics memory.
  - Profiler: Fixed an error being logged the the console when hovering the BackgroundPattern element in UI Builder. (UUM-68488)
  - Profiler: Optimized profiler overhead to avoid frame time spikes during heavy load. (UUM-77998)
  - Scene Manager: Added a save modified scenes popup on exiting. (UUM-78018)
  - Scripting: Added missing attribute MustDisposeResourceAttribute in JetBrains.Annotations. (UUM-75305)
  - Scripting: Fixed remapping lists of object references in InstantiateAsync. (UUM-77930)
  - Serialization: Fixed a crash when loading ScriptableObjects or MonoBehaviours in binary-format that reference missing SerializeReference types. (UUM-75238)
  - Shadergraph: Fixed an issue where some keyboard shortcuts did not display with the correct alignment in context menus. (UUM-76115)
  - SpeedTree: Fixed an issue where .st9 models rendered with leaf-facing effect turned on unintentionally. (UUM-77419)
  - Tests: Fixed issues with gizmo picking tests causing inconsistencies.
  - TextCore: Fixed an issue where there was a missing color tag for legacy system compatibility. (UUM-72124)
  - UI Toolkit: Fixed a memory leak with the header in multi column controls. (UUM-72241)
  - UI Toolkit: Fixed a UI Builder null reference exception when switching Canvas Background modes with unsaved changes. (UUM-77085)
  - UI Toolkit: Fixed an argument exception that would occur when deleting a stylesheet with the delete key in the UI Builder when using isolation/context mode. (UUM-76826)
  - UI Toolkit: Fixed an issue where users could not drag and drop in MultiColumnTreeView when sortingMode is other than None. (UUM-68641)
  - UI Toolkit: Fixed interactive slider in samples page. (UUM-76804)
  - UI Toolkit: Fixed the flow to reparent a UI element by dragging element from hierarchy to viewport. (UUM-72987)
  - UI Toolkit: Removed dependency to com.unity.vectorgraphics in graphic tests projects. (UUM-78421)
  - UI Toolkit: Updated the background color in dark mode for the UI Builder foldouts. (UUM-76815)
  - VFX Graph: Added error feedback in case of incorrect setup of the Position Sequential Circle block. (UUM-77036)
  - WebGL: Added a way to estimate the sample count before a sound is fully loaded on WebGL. (UUM-74854)
  - WebGL: Fixed URP SSAO Medium and Low blur modes for WebGPU.
  - WebGL: [WebGPU] Fixed an issue AsyncGPUReadback and counter buffers. (UUM-78053)
