  6000.3.9f1 Release Notes
  Changes
  - Editor: Changed the Prismatic Articulation Joint type with targetVelocity set (a velocity motored prismatic articulation joint) so now setting the Target Velocity to a positive value results in a positive linear velocity during simulation. Similarly, setting the Target Velocity to a negative value will result in a negative linear velocity. (UUM-113920)
  Fixes
  - 2D: Changed the image used for as a warning icon in the Tile Palette to a higher resolution image so that it looks less blurry in the Editor. (UUM-129885)
  - 2D: Fixed issue where having a long Palette or Brush name can hide other UI elements in the Tile Palette. (UUM-130336)
  - 2D: Fixed issue where Palette and Brush dropdown changes in size when switching to other Palettes or Brushes with names of different lengths. (UUM-132618)
  - 2D: Fixed issue where the Tile Palette moves in the forward axis when it is zoomed in or out while its swizzle is set to non-XY/YX values. (UUM-133308)
  - 2D: Fixed issue with the Tile Palette window where the Split view line is not aligned with bottom view when the Tile Palette window is first shown. (UUM-129883)
  - 2D: Fixed Sprite Editor Window info box is obstructed by module's UI. (UUM-131899)
  - 2D: Truncate long Target, Palette and Brush names for Target, Palette and Brush dropdowns. (UUM-132825)

  - Android: Removed extra spaces in Android library documentation. (UUM-133945)
  - Asset Bundles: Fixed an issue where AssetBundleUnloadOperation allocations persist longer than expected and are not cleared until the next GC.collect(). (UUM-132703)
  - DX12: Fixed by allowing async compute fence waits inside render passes. (UUM-105302)
  - DX12: Fixed crashes related to scratch memory allocation. (UUM-131707)
  - DX12: Fixed crashes related to scratch memory allocation. (UUM-131824)
  - DX12: Fixed deadlock when maxQueuedFrames is 1 in the Editor when using D3D12. (UUM-131962)
  - Editor: Docked Multiplayer Play Mode window disappears when switching back to a saved Editor layout. (UUM-133602)
  - Editor: Fixed a crash in Advanced Text Generator when an ellipsis glyph was missing from the primary font. (UUM-133551)
  - Editor: Fixed a null text generation info exception. (UUM-133791)
  - Editor: Fixed an error triggered by having an open Editor Preferences tab when a file is deleted on domain reload. (UUM-133958)
  - Editor: Fixed an issue where building a player with the water sample in the project generated errors. (UUM-133713)
  - Editor: Fixed an issue where EditorUtility.CompressTexture / EditorUtility.CompressCubemapTexture would interrupt compression to signed EAC formats too late in the process, leaving the texture in a broken state. Note that signed EAC formats are not supported for compression, this has been added to the API docs.
  - Editor: Fixed an issue where the Editor became unresponsive when a modal dialog box was displayed on Windows. (UUM-132303)
  - Editor: Fixed an issue where the Replace and Cancel button positions were swapped in the iOS build dialog. (UUM-133660)
  - Editor: Fixed an issue with EditorUtility.CompressTexture / EditorUtility.CompressCubemapTexture where it was possible to attempt to compress NPOT mipmapped textures to unsupported target formats. Additional details regarding this have been added to the API docs. (UUM-129605)
  - Editor: Fixed for adp profile name foldout not able to expand by clicking its label text. (UUM-133311)

  - iOS: Keyboard UI adjusted to better fit with liquid glass. (UUM-133464)
  - Package Manager: Fixed a Windows issue where the Unity Package Manager could crash on startup when Unity was launched from a command prompt with an empty console title. (PAK-8605)
  - Physics: Fixed an issue with Rigidbody.SweepTest and Rigidbody.SweepTestAll, where the collision layer settings on the rigidbody's Collider components in cases where they would be located on child GameObjects. (UUM-91192)
  - Physics: Fixed an issue with the Cloth inspectors paint tools, where the brush wouldn't display due to no raycast being fired at the internal collision mesh. (UUM-61756)
  - Physics 2D: Fixed an issue in the debug rendering for multiple cameras to ensure accurate custom draw element lifetimes, stopping early clearing. In addition, custom draw elements are now always drawn after any automatic scene drawing. (UUM-133990)
  - Physics 2D: Fixed an issue in the debug SDF shaders for the properties "drawThickness" and "drawPointScale" so that they correctly render in pixel scales. It is recommended that you either reset the "PhysicsWorldDefinition" to its defaults or use the defaults for "drawThickness" of 1 and "drawPointScale" of 0.5. If you don't do this, you'll notice that outline rendering is slightly thicker than it was before. (UUM-133990)
  - Physics 2D: Fixed an issue with the "PhysicsRotate" property drawer showing both "Angle" and "Direction" in the inspector. This can be confusing so has been simplified to a single field of "Rotation". (UUM-133990)
  - Profiler: Fixed issue where the "frames over target" percentage shown in captures list tooltips - and the mini-highlights bar - can become out of sync with the main window's Highlights view. (UUM-120289)
  - Profiler: Fixed potential buffer overrun and crash in Profiler when adding a sample with metadata on Win32 platform. (UUM-129792)
  - Profiler: Raise Out-Of-Memory fatal error when profiler runs out of memory during data processing. (UUM-130676)

  - Text: Added ATG support for the nobr tag. (UUM-133007)
  - UI Toolkit: Fixed filters not taking DPI into account. (UUM-122745)
  - UI Toolkit: Fixed incorrect binding being used when a binding is changed and the element is moved in the hierarchy. (UUM-133584)
  - UI Toolkit: Resolved a Vulkan define redefinition error. (UUM-132686)
  - UI Toolkit: UI Toolkit: Fixed painter2D Fill() not rendering for shapes with extreme aspect ratios (e.g 36000x36).
  - URP: [Editor] Added optional terrain shader inclusion setting in URP Graphics settings. Unchecking it will prevent terrain detail shaders from being added to the build. (UUM-109540)
  - VFX Graph: Fixed an issue where branching on curve and gradient caused some unseless rebaking and upload to GPU. (UUM-129743)
  - WebGL: WebGPU: automatically handle textures that are bound to a shader for both read and write. (UUM-131864)
