  6000.0.15f1 Release Notes
  Improvements
  - GI: Added the ability to click on renderers in the Lightmap Preview window to select them in the Hierarchy.
  - UI Toolkit: Improved the navigation event handling logic for the slider.
    When the slider detects move events aligned with the slider's direction, it adjusts the slider's value. If it detects a navigation submit event, it disables the movable class on the dragger element, causing all navigation events to revert to their default behavior. A second navigation submit event re-enables the class on the dragger and restores the previous customized behavior. (UUM-75128)
  - UI Toolkit: It is now possible to adjust the MinMaxSliders values using directional navigation. The navigation submit command can be used to toggle between min value adjustment, max value adjustment and focus adjustment modes. (UUM-73854)
  API Changes
  - Editor: Deprecated: PlayerSettings.captureSingleScreen. (UUM-74786)
  - Physics: Added: Fixed 'Reuse Collision Callbacks' behaviour in CharacterController; when on it now prevents garbage generation when using the OnControllerColliderHit callback. (UUM-60515)
  Changes
  - Package Manager: Changed the label in Project Settings from Enable Pre-release Packages to Show Pre-release Package Versions.
  Fixes
  - 2D: Fixed closure of overlay menu in the Tile Palette window when the user moves the cursor over the clipboard of the Tile Palette. (UUM-75501)
  - 2D: Fixed issue where the picking marquee can be seen twice when the user picks cells in the Tile Palette initially and picks again while keeping the pointer down. (UUM-77333)
  - 2D: Fixed issue where the Tile Palette clipboard is slow to update when undocked and hovering over the SceneView window. (UUM-77045)
  - Android: Fixed Default Video Resolution for secondary orientation. The resolution is now correct when device is rotated while playing a file using the video player. (UUM-57168)
  - Android: Fixed Input.backButtonLeavesApp not working on the new input system. (UUM-41638)
  - Animation: Removed warning messages when changing the model of the Animation Preview in the Inspector. (UUM-74163)
  - Audio: Fixed an issue where Pitchfield clamping was not set to -1200 to +1200 range. (UUM-73045)
  - DX12: Fixed Editor hangs during the Material conversion process,. (UUM-77034)
  - Editor: Added Clarifying note on PBXProject.GetPBXProjectPath for VisionOS Platforms. (UUM-58830)
  - Editor: Build Profiles: Enabled editing of keystore and key alias passwords in the Build Profile window. (UUM-73323)
  - Editor: Build profiles: Fixed manual link in the inspector. (UUM-74507)
  - Editor: Fixed "CommandBuffer: temporary render texture not found while executing" warning appearing when any of the Lighting Debug Views are enabled. (UUM-74914)
  - Editor: Fixed a styling issue of Scene view Tool Settings overlay. (UUM-73434)
  - Editor: Fixed a styling issue with Scene view overlay menu. (UUM-74487)
  - Editor: Fixed an issue causing a CancellationTokenSource to be disposed twice when scanning for ADB devices. (UUM-69815)
  - Editor: Fixed an issue for deadlock after domain reload. (UUM-72710)
  - Editor: Fixed an issue on macOS where a composition string would get copied incorrectly to another text field. (UUM-75184)
  - Editor: Fixed an issue where as with other platforms show the progress dialog when exporting a package on macOS to prevent the ability to perform other actions and lead to potential crashes or duplicate exports. (UUM-72387)
  - Editor: Fixed an issue where searching for shortcuts by binding in the Shortcuts window was inconsistent. (UUM-73960)
  - Editor: Fixed an issue with Render Graph culled passes still being considered during the merge of passes. (UUM-75338)
  - Editor: Fixed excessive job allocation in ComputeShadowSplitMasksForOneLight which was causing Out Of Memory errors and lagging. (UUM-74917)
  - Editor: Fixed for Linux editor now shows up a solid black texture even though it is interactable. (UUM-77104)
  - Editor: Fixed height of MaskFieldDropdown when field value includes an option of value 0 that is not named "Nothing". (UUM-75279)
  - Editor: Fixed help icon link of "Install into source code 'build' folder" checkbox in platform settings. (UUM-76388)
  - Editor: Fixed issues with HDR rendering on XR platforms. The UI overlay texture was not being used, but was still included in HDR compositing, which results in a washed-out gray tint to the final render. (UUM-73695)

  - Editor: Increased thread priority values for Unity's realtime threads (graphics worker, job workers, etc.) to align with recommended values for realtime applications. This affects all Apple platforms (macOS, iOS, tvOS, and visionOS). This will improve frame pacing on visionOS. (XRVOSB-43)
  - Editor: Switch to FNV-1a for Render Graph. (UUM-74849)
  - HDRP: Fixed offscreen UI rendering when HDR is enabled. (UUM-60896)

  - iOS: Removed empty node from Privacy Manifest, which was potentially causing ITMS-91056: Invalid privacy manifest rejections from Apple. (UUM-77041)
  - macOS: Fixed player not re-launching when doing Build & Run when the application is already running. (UUM-75604)
  - Physics: Fixed a memory leak inside the physics debug draw logic where the filtering data would never be released.
  - Physics: Fixed an issue where calling Physics.IgnoreCollision(colA, colB) when either of the colliders is disabled, would result in the call to be ignored. (UUM-72368)
  - Physics: Fixed an issue where creating new PhysicsMaterial assets would trigger a deserialization error due to the asset type attempting to fetch the default material from PhysicsMaterialReset rather than PhysicsMaterialSmartReset. The later is normally used to access other objects during creation. (UUM-76665)
  - Scene/Game View: Fixed an issue where an exception would be thrown if MeshRenderer's material was pinged while in 'Gray' prefab context mode. (UUM-73488)
  - Scripting: Fixed Application.exitCancellationToken is called at wrong time when it is registered before the Start. (UUM-73462)
  - Shadergraph: Fixed an issue where the Custom Function node's "Body" field would expand off-screen instead of scrolling. (UUM-76270)

  - UI Toolkit: Fixed ArgumentOutOfRangeException thrown in console window using controller when selecting default choice in dropdown. (UUM-73468)
