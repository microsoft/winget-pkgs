  Known Issues in 6000.0.31f1
  - Asset - Database: "Path could not be found for script compilation file" error is thrown when the files are injected with RegisterPostInitializationOutput (UUM-86938)
  - Asset - Database: Crash on MonoBehaviour::Transfer when the XR Interaction Toolkit Sample Assets are updated (UUM-76934)
  - Build Settings Window: Application Cloud Connection Id is incorrect when using Build Profile with Player Setting Overrides. (UUM-90426)
  - DirectX12: Allocated graphics memory does not get released when the Editor is out of focus while using D3D12 graphics API (UUM-86354)
  - DirectX12: The Camera does not render correctly when the Camera.Rect() is changed and HDR is enabled and DX12 graphics API is selected (UUM-86917)
  - Editor Platform: Crash on OverridingParameterPreparer::OnPrepareVector when repeatedly saving changes made to a Shader Graph (UUM-89067)

  - Input: Crash on InputDeviceIOCTL when closing Unity editor (UUM-10774)
  - Optimization: Average FPS in Play Mode degradation on a newly created BiRP project when it's upgraded from 2020.3.48f1 to a newer Editor version (UUM-89979)
  - Packman: Unable to install ProBuilder package when project is located in an external FAT32/exFAT drive (UUM-86351)

If you have an animated SpeedTree in the shadergraph, be sure to connect an ObjectSpacePosition node to the input of the SpeedTree8Wind. If the wind node does not have an input on the ObjectSpacePosition port, the mesh will be shrunk down to a point at origin (making it seem to vanish).

  6000.0.31f1 Release Notes
  Improvements
  - Asset Import: Reduced peak memory usage at the end of Asset Importing, caused by the Bumpmap material/texture check. (UUM-88920)
  - Core: Added the ability to configure the number of asset garbage collector helper threads via command line (-gc-helper-count N) and via boot.config file (gc-helper-count=N).
  - Scripting: Awaitable methods requiring to be called from MainThread now throw an InvalidOperationException in a more reliable way instead of failing on a random internal call.

  - Asset Pipeline: Fixed an issue to handle corrupted library crash to allow the users to open their project. (UUM-14959)
  - Documentation: Updated ScriptableObject and ScriptableSingleton documentation. (UUM-84568)
  - DX12: Fixed a crash that can happen when opening a project when ray tracing effects are enabled in HDRP. (UUM-87329)
  - Editor: Fixed a perf issue with the Linux editor when using high ulimit file descriptor counts. (UUM-85386)
  - Editor: Fixed an issue where it was no longer possible to hide GameView's toolbar via editor mode. (UUM-85706)

  - Editor: Fixed Light Probe field in the Graphics Settings. (UUM-86964)
  - Editor: Fixed scene filtering not working on metal sometimes with render graph. (UUM-76465)
  - Editor: Fixed UI Toolkit Debugger to have minimum width split panes. (UUM-87428)
  - Editor: Render Graph Viewer - Fixed an issue to properly show the values for clear and bindMs. (UUM-88044)
  - Graphics: Fixed render graph passes not being fully cleared correctly at the end of the frame leading to occasional execution errors. (UUM-85333)
  - Graphics: Fixed too aggressive material property block clearing. (UUM-85970)
  - Profiler: Fixed an issue to restored the Frame to Selected functionality, bound to F, in the Standalone Profiler. (UUM-90093)
  - Scripting: Fixed an issue where "await Awaitable.MainThreadAsync" or "await Awaitable.BackgroundThreadAsync()" would have a side effect on the outermost callers when used deep in an "async Awaitable" call graph. (UUM-87426)
  - Scripting: Fixed assemblies not being included in build when using DEVELOPMENT_BUILD constraint. (UUM-84208)
  - Serialization: Fixed an issue to handle hash collisions in the TypeTreeCache. (UUM-85722)

  - UI Toolkit: Fixed the popup field handling the pointer-up event when the label was clicked. (UUM-87579)
  - Universal RP: Fixed an issue by modifing final depth copy logic to read from depth attachment instead of depth texture to avoid errors when depth texture isn't available. (UUM-85289)
  - URP: Fixed sorting the Reflection Probe by resolution. (UUM-83862)
  - Video: Fixed an Video contains artifacts issue when played in the Video Preview section in the Inspector Window. (UUM-83600)

  - Windows: On Windows, we reduced how often we re-enumerate the list of audio devices, which causes a main thread stall. If an audio output device is added or removed, but the default device does not change, then we no longer re-enumerate. If an audio input device is added or removed, we defer the re-enumerate operation until the Unity app actually requests the updated list of microphones via C#. (UUM-75603)
