  Known Issues in 6000.0.41f1
  - Analytics: [Android]Crash on lib/arm64/libil2cpp.so when Unity Analytics and Engine Code stripping are enabled (UUM-95408)
  - Android: [iOS] [UnityWebRequest] Requests with "UnityWebRequest" are open for SSL Proxying (UUM-97194)
  - Asset - Database: Crash on MonoBehaviour::Transfer when the XR Interaction Toolkit Sample Assets are updated (UUM-76934)
  - Audio Authoring: Audio Reverb Zone still produces sound when the Audio Source volume is 0 (UUM-92689)
  - DirectX12: Increased Memory usage when Update Mode 'On Demand' Realtime lights are used and DX12 API is selected (UUM-90065)
  - HDRP: Graphics Compositor breaks Unity rendering when the "Output Camera" is changed to a scene Camera and one Camera SubLayer is active.

  - Input: Touch Input is not registered correctly when using multiple displays (UUM-99077)
  - Lighting: "Draw Additional Lights Shadowmap" calls increase when custom MaterialBlockProperty is used (UUM-97309)
  - Packman: [windows only] Switching Project when importing complete project does not import all assets and project opens incomplete (UUM-88051)
  - Serialization: Crash on MonoBehaviour::VirtualRedirectTransfer when closing Editor after removing HDRP and importing Water Samples before (UUM-97847)
  - Serialization: The "UniversalRenderPipelineGlobalSettings.asset" is creating noise in the git diff when building a Player (UUM-80052)
  - Shortcut Management: Adding non-context menu item via ContextMenuUtility API can crash Editor down the line (UUM-98587)
  - SpeedTree: This release of SpeedTree includes a change to the interface of the SpeedTree8Wind shadergraph node. If you have an animated SpeedTree in the shadergraph, be sure to connect an ObjectSpacePosition node to the input of the SpeedTree8Wind. If the wind node does not have an input on the ObjectSpacePosition port, the mesh will be shrunk down to a point at origin (making it seem to vanish).
