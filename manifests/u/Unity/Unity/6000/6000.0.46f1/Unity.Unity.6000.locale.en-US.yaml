  6000.0.46f1 Release Notes
  Improvements
  - Android: -androidChainedSignalHandlerBehavior legacy never worked for GameActivity, which is expected. It's now explicitly mentioned in the documentation.
  - Build System: Improved logging for the "Read the full binlog without getting a BuildFinishedMessage" internal build error, so we can see if the build was cancelled from the editor process.
  Changes
  - Android: Add Android SDK 36 support.
  - Android: Predictive Back Support is now enabled by default on new projects.
  Fixes
  - 2D: Disable saving of default Tile Palette tools when not are set. (UUM-100964)
  - 2D: Fixed case where Inconsistent rendering of Sprite Shapes occurs when a Fill Material is not selected or a custom shader material is set as the Edge Material. (UUM-99031)
  - 2D: Fixed case where Video is not rendered in Video Player when Material Override is set as the Render Mode and a SpriteRenderer is used (UUM-98459)
  - AI: Fixed issue where collision solver for AI agents pushed agents away from stationary, non-carving obstacle center or segment midpoint, causing agents to accelerate along obstacle boundaries as they move to target locations. The effect was very obvious, especially for elongated non-square .obstacles. The collision solver now pushes agents away from nearest contact point when colliding with said obstacle. (UUM-58165)
  - Android: Added dotnet webrequest feature for auto internet access permission. (UUM-83355)
  - Android: Fixed a regression for legacy crash handler, where -androidChainedSignalHandlerBehavior legacy stopped working for Activity. Note: this legacy option will be removed in future Unity versions and you will not be able to force legacy crash handler behavior. (UUM-98269)
  - Android: Fixed dialog input field not getting dismissed after back gesture. (UUM-99637)
  - Android: Fixed potential freeze on app exit after playing streamed sounds. (UUM-96345)
  - Animation: Fix the inspector help link for the Playable Director component. (UUM-91869)
  - Audio: Fixed a crash during initialization of audio, on certain platforms where exclusive access to the output device is possible, when the default audio device driver can fail to initialize with specified parameters in the audio settings. (UUM-99985)
  - Documentation: Add docs on how to create Android Library plugin. (UUM-101538)
  - Documentation: Fixed minimum OS requirement strings for Windows on Arm devices. (UUM-98876)
  - Editor: Add binary Build Profile parsing logic. (UUM-97060)
  - Editor: Changes made to Static Emissives in Light Explorer do not add to Undo History. (UUM-83357)
  - Editor: Fixed an issue where anti-aliased handles were distorted when drawn far from origin. (UUM-100479)
  - Editor: Fixed an issue where directories with very large numbers of items and deep directory structures could cause dragging assets into a project to become sluggish and potentially freeze the Editor. (UUM-98134)
  - Editor: Fixed an issue where having multiple Scene views open would make the Scene views constantly repaint. (UUM-77750)
  - Editor: Fixed an issue where position handles still react on hover even when they are not interactive due to being positioned behind an overlay, such as the orientation gizmo. (UUM-97499)
  - Editor: Fixed an issue where the About box says license was 'Unity Indie' after returning all licenses. (UUM-84063)
  - Editor: Fixed an issue with Late binding of SpriteAtlas objects ot working when loading from content archives. (UUM-101143)
  - Editor: Fixed default preset not working outside of the scene view. (UUM-86730)
  - Editor: Fixed editor crash when performing a rect selection on a BRG that doesn't handle picking. (UUM-100239)
  - Editor: Fixed SettingsService.NotifySettingsProviderChanged() not calling OnDeactivate() for existing providers. (UUM-99153)
  - Editor: Improved External Script Editor handling of macOS application bundles. You will no longer get a warning in the console about the application not existing even though it does. (UUM-99484)
  - Editor: Modified touch position calculation to match mouse position calculation on Windows (Input.mousePosition). This fixes consistency issues between mouse and touch when in certain multi-display and multi-window scenarios. (UUM-99077)
  - Editor: Remove platforms from info which should not be available. (UUM-99218)
  - Editor: [APV] Can no longer switch baking set modes (UUM-101192)
  - Editor: [Device Simulator] Make sure to return the same value of Screen.currentResolution.refreshRateRatio.value as in Game view. (UUM-71385)
  - EmbeddedLinux: Fixed systeminfo::GetExecutableSizeMB reporting wrong values on Embedded and Desktop Linux. (UUM-66340)
  - GI: Fixed an issue where terrain trees would cast realtime shadows even after baking lighting in mixed mode. (UUM-100158)
  - Graphics: Fixed crash when using UIElements in URP with Vulkan. (UUM-100171)
  - Graphics: Fixed NullReferenceException when baking a scene with multiple APVs, terrain and trees. (UUM-101323)
  - Graphics: Fixed separate depth/stencil clears when using Vulkan. (UUM-100002)
  - Graphics: Fixed shadow culling not working for non mesh renderer types and causing unnecessary draw calls to be generated. (UUM-97309)
  - Graphics: Fixed shadows for additional lights in URP in custom shaders. (UUM-99020)
  - Graphics: Fixed warning when baking APV with zero occlusion data. (UUM-101480)
  - Installer: Fixed installer from always trying to install VC++ 2010 Redistributables. (UUM-99960)
  - macOS: Fixed bundle hashing exception that contains empty file. (UUM-84930)
  - QNX: Fixed an issue where GetExecutableSizeMB was returning garbage. (UUM-100825)
  - Scripting: Fixed losing Script dependencies in player builds when theres DefineConstrains on an Asmdef using ExtraDefines. (UUM-99127)
  - Text: Fixed unstable tooltip of TextElement due to invalid usage of textInfo in IsElided. (UUM-81536)
  - Text: Replace HashSet initializer list with Array initializer list (UUM-100735)
  - UI Toolkit: Changing an elements languageDirection will now trigger a repaint. (UUM-100620)
  - UI Toolkit: Correctly update Dynamic Atlas Viewer when UI Toolkit Debugger window is closed and reopened again. (UUM-100555)
  - UI Toolkit: Fixed an issue where the IDE would open to edit a UXML file if it was open in the UI Builder, dirty, and the user chose not to save changes. (UUM-100546)
  - UI Toolkit: Fixed corner case of inset tessellation. (UUM-100217)
  - UI Toolkit: Fixed EndLayoutGroup error sometimes showing in console when using the UI Toolkit Live Reload option. (UUM-100390)
  - UI Toolkit: Hide renderer and shader of UIDocument in inspector shown when rendering in worldspace. (UUM-99655)
  - UI Toolkit: UI Toolkit now supports tiled slicing. (UUM-92721)
  - URP: Fixed an up to 20% performance regression on Meta Quest devices that occurs in certain cases when we add a Depth Copy render pass after an Uber Post render pass. (UUM-90118)
  - URP: Fixed issue where inverse matrices were not set in XR. (UUM-75383)
  - VFX Graph: Fixed crash on mobile player builds when loading a Scene referencing a VisualEffect component but not a VfxRenderer component with the "Strip Engine Code" feature enabled. The VfxRenderer component engine code is no longer incorrectly stripped. (UUM-99927)
