  Known Issues in 6000.0.39f1
  - 3D Physics: Freeze when calling Rigidbody.SweepTestAll in a specific project (UUM-96080)
  - Android: [iOS] [UnityWebRequest] Requests with "UnityWebRequest" are open for SSL Proxying (UUM-97194)
  - Asset - Database: Crash on MonoBehaviour::Transfer when the XR Interaction Toolkit Sample Assets are updated (UUM-76934)
  - Audio Authoring: Audio Reverb Zone still produces sound when the Audio Source volume is 0 (UUM-92689)
  - DirectX12: Increased Memory usage when Update Mode 'On Demand' Realtime lights are used and DX12 API is selected (UUM-90065)
  - DOTS: URP Cascaded Shadows do not have a falloff in Player when the Player is built not in Development Mode (UUM-97415)
  - HDRP: Graphics Compositor breaks Unity rendering when the "Output Camera" is changed to a scene Camera and one Camera SubLayer is active.

  - Scripting Runtime: Crash on UnityEditor.AssetDatabase:StopAssetEditing when removing HDRP Package after having imported Water Samples (UUM-78164)
  - Serialization: Crash on MonoBehaviour::VirtualRedirectTransfer when closing Editor after removing HDRP and importing Water Samples before (UUM-97847)
  - Serialization: The "UniversalRenderPipelineGlobalSettings.asset" is creating noise in the git diff when building a Player (UUM-80052)
  - SpeedTree: This release of SpeedTree includes a change to the interface of the SpeedTree8Wind shadergraph node. If you have an animated SpeedTree in the shadergraph, be sure to connect an ObjectSpacePosition node to the input of the SpeedTree8Wind. If the wind node does not have an input on the ObjectSpacePosition port, the mesh will be shrunk down to a point at origin (making it seem to vanish).

  - Text: TMP 'Bold' Font Style is rendered with incorrect Font when a Font Asset without Bold typeface is selected (UUM-97382)

  6000.0.39f1 Release Notes
  Improvements
  - Shadergraph: Added a new set of sample content - Shader Graph UGUI Shaders - to the Shader Graph package that contains examples of how to use the new Canvas target in Shader Graph to create dynamic UI elements. This new sample can be imported from the Sample tab of the Package Manager after selecting the Shader Graph package
  Fixes
  - 2D: Fixed TilemapRenderer in SRPBatch mode from applying Tilemap Color twice when rendering Tiles. (UUM-92738)
  - Animation: Fixed an issue by adding a minimum width to the Layers and Parameters panel in the Animator Controller window. (UUM-95501)
  - Animation: Fixed AnimatorControllerPlayable bug causing bindings rebuild on state transition. (UUM-95943)
  - Asset Import: Fixed a deadlock and memory leaks in unwrapCL. (UUM-66897)
  - Asset Pipeline: Fixed a crash that could occur when script with scriptable object is moved and there hasn't been a domain reload, and scriptable object is used for write serialization. When fixing this bug, it was also discovered that rename would cause similar crash. It was also discovered that managed plugins also had problems with performing write serialization when moved/renamed - but didn't cause a crash. (UUM-75114)
  - Audio: Fixed an isseu with an Audio Source on Game Object with one or more Audio Effects potentially never becoming non-virtual (inaudible). (UUM-91256)
  - Audio: Fixed an issue that would cause a bunch of warnings to be logged in the console when playing an audio clip through a playable graph. (UUM-83860)
  - Editor: Fixed a crash when calling 'HasProperty' on a MaterialVariant with a missing ancestor. (UUM-91723)
  - Editor: Fixed a SpriteAtlasImporter issue where texture platform settings for certain platforms (such as iOS) did not apply correctly and could not be edited through the inspector or relevant APIs. (UUM-90066)
  - Editor: Fixed an instance where the editor would crash on start up if Overlays save data was corrupted. (UUM-96961)
  - Editor: Fixed an issue where attempting to reset the QualitySettings would cause the editor to crash if they contained 1 or more Texture Mipmap Limit Groups. (UUM-91590)
  - Editor: Fixed an issue where rhe inspector window preview area dragline anchor was visible when it was not supposed to be. Additionally, the minimum height of the content area is now set to a non-zero value to prevent it from collapsing to nothing. (UUM-93306)
  - Editor: Fixed an issue where sprite flipbook shadows using sprite shadows were not correctly updating (UUM-74689)
  - Editor: Fixed an issue where the Gizmos and Layers menu opens and then closes and immediately reopens when you click the dropdown. (UUM-91078)
  - Editor: Fixed an issue where the macOS player settings was not showing in build profile when on non-matching OS editor. (UUM-93341)
  - Editor: Fixed an issue where the prefab editor was ignoring gameobject structure changes such as adding or removing a component. (UUM-72378)
  - Editor: Fixed an issue where the scene saving prompt did not appear when opening another scene while in Play Mode. (UUM-69486)
  - Editor: Fixed an issue where visionOS XR apps would only render to the left eye when using MSAA and RenderGraph. (UUM-95617)
  - Editor: Fixed an issue with the TextureImporter.GetAutomaticFormat API where it would return an unexpected format if the provided platform name referred to a platform for which the build support module was not installed. (UUM-95944)
  - Editor: Fixed an issue with the TextureImporter.GetAutomaticFormat API where it would return an unexpected format if the provided platform name referred to certain platforms (such as iOS). (UUM-93298)

  - Physics: Fixed PhysX error "Failed to create Convex Mesh from source mesh" from being thrown when looking around the Scene View while having the Physics Debug tab open. (UUM-93081)
  - Scene/Game View: Fixed an issue where Shortcut Manager would not alert the user when attempting to binding shortcuts containing reserved modifiers. (UUM-90584)
