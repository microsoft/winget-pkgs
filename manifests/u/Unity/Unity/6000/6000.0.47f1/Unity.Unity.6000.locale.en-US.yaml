  6000.0.47f1 Release Notes
  Improvements
  - 2D: Allow users to set an alpha tolerance value when generating a custom physics shape from the Sprite Editor (UUM-101609)
  - Build Pipeline: Better support for cancellation when using Multi-Process AssetBundle building. In some cases the progress bar would not respond if active imports failed to complete. With this fix the build can be cancelled and any incomplete imports will be logged. (CBD-1101)
  - Core: Don't sync job chains early.
  Fixes
  - 2D: Fixed an issue where Editor crashes on PrepareSpriteTilingData when exiting Play mode. (UUM-101315)
  - 2D: Fixed Sprite Editor Window settings text alignment in Preference Window. (UUM-100716)
  - Android: Fixed incorrect BGR color channel swizzle when playing VP8 videos on Android while using Vulkan as Graphics API. (UUM-90144)
  - Animation: Fixed copy and paste for animation properties contextual menu. (UUM-98400)
  - Audio: Audio Clips with loadInBackground set would always play back with default values for spatialBlend and stereoPan on the first frame of playback. (UUM-84289)
  - Audio: Fixed an issue that would cause the pitch shifter audio effect to sometimes distort the audio. (UUM-95664)
  - Editor: Fixed a crash if EditorSettings is attempted to be unloaded from managed. (UUM-97159)
  - Editor: Fixed a crash when class id in scene file does not match expected type e.g. Component as GameObject. (UUM-91352)
  - Editor: Fixed an issue so the console no longer displays "Missing APV data asset. Please make sure that the lighting has been baked properly." when baking APV data and volume occlusion data is not created during baking. (UUM-86553)
  - Editor: Fixed an issue where TransformAccessArray.Add APIs acted consistently when passed null Transforms or invalid InstanceIds. They will add the null entry and print a warning to the console. (UUM-70574)
  - Editor: Fixed crash on "SerializedObject::ApplyModifiedPropertiesWithoutUndo()" when changing the Color Space setting. (UUM-101482)
  - Editor: Fixed custom gizmo rendering that loads textures causing crashes in URP. Gizmos are now rendered from an unsafe pass in URP. (UUM-99992)
  - Editor: Fixed errors related to incompatible keyword spaces when loading a project using ray tracing shaders. The errors can be generated when using closest hit shaders and keywords in a fallback shader. (UUM-98620)
  - Editor: Fixed VFX help urls for RandomSelector, VFXAttributeParameter and SampleWaterSurface. (UUM-100871)
  - Editor: Stop the Editor from causing macOS to prompt for access for any and all directories that recently opened projects exist in. Even if it they do not contain the project that is being opened. (UUM-100637)
  - GI: Fixed an issue where baked shadows would be missing in URP when realtime shadows were disabled. (UUM-98838)
  - Graphics: Fixed a rare BRG related crash that happened when Meshes were being unregistered before they were used.
  - Graphics: Fixed crash in Vulkan Editor when texture uploads happen during an active render pass. (UUM-100009)
  - Graphics: Fixed incorrect assignment of ColorWriteMask on Metal when using RenderGraph. (UUM-101569)
  - HLSLcc: Fixed an issue where the int variable's data type was assumed to be a uint and not explicitly checked before attempting to be used with uintBitsToFloat. (UUM-100116)
  - IL2CPP: Fixed engine module test assemblies potentially be stripped away entirely. (UUM-86462)
  - Input System: Fixed an issue where the macOS HID input backend would send HID output reports (rumble haptics) synchronously resulting in reduced FPS when HID output reports are not matching the expected format. (UUM-101166)
  - Package Manager: Fixed an issue where Package Manager registration events (registeredPackages, registeringPackages) were not triggered when changing the package registry. (UUM-102231)
  - Profiler: Improved managed methods information for profiler callstacks on il2cpp scripting backend. (UUM-27914)
  - Scripting: Disable ExecutionContext capture when wiring up cancellation of Awaitables. (UUM-101626)
  - Scripting: Fixed AsyncInstantiate continuing unfinished operations after exiting playmode. (UUM-77619)
  - Serialization: Fixed DataEquals of SerializedProperty returning false in some cases where refReferenceId & otherReferenceId are having a garbage value making the refManagedReferenceTypeTree & otherManagedReferenceTypeTree null and corrupting the serialized data. (UUM-88925)
  - Serialization: In 2021.x Fixed Timestep was serialized as a float. It was switched to IntegerTime::RationalTime, but was missing a migration for the older values. This would show up as the Fixed Timestep being reset to the default value. This should now be properly converted. (UUM-91212)
  - Shadergraph: Fixed an issue where changing Enum Keyword entries (names or values) or re-ordering them would not set the graph as dirty and could lead to changes not saved. (UUM-91041)
  - Shadergraph: Fixed an issue where copy/pasting a property from a Graph to a Subgraph would make it display Graph only settings. (UUM-91040)
  - Shadergraph: Fixed an issue where unchecking "Show In Inspector" would set the property to Global scope the first time. (UUM-83804)
  - Shaders: Fixed an editor crash in shader fallback resolving when importing a specific bundle of assets. (UUM-99172)
  - SRP Core: Fixed Transient Resources support in Native RenderPass Render Graph (used in URP). (UUM-90205)
  - Text: Mark color selection API as obsolete (UUM-98451)
  - Text: Update Freetype to version 2.13.3 (UUM-102460)
  - UI Toolkit: Fixed an issue where overriding a binding and reparenting would keep the previously registered binding. (UUM-101504)
  - UI Toolkit: Fixed an issue where the ColorField no longer shows a vestigial progress indication when the alpha is set 0. (UUM-101231)
  - UI Toolkit: Fixed missing synchronization that triggered assertion failures in UpdateBufferRanges. (UUM-101410)
  - UI Toolkit: UI Toolkit now warns you that UI elements might not render correctly if you disable depth and stencil. (UUM-98899)
  - VFX Graph: Fixed an issue with Undo/Redo while changing ShaderGraph reference. (UUM-97849)
  - VFX Graph: Fixed an unexpected destructive workflow with null SRP asset in case of SG/VFX Output usage. (UUM-101634)
  - Web: Fixed an issue to corrected the name of the background image file in the output directory when using "Name Files as Hashes". (UUM-96178)
  - Windows: Fixed a few related issues where if the Unity project/player settings were set to the Quad speaker mode, we would still output sound to the front center channel on a 5.1 or 7.1 system. Similarly, if Unity is set to use the surround (5.0) speaker mode, we would still output sound to the LFE channel on a 5.1 or 7.1 system. This has now been fixed. (UUM-52906)
