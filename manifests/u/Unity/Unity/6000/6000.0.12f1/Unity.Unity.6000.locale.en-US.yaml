  - Asset Bundles: The resource is not properly referenced when there is a dependency on another asset bundle (UUM-74871)
  - Kernel: Profiler does not profile after building the Project with Autoconnect Profiler Option enabled (UUM-71750)
  - Kernel: VirtualFileSystem crash because of data races. (UUM-72557)
  - Lighting: Block compression leads to lightbaking artifacts in HDRP (UUM-74735)
  - Material: Crash on SourceAssetDBReadTxn::SourceAssetDBReadTxn when opening a project after deleting an Asset (UUM-75191)
  - PhysX Integration: A 1000 times heavier GameObject will stutter when colliding with a lighter GameObject (UUM-65366)
  - Serialization: Crash on TypeTreeQueries::GetFullTypeNameFromReferencedType when an xoJunction GameObject is selected in the Hierarchy Window (UUM-74373)

  6000.0.12f1 Release Notes
  Improvements
  - Graphics: Allowed performing a Submit of Render Request from RenderPipelineManager callbacks.
  - Physics 2D: Removed invalid sentence in Scripting documentation for the Collider2D.Overlap methods that accept a List<T> as an argument.
  Changes
  - AI: NavMeshBuilder.CollectSources() can now return only the physics objects that are within a volume extending 1e9 units in all 3 dimensions.
  Fixes
  - 2D: Fixed Gem Hunter sample not working on iOS Simulator. (UUM-74000)
  - Android: AndroidApplication.onConfigurationChanged will reuse AndroidConfiguration instance for sequential calls, if you want to cache configuration instance, use AndroidConfiguration.CopyFrom function. (UUM-75092)
  - Android: Location Services will now resume (if it is enabled) automatically when app is paused or resumed.
  - Android: Reworked Input.location so it now work with GameActivity. (UUM-74113)
  - DX12: Fixed a GPU crash by unbind counter resources. (UUM-75100)
  - Editor: Clear culling cache results before rendering selection outlines. (UUM-69725)
  - Editor: Fixed an editor crash during import when the project has a saved layout of an open build profile window. (UUM-73189)
  - Editor: Fixed an issue that would cause a crash when the Editor was exited when GLES is the active graphics API. (UUM-54445)
  - Editor: Fixed an issue with RenderRaph API so when a pass modifies the global rendering state, we should prevent it from being culled. (UUM-73906)
  - Editor: Fixed issue with Window/Panels menu items. (UUM-74640)
  - Editor: Fixed registration error being thrown when a UxmlElement has the same name as the class. (UUM-73716)
  - Editor: Updated the sliders in the ARC window so that users can see visually when the randomisation range is being clipped. (UUM-50343)
  - Graphics: Bursted culling input creation in OnPerformCulling with GPUResidentDrawer to improve performances. (UUM-75306)
  - Graphics: Fixed an issue that caused an error and shader to not load and render with GPUResidentDrawer. (UUM-75298)
  - Graphics: Fixed an issue where DBuffer decals where not applied before sampling GI. (UUM-34259)
  - Graphics: Fixed crash when using SRP, Handle.DrawOutline() and filtering the hierarchy. (UUM-67677)
  - Graphics: Now correctly handle unsupported shaders on resource change with GPUResidentDrawer. (UUM-75302)
  - HDRP: Allowed TAAU, CAS, and STP to execute after the DoF or after all the post-processes like the other advanced upsamplers. (UUM-75530)
  - Kernel: Optimized job allocator with memory synchronization fix to avoid freezes. (UUM-73194)
  - macOS: Fixed an issue where resolution not resetting to full screen when going to full-screen window by using native MacOS UI controls. (UUM-73633)
  - Particles: Fixed a freeze that occurs if user particle system jobs are completed immediately after schedule. (UUM-74409)
  - Profiler: Fixed a Memory Profiler issue that could cause the total size of a memory root to differ slightly from the sum of its individually reported allocations, as allocation header bytes and unused/fragmentation bytes could be included. (UUM-75352)
  - Scripting: Fixed issue with an InstantiateAsync which does not invoke OnAfterDeserialize after the prefab was instantiated in Editor. (UUM-71810)
  - SRP Core: Avoid that the same volume can be registered more than 1 time in the VolumeManager. (UUM-70658)
  - SRP Core: Fixed crash caused by indirect argument buffer being one item too small. (UUM-73969)
  - UI Toolkit: Added an auto-generated tag to UxmlElement and UxmlObject generated code. (UUM-75492)
  - UI Toolkit: Disabled template UxmlObject fields in the UI Builder. Attribute overrides do not currently support UxmlObjects. (UUM-72789)
  - UI Toolkit: Fixed an issue where setting a field with showMixedValue would cause it to revert to the previous value. (UUM-73855)
  - UI Toolkit: Fixed exception when viewing template UxmlObject attributes in the UI Builder. (UUM-75608)
  - URP: Fixed a shader compilation error on Apple platforms without Metal. (UUM-75548)
