  - Asset - Database: Crash on MonoBehaviour::Transfer when the XR Interaction Toolkit Sample Assets are updated (UUM-76934)
  - Audio Authoring: Audio Source clip is not audible when exceeding a high number of active Audio Sources (UUM-91256)

  - DirectX12: Allocated graphics memory does not get released when the Editor is out of focus while using D3D12 graphics API (UUM-86354)
  - DirectX12: The Camera does not render correctly when the Camera.Rect() is changed and HDR is enabled and DX12 graphics API is selected (UUM-86917)
  - Editor Platform: Crash on OverridingParameterPreparer::OnPrepareVector when repeatedly saving changes made to a Shader Graph (UUM-89067)
