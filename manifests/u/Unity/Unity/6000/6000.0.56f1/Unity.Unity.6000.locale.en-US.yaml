  6000.0.56f1 Release Notes
  Features
  - Android: Added app category support - Allows users to retain Android 15 orientation and rotation behavior on Android 16.
  Improvements
  - iOS: Added support for CAMetalDisplayLink. It is enabled by default on ios (when built with xcode15+ and run ios17+). It can be overriden at runtime by tweaking/overriding [UnityAppController shouldUseMetalDisplayLink] method. By default it is disabled on tvos, since most of them are slow, and failing to catch up with target FPS (on complex scenes) will result in confusing GPU hang messages. (UUM-66493)
  Fixes
  - 2D: Fixed issue where the material property block of a SpriteRenderer is reset when the SpriteRenderer is updated through an Animation clip. (UUM-111921)
  - Animation: Added warnings when optimizing a Transform hierarchy which has duplicate transform names, as that can cause issues when Deoptimizing the hierarchy. (UUM-104605)
  - Animation: Ensure that an Animator using an AnimationClipPlayable will keep playing when its clip is reimported while in Play Mode. (UUM-100557)
  - Animation: Fixed an issue where reimporting an AnimationClip that was playing in the AnimationWindow would stop playing the clip. (UUM-103354)
  - Animation: Fixed an issue where the Animator transition preview graph would create visual artifacts when zooming in and out. (UUM-113328)
  - Animation: Fixed issue where creating a state from a new clip could fail with an exception if a BlendTree was selected in the inspector. (UUM-113046)
  - Animation: Fixed issue where no icon would be shown when importing an AnimatorOverrideController asset from a UnityPackage. (UUM-110290)
  - Animation: Fixed issue where Object Reference fields in UI Toolkit inspectors would not get the red tint applied to them. (UUM-113352)
  - Animation: Fixed issue where pressing the delete key on the root node of a blend tree would produce an invalid deletion prompt. (UUM-107479)
  - Animation: Fixed issue where the foldouts for the avatar mask inspector would not keep their configuration. (UUM-107481)
  - Animation: Fixed issue where the selection in the layer list of the Animator Window would not match the selected layer after a drag and drop reorder of the layers. (UUM-110368)
  - Animation: Fixed issue where thresholds would not be correctly automatically calculated after deleting a source motion from a blend tree. (UUM-107494)
  - Build Pipeline: Fixed an issue where calling AssetBundle.Unload(false) on a bundle containing a texture that was already loaded would make it unreadable. (UUM-112637)
  - DX12: Added debug layer message callbacks for saving validation errors in log files. (UUM-113937)
  - DX12: Allow to run without validation layer if its not installed on the user's machine. (UUM-113478)
  - DX12: Fixed a crash when FSR2 from AMDUnityPlugin is toggled on/off. (UUM-100044)
  - Editor: Fixed a bug where terrain with GPU instancing enabled would not render in the Scene view when using one of the debug visualization modes. (UUM-109468)
  - Editor: Fixed artifacts in console window when using Log Entry = 1 with an empty string. (UUM-112357)

  - Editor: Fixed Windows Editor command line launch issue when there is a -logfile arg with no log file path after. (UUM-112532)
  - Editor: Hide ellipsis menu for floating material preview window. (UUM-111197)
  - Editor: No longer assert in the Editor when calling InstantiateAsync on a prefab that contains a sub emitter. (UUM-112023)
