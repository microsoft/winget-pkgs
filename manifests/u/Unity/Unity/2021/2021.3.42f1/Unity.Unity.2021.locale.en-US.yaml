  2021.3.42f1 Release Notes
  Improvements
  - Graphics: Add a IUnityXRTextureManagerInterface and a function pointer OnTextureDestroyed in it, which is called when VR RenderTexture is destroyed. On the plugin side, a callback assigned to this pointer is going to get triggered.
  - XR: Update XR Interaction Toolkit package (com.unity.xr.interaction.toolkit) to v2.6.3
  Changes
  - Android: Updated bundletool up to 1.16.0 (UUM-70552)
  - Burst: Improved error message for pointer-like types in non-readonly static fields
  - Burst: Improved performance of Burst-compiled code in the Windows x64 Editor by only emitting context-saving code when the code being compiled contains a throw
  - Package: Updated code coverage package to version 1.2.6
  Fixes
  - Android: Add UI for creating a custom settings.gradle template (UUM-27109)
  - Android: Correctly replace DIR_UNITYPROJECT in settingsTemplate.gradle (UUM-27090)

  - Burst: Creating a project with a space in the path would cause burst to fail on windows arm64.
  - Burst: Fixed an issue with default interface methods which would result in compiler errors due to IL corruption.
  - Burst: Fixed another compiler crash caused by faulty alias analysis
  - Burst: Fixed direct negation of enums was not correctly promoting the underlying type, causing wrong results.
  - Burst: Fixed that Mathf.Approximately would return the wrong result approximately all of the time

  - Graphics: Fixed use frustum culling light setting to work for shadow cascades. (UUM-56026)
  - Graphics: The condition for the "Graphics.CopyTexture with a region will not copy readable texture data for compressed formats" warnings has been fixed to match the documentation so that when a CPU copy would not normally be attempted (ie., at least one texture is not readable), the warnings will not appear. (UUM-73721)
  - HDRP: Fixed graphical issue when resizing Reflection Probe sizes on macOS (UUM-71467)
  - IL2CPP: Fix incremental GC issue when using multidimensional arrays and full generic sharing.
