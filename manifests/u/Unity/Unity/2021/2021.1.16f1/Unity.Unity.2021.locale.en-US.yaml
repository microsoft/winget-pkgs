  Features
  - Android: Users can include custom asset packs into the build, by adding assets to the directory ending with '.androidpack'.
  - Android: When building Android App Bundle with Split App Binary enabled, Unity will create asset packs.

  Improvements
  - Virtual Texturing: Tile requests are now returned via PopRequests more frequently.
  - Virtual Texturing: InvalidateRegion calls now generate new tile requests in their "importance" order. The importance is defined as a combination of the tile's screen space size and the the number of frames since the tile has been requested. This makes completing tile requests contribute more to the rendering result when InvalidateRegion is called continuously.
  - XR: Updated OpenXR package to 1.2.3
  - The Package Manager’s global cache root folder, which is used to store downloaded packages, can now be configured using the UPM_CACHE_ROOT environment variable or the cacheRoot key in the user configuration file

  API Changes
  - Android: Added: New APIs to manage fast-follow and on-demand delivered asset packs. The APIs wrap Google's PlayCore functionality.

  Changes
  - Android: Gradle Plugin version upgraded from 3.6.0 to 4.0.1.
  - Android: Gradle version upgraded from 5.6.4 to 6.1.1.
  - Timeline: Updated Timeline package version to 1.5.6
  - Virtual Texturing: Now PopRequests allows the destination list to have a different size than the texture stack's maxActiveRequests value.

  Fixes
  - AI: Fixed an issue where the NavMesh was generated over a mesh marked as "Not Walkable". (1109195)
  - Asset Bundles: Fixed an issue where Texture Importer Inspector was no longer throwing errors when built-in texture inspector was overwritten. (1317450)
  - Asset Import: Fixed an issue where data in the Assets\StreamingAssets folder was being cached by the Unity Accelerator. (1295717)
  - Asset Pipeline: Fixed an issue where searching in the object selector would for some searches only show icons even if previews could be shown. (1309396)
  - Core: Fixed a message "Connection is no longer valid.Calling auto disconnect" issue. (1336988)
  - Editor: Fixed a InspectorWindow repaint regression between 2017.4 and 2019.4. (1320675)
  - Editor: Fixed an issue when running in Device Simulator, Touch.tapCount would no longer increased when taps happen in every frame. (1258166)
  - Editor: Fixed an issue where Command+Backspace was not deleting elements from reorderable arrays. (1329602)
  - Editor: Fixed an issue where the icon selector window did not close on selection undo. (1305625)
  - Editor: Fixed an issue where there more than one click was necessary to interact with game objects in play mode when clicking between multiple game views. (1327556)
  - Editor: Fixed an issue with context-click for reorderable lists in the mac editor. (1313317)
  - GI: Fixed ''PPtr cast failed when dereferencing! Casting from ScriptMapper to Texture!' when baking a second Reflection Probe in the Scene. (1317164)
  - Graphics: Fixed a hang when loading a texture from AssetBundles in the Editor that were built for other platforms. (1286994)
  - Graphics: Fixed an iAttachmentDescriptor.ConfigureResolveTarget() screen flip issue when resolving to backbuffer. (1327936)
  - Graphics: Fixed an issue when dynamic scaling was enabled and a Render Target was attached to a Camera the ScreenTo and ToScreen functions would no longer use the scaled viewport size, instead match the behaviour when a Render Target wasn't attached as per the documentation. (1329240)
  - Graphics: Fixed an issue where canvas was not rendering on the secondary screen, when there was no Cameras rendering to it too. (1340327)
  - Graphics: Fixed an issue where Encoding RFloat and RHalf to PNG, JPG or TGA would not encodes to a grayscale image. (1325643)
  - HDRP: Fixed an issue where an enabled GPU Instancing on a ShaderGraph Material would cause compile failures. (1338695)
  - HDRP: Fixed an issue where RenderGraph was missing support of motion vector.
  - HDRP: Fixed an issue with velocity rejection when using physically-based DoF.
  - Networking: Fixed an issue where the web request wasn't released incase of redirect to avoid memory leak.
  - Package Manager: Fixed a Not resolved variable found --icon-info console error.
  - Package Manager: Fixed an issue where function call traces from upm.log file were not removed. (1331947)
  - Package Manager: Fixed an issue where removing a project dependency using PackageManager.Client.Remove would throw an error when the project manifest has no dependencies property. (1324067)
  - Physics: Fixed an issue where Physics2D.SetLayerCollisionMask was not correctly updating all layers that had changed. (1345964)
  - Physics: Fixed an issue where the SurfaceEffector2D interact with 2D Trigger Colliders. (1337537)

  - Profiler: Fixed an issue in the System.Thread threads tracking and visualization in Timeline view of Profiler Window. (1339407)
  - Scripting: Fixed a crash when closing the editor after a failed AssetBundle.LoadFromStreamAsync operation. (1331280)
  - Scripting: Fixed an issue when including UIElements or Ui Builder packages, which could lead to errors when debug/release mode were changed.
    The error could also appear if changing a setting that would get the packages recompiled. (1314920)
  - Shadergraph: Fixed an issue with GPU instancing support in Shadergraph. (1319655)
  - UI Toolkit: Fixed a precision errors in gamma-linear conversions. (1317742)
  - UI Toolkit: Fixed an issue where a panel remained unresponsive to user interactions even if it contains elements with huge dimensions. (1324728)
  - URP: Fixed an issue where the SRP batcher was not working on OpenGL.
  - Virtual Texturing: Fixed an issue where a completed request not be incorrectly canceled if the last InvalidateRegion call was made before PopRequests.
