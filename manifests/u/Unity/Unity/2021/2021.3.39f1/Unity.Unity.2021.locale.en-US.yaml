  2021.3.39f1 Release Notes
  Features
  - macOS: Added Apple Privacy Manifests support for macOS.
  Changes

  - Editor: Treating RenderSettings.m_IndirectSpecularColor as volatile data. (UUM-46853)

To account for special characters and regex that may be present in the user jspre code (see UUM-21896), the final parameter uses a anonymous delegate function to treat the replacement string as a string literal so that it is not processed in any way.
