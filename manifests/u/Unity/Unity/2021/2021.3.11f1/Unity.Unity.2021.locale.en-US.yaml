  Improvements

  - 2D: [com.unity.2d.animation] Added bone weight index validation in SpriteSkin's validate method, to ensure valid data before continuing with deformation.
  - 2D: [com.unity.2d.animation] Updated Toolbar and Visibility tab buttons' selection color.
  - 2D: [com.unity.2d.common] Added support for different sized texture inputs in ImagePacker.
  - 2D: [com.unity.2d.psdimporter] Improved import speed and memory allocation for psd/psb files by reducing the intermediate texture buffers.
