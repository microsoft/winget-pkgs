  Features

  - Android: Added build_fingerprint information to android builds.

  Improvements

  - Editor: Reduced time to rebuild the CreateAsset(...) menu during a domain reload, it previously was scaling badly for projects with many assemblies.
  - Multiplayer: Added Netcode for GameObjects 1.2.0.
  - Networking: Clarified error message in the logs when attempting to build a dedicated server player without having that platform's corresponding Dedicated Server Build support module installed. (UUM-22128)
  - Particles: Don't call OnParticleTrigger when there are no trigger module events to report. (Optimization). ("UUM-19111")

  API Changes

  - Scripting: Added: New Object.FindFirstObjectByType() and Object.FindAnyObjectByType() functions added as potentially faster alternatives to Object.FindObjectOfType().  These new functions let you decide whether you must have the first (lowest InstanceID) object found or if any instance is adequate.  In the latter case the function can be many times faster as no internal sorting is required.  See the scripting documentation for both functions for more details.
  - Scripting: Added: New Object.FindObjectsByType() function added as a potentially faster alternative to Object.FindObjectsOfType().  This new function gives users the choice whether or not to perform the expensive sorting by InstanceID on the returned collection of objects rather than having it always performed wasting time when unnecessary.  See the scripting documentation for Object.FindObjectsByType() and Object.FindObjectsOfType() for more details.
  - Version Control: Removed: Removed Collab and its dependency from the package.

  Changes

  - 2D: Com.unity.template.2d - Remove com.unity.ide.vscode from template because it is deprecated.
  - 2D: Com.unity.template.universal-2d - Remove com.unity.ide.vscode from template because it is deprecated.

  Fixes

  - Android: Fixed build failing when app bundle option is enabled and output file has no extension. ("UUM-10941")
  - Android: Fixed mapping file output failure when destination folder doesn't exist. ("UUM-9368")
  - Android: Free persistent surface view when it's no longer used after activity resume. (UUM-2481)
  - Android: PermissionCallbacks.DeniedAndDontAskAgain is no longer invoked on Android 11 and later. Use Denied instead on all versions. ("UUM-20936")
  - Android: Warn user if both template file and disabled template file exists in project. ("UUM-19338")
  - Asset Pipeline: Asset Pipeline: Asset Import: Elided asset import paths using ellipsis on the import dialogue if the path length exceeds maximum text width. (UUM-3657)
  - Editor: Camera relative culling options have been added to the Graphics section in Project Settings. This will potentially alleviate light popping issues due to lack of precision when the objects or lights are far from the origin. Enabling the camera relative culling setting for lights will potentially introduces issues for objects or lights that are far from the camera origin. ("UUM-7551")
  - Editor: Fixed a memory leak which would manifest when loading then unloading scenes additively. ("UUM-18684")
  - Editor: Fixed a problem where a failed Unity Linker invocation may cause subsequent builds to fail with "Sequence contains no elements". (UUM-18372)
  - Editor: Fixed duplicate EditorApplication.update delegates being registered when changing editor layout. ("UUM-12847")
  - Editor: Fixed OnValidate callback is called twice when entering Prefab Mode in Context. ("UUM-17190")
  - Editor: Fixed Profiler samples in the VFX category to contribute towards the Rendering Category instead of Others. (UUM-2166)
  - Editor: SpeedTree: Materials selection GUI is now enabled for Mesh Renderer components in the Inspector window. (UUM-22569)
  - GI: Fixed issue where baking a single reflection probe could result in the wrong cubemap being associated with the wrong probe. ("UUM-20194")
  - Graphics: Avoid memory corruption when async readback destination NativeArray is too small. Instead the readback fails. ("UUM-12422")
  - Graphics: Fixed Texture2D.UpdateExternalTexture not working on Vulkan. ("UUM-20405")
  - HDRP: Enabled evaluation of stacked area lights in the path tracer. (UUM-18897)
  - HDRP: Fixed an issue where calling HDCamera.Reset() would not reset internal frame count of individual sky and cloud renderers. ("UUM-19077")
  - HDRP: Fixed an issue with new scene being created with bad directional light. (UUM-8321)
  - HDRP: Fixed enabling raytracing in the HDRP asset if resources are in a bad state. (UUM-18728)
  - HDRP: Fixed forward materials with motion vectors rendered twice.
  - HDRP: Fixed motion blur issues caused on fast movements. ("UUM-19339")
  - HDRP: Fixed performance when using low quality shadows.
  - HDRP: Fixed stripping on shadergraph depth prepass. (UUM-17613)
  - HDRP: Fixed volumetric clouds disappearing. (UUM-20244)
  - IL2CPP: Enabled the marshaling offset to compute properly for the first field in an explicit layout type when that field has a non-zero offset. ("UUM-19622")
  - IL2CPP: Removed caching of assemblies when probing directories in the linker. (UUM-17887)
  - Mono: Added use of a relative path to the gdiplus dynamic library in the dllmap entry in the config file. ("UUM-20719")
  - Mono: Fixed an issue where the internal debugger would refuse connections after performing multiple switches between release and debug editor runtime optimizations. ("UUM-16704")
  - Particles: Fixed erroneous error message: "all(sheetIndexNormalized Markdig.Syntax.Inlines.HtmlEntityInline= 0.0f) Markdig.Syntax.Inlines.HtmlEntityInlineMarkdig.Syntax.Inlines.HtmlEntityInline all(sheetIndexNormalized Markdig.Syntax.Inlines.HtmlEntityInline= 1.0f)". (UUM-23304)
  - Physics 2D: Fixed a bug where a Rigidbody2D without interpolation using MovePosition per-frame could result in a memory leak.
  - Profiler: Fixed saving and loading of Profiler Data when the frame range contains frames that have been gathered from different different targets (e.g. from Playmode and from a built Player). Previously saved .data files with such data are irreparably corrupted and will crash on opening. This fix only applies to data saved from this version onwards. ("UUM-14767")
  - Scene/Game View: Fixed overlapped UI elements not being picked based on the order they are rendered. ("UUM-18939")
  - Serialization: Fixed issue where de-serializing Prefab containing a SerializeReference which has been refactored not handles MovedFrom. Improved AssetDatabase script type dependency so that if a missing SerializeReference instance type, re-appears importers depending on it will be trigerred. ("UUM-6733")
  - Shaders: Fixed a crash when loading shaders that are incompatible with the current hardware due to resource limits. ("UUM-21964")
  - Shaders: RenderingCommandBuffer.EnableKeyword(material, keyword) now properly affects rendering. (UUM-21676)
  - UI: Fixed a crash could occur when the inspector window is rendering the header in IMGUI (case 1359247).
  - UI Toolkit: Fixed dynamic-transform offset occurring at large coordinates. ("UUM-20442")
  - UI Toolkit: Fixed elements disappearing when changing both the border radius and padding at the same time. ("UUM-4160")
  - UI Toolkit: Fixed the UI Debugger text highlight when using the search field. ("UUM-1887")
  - Universal RP: Added functionality to stop clearing depth when using Overlay Camera. (UUM-4967)
  - Universal RP: Disabled depth priming on GLES when MSAA is enabled. (UUM-2519)
  - Universal RP: Disabled depth priming when baking reflection probes. ("UUM-12397")
  - Universal RP: Fixed ComplexLit mixed lighting by matching ComplexLit shader keywords with the Lit shader. ("UUM-18553")
  - WebGL: Fixed Unity integration test PowerPreferenceTests.cs failing to build. (UUM-15704)
  - Windows: Fixed building to Windows using IL2CPP scripting backend when running on a Windows ARM64 machine.
