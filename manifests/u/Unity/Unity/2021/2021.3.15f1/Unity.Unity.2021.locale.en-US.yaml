  Fixes

  - 2D: Fixed error when a Tile asset with an instanced GameObject is removed from the Tilemap during a Collider2D.OnCollision***2D event. (UUM-15455)
  - 2D: [com.unity.2d.animation] Fixed a case where new bones are not selected after pasting them in the Skinning Editor and an exception is thrown.
  - 2D: [com.unity.2d.animation] Fixed a case where the auto weight generation would associate incorrect bones to vertices. ("DANB-22")
  - 2D: [com.unity.2d.animation] Fixed an issue where the Sprite Skin editor would throw an exception if Sprite Renderer doesn't have a Sprite assigned to it.
  - 2D: [com.unity.2d.animation] Fixed IK Manager 2D's inspector slow downs.
  - 2D: [com.unity.2d.animation] The visibility tab now scrolls to the selected bone in the Skinning editor.
  - Android: Do not move files in custom asset packs to src/main/assets, preserve the directory structure as it is. (UUM-15109)
  - Asset Bundles: Fixed issue where empty folders remain in the cache. ("UUM-15702")
  - Asset Pipeline: Fixed spritesheet and other previews not being updated in project browser sometimes. (UUM-2811)
  - Editor: Enabling shader keyword pre-filtering so that build process does not have to enumerate through full shader variant space. This fixes the issue of URP builds even with warm shader cache taking really long time. This fix does not reduce the time spent on actually compiling shaders. ("UUM-3711")
  - Editor: Fixed "SerializedProperty m_Enabled has disappeared!" error arpeared in console while undoying switching scripts in debug inspector. ("UUM-4170")

  - Editor: Fixed issue with Selection Wire not rendering. ("UUM-19139")
  - Editor: Fixed material copy/paste so it now copies all properties. ("UUM-6041")
  - Editor: Fixed near planeSize.y in CameraEditorUtils. ("UUM-7797")
  - Editor: Fixed tile palette drop-down flickering (UUM-8307)
  - Editor: Fixed undo bug. Enabled fixed unstable test. Disabled calling dynamic_pptr_cast with pointer to pointer - this caused a hard to find runtime error which could have been caught at compile time. (UUM-19070)
  - Graphics: Bug in mip bias setting on DX11 fixed. ("UUM-879")
  - Graphics: Fixed closesthit, anyhit or intersection shaders in .raytrace files causing a GPU hang. Log an error when these shader types are present in a .raytrace file since they are not currently supported. ("UUM-10113")
  - Graphics: Fixed DrawMeshNow with Metal when changing mesh vertex data. ("UUM-9782")
  - Graphics: Fixed for depth submission crash when no MSAA is enabled (Quest 2). ("UUM-13249")
  - Graphics: Fixed mapped index debug error when rendering null geometry. (UUM-11997)
  - Graphics: Improved use of ClearUnsupportedSettings for the depth texture of a RenderTextureMarkdig.Syntax.Inlines.HtmlInline https://jira.unity3d.com/browse/UUM-16758. ("UUM-16533")
  - Graphics: Prevented a crash on some platforms when the mesh buffers do not exist on a MeshRenderer. ("UUM-4150")
  - HDRP: Re-enabled XR tests for 004-CloudsFlaresDecals and 005-DistortCloudsParallax. ("UUM-1894")
