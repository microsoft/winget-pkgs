  - Editor: Fixed Material Editor large thumbnails not showing up correctly for material texture properties when the texture type is Texture2DArray or Texture3D. (1288995)

  - Graphics: Fixed performance issue when loading textures direct to GPU memory from LZ4 compressed packages. (1307820)

  - Package Manager: Fixed an issue which could sometimes lead to missing files in successfully resolved packages in projects with a large number of packaged assets.
  - Package Manager: Fixed an issue which prevented starting UnityPackageManager.exe on Windows when its path contained non-ANSI Unicode characters. (1317244)
