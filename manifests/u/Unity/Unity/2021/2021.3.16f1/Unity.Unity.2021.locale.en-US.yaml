  Features

  - TextMeshPro: Added support for Color Glyphs and extracting OpenType font features.

  Improvements

  - 2D: Improved performance of TilemapCollider2D. (UUM-6046)
  - Animation: Reduced the time required to load AnimationClip instances.
  - Editor: Improved performance of Handles.DrawAAPolyLine.
  - Editor: Improved performance of rendering the Project Settings. It would previously repeatedly query all objects loaded into the editor, which meant that operations that load assets into memory (entering playmode) would make the Project Settings unusable slow.
  - Graphics: Increased the maximum Async Upload Buffer Size to 2047 MB and updated docs.
  - Profiler: Reduced the performance cost of drawing charts in the profiler.
  - Shaders: Improved performance of ShaderKeywordSet.IsEnabled(LocalKeyword) and ShaderUtil.PassHasKeyword(...).
  - Video: Report error only when the user uses MediaFoundation directly.

  Changes

  - Text: Upgraded freetype to 2.12.1. (UUM-6502)
  - Universal RP: Shader parameters used by additional lights are now removed when additional lights are disabled in URP Assets.

  Fixes

  - 2D: Fixed Stencil so it now works when rendering sprites with GPU instancing on. ("UUM-15295")
  - Android: Fixed issue where "Multithreaded Rendering" is getting disabled after a few Player builds when it should be enabled according to Player Settings. (UUM-18385)
  - Animation: Fixed issue where, for some playable graphs, the animated displacement of the animated game object would keep accumulating when the game object was disabled and enabled. The original behaviour can be restored with the keepAnimatorStateOnDisable variable. ("UUM-3486")
  - Editor: Fix serious Editor performance issue when running on macOS Ventura. (UUM-19011)
  - Editor: Fixed a crash that sometimes occurs when the Windows Editor is closed. ("UUM-19899")
  - Editor: Fixed exception incorrectly reporting object already in pool when equal instances of classes implementing IEquatableMarkdig.Syntax.Inlines.HtmlEntityInlineTMarkdig.Syntax.Inlines.HtmlEntityInline are released to ObjectPool. (UUM-8083)
  - Editor: Fixed for special characters not displaying as expected in built application names on Android. ("UUM-12251")
  - Editor: Fixed SystemInfo.batteryStatus and SystemInfo.batteryLevel does not work on Linux Laptops ("UUM-16083")
  - Editor: Making sure context view context can't be duplicated, copied or cut. ("UUM-2655")
  - Editor: Prevent too many open files error when uploading to Accelerator. ("UUM-19028")
  - Editor: Prevent user errors in when using WorldToLocal after setting Itransform.Scale with a z scale of 0. (UUM-18782)
  - Editor: Removed Exported define from SearchService to avoid domain reload. (UUM-18922)
  - GI: Added the range property to the Light Explorer window.
  - GI: Fixed an issue where Enlighten RTGI schedules material updates indefinitely when animating the emission color of an emissive mesh renderer. ("UUM-10037")
  - GI: Fixed lightprobes getting direct lighting in subtractive mode. ("UUM-1344")
  - Graphics: Added safe-guards to prevent GetPixels / GetPixels32 crashes in cases where C# array creation would fail.
  - Graphics: Ensure LineRenderers and TrailRenderers with only 2 points don't vanish, if the points are close together. ("UUM-887")
  - Graphics: Fixed a bug where ReadPixels would fail for textures larger than 2 GB.
  - Graphics: Fixed Async SSR on D3D12. (UUM-3342)
  - Graphics: Fixed cubemap uploads failing on Vulkan, D3D11 and D3D12 for cubemaps larger than 2 GB.
  - Graphics: Fixed GetPixelData / SetPixelData failing for textures larger than 2 GB. Added safe-guards to prevent NativeArray length overflows for the former API.
  - Graphics: Fixed LoadRawTextureData failing when the input NativeArray contained more than 2 GB of data. Added safe-guards to GetRawTextureData. (prevent NativeArray length overflow and C# array creation failure).
  - Graphics: Fixed RenderTexture assets not accepting texture dimensions greater than 20000 in UI, even though they currently can already go up to 32768 in script if the graphics capabilities allow for it.
  - Graphics: Fixed the Read/Write texture import setting becoming grayed out when "Max Size" was greater than 8192, regardless of actual texture dimensions or size. Replaced with an info box when enabling "Read/Write" that triggers if Unity detects a Markdig.Syntax.Inlines.HtmlEntityInline512MB texture.
  - Graphics: Fixed Unity Graphics Buffer interface for Vulkan for non-compute targets.
  - Graphics: Fixed Vulkan validation error when using DrawProcedural with quad primitives. (UUM-18502)
  - Graphics: Texture 3D Preview (Volume / SDF mode) now becomes disabled if Unity detects a potential driver hang risk. Fixed an assert incorrectly being triggered when inspecting external Texture 3Ds.
  - HDRP: Fixed scalarization issues on Gamecore.
  - IL2CPP: Avoid a possible race condition when the garbage collector is enabled or disabled that could cause it to become permanently disabled. (UUM-16300)
  - IL2CPP: Enabled constrained calls on stackalloc'd buffers. (UUM-14341)
  - IL2CPP: Fixed crash on startup when scripting debugging is enabled. ("UUM-18685")
  - IL2CPP: Fixed handling of numeric conversion IL opcodes in generic code when Faster  is enabled. ("UUM-15402")
  - IL2CPP: Fixed Monitor.Wait with zero timeout so it now returns false. ("UUM-18188")
  - IL2CPP: Fixed occasional missing stack traces in Debug.Log on Windows 10. ("UUM-12672")
  - IL2CPP: Fixed stackalloc to return null for zero length requests. ("UUM-15533")
  - IL2CPP: Removed an uncommon parameter name collision in generated C++ code. ("UUM-14587")
  - IL2CPP: Support casts from arrays to interfaces of their reduced type (e.g. int[] -Markdig.Syntax.Inlines.HtmlEntityInline IEnumerableMarkdig.Syntax.Inlines.HtmlEntityInlineuintMarkdig.Syntax.Inlines.HtmlEntityInline). (UUM-16304)
  - Linux: Fixed Shift+alpha keys so that they are now recognized on certain keyboard layouts. ("UUM-19010")
  - Mono: Fixed JIT assert on arm with large return structs. (UUM-18498)
  - Particles: Fixed errors when baking a particle mesh after calling mesh-Markdig.Syntax.Inlines.HtmlEntityInlineClear(false). ("UUM-8489")
  - Particles: Fixed SetParticles API sometimes failing to emit the correct number of particles. ("UUM-17027")
  - Particles: Orbital velocity curves must all use the same mode. Display an error and don't crash, if this is not the case. ("UUM-8679")
  - Scripting: When switching to UWP it doesn't add NET_STANDARD_2_0 define, it adds NET_4_6 instead. ("UUM-1694")
  - Serialization: When performing an undo on an object that uses SerializeReference reuse existing C# objects, instead of recreating them. ("UUM-651")
  - Services: Marking UserInfo apis as obsolete.
  - SRP Core: Fixed Volume component UI layout issue for TextureParameter. ("UUM-13801")
  - Terrain: Added support for ASTC 4x4 and BC7, and warning to the Terrain inspector when details atlas is uncompressed. (UUM-19973)

  - UI Toolkit: Fixed objects in UI Builder are changing their actual size when zooming in and out. ("UUM-15833")
  - UI Toolkit: Fixed playmode tint not applied to text color. ("UUM-7215")
  - UI Toolkit: Fixed scale 0 to 1 transition bug. ("UUM-4171")
  - UI Toolkit: Fixed TextValueField allocation when setting the same value. ("UUM-8156")
  - UI Toolkit: Fixed the old theme not being removed from the list of documentElement's stylesheet when changing the current theme. ("UUM-11196")
