  Improvements
  - Graphics: Add control to independently clear stencil buffer in CommandBuffer api.
  - Scripting: CompiliationPipeline.GetAssemblies will now correctly include Roslyn analyzers in ScriptCompilerOptions.
  - XR: Removed "Preview" text from UI display element.

  API Changes
  - Graphics: Added: New API functions with no side effects in DynamicResolutionHandler, to retrieve resolved drs scale and to apply DRS on a size.
  - Graphics: Added: New API in DynamicResolutionHandler to handle multicamera rendering for hardware mode. Changing cameras and resetting scaling per camera should be safe.

  Changes
  - HDRP: Updated Wizard to better handle RenderPipelineAsset in Quality Settings
  - Package: Updates com.unity.cinemachine to 2.7.3
  - Shadergraph: Fixed a bug where property deduplication was failing and spamming errors (1317809)
  - Timeline: Updated Timeline package to version 1.5.4.
  - XR: The Oculus XR Plugin package has been updated to 1.9.0.

  Fixes
  - Animation: Fixed issue where Timeline would stay stuck after going to Play Mode. (1315060)
  - Asset Import: Fixed issue where OnAssignedMaterialModel is not called for meshes that get a default material assigned. (1307374)
  - Asset Pipeline: : Fixed asset that could get reported when projectsetting.asset file is modified directly. (1270162)
  - Build Pipeline: Fixed excessive garbage collection occurring during the build process. (1318468)
  - Editor: Fixed "Lightmap Static" being displayed instead of "Contribute GI" in the editor Static flags dropdown. (1298221)
  - Editor: Fixed "TLS Allocator" error when using Asset Store Tools. (1303631)
  - Editor: Fixed for Window with 'hasUnsavedChanges' set to true not being saved when closed with Middle Mouse Button. (1307671)
  - Editor: Fixed IsArrayReorderable method producing errors in Reflect package (1321782)
  - Editor: Fixed multi-target ReorderableLists that have more than the maximum allowed multi-edit number of elements appearing as empty (1317103)
  - Editor: Fixed ReorderableList allocating memory when getting multi-target array size (1297993)
  - Editor: Fixed reordering lists with Gradient elements being visually outdated after reorder (1315679)
  - Editor: On Windows, a maximized instance of Unity on a second, lower resolution display will now remain maximized on that display when the Editor is restarted. (1314966)
  - Editor: Removed EditorGUIUtility.GetSkinnedIcon and EditorGUIUtility.GetSkinnedIconForDpi to fix unloading of unused textures. Moved part of the implementation in C++ while keeping the features provided by the removed functions. (1308097)
  - Editor: Using an unsupported keyCode in a shortcut attribute no longer throws any exceptions. (1303144)
  - GI: Fixed a null pointer bug in graphics bindings. (1310875)
  - GI: Fixed progressive updates not working for the first bake of an editor session. (1300926)
  - Graphics: Calculating correct rtHandleScale by considering the possible pixel rounding when DRS is on
  - Graphics: First Material data is used for Shadowmap rendering when using multiple Materials with the same Shader and different properties (1304644)
  - Graphics: Fix for async texture deletion to make sure graphics commands have completed first. (1280073)
  - Graphics: Scissor test was automatically disabled when changing render-targets. It is not the case anymore and is consistent with other platforms.
  - HDRP: Fixed missing Update in Wizard's DXR Documentation
  - HDRP: Fixed multicamera rendering for Dynamic Resolution Scaling using dx12 hardware mode. Using a planar reflection probe (another render camera) should be safe.
  - HDRP: Fixed pixelated appearance of Contrast Adaptive Sharpen upscaler and several other issues when Hardware DRS is on
  - IMGUI: Fixed an issue where clearing search field using 'x' button does not register changed event. (1306036)
  - iOS: Fixed a UnityWebRequest issue that caused freezing on background/resume when the device is offline. (1315244)
  - iOS: Fixed FixedUpdate being called on startup more times than should be to account for Time.deltaTime on first Update. (1318647)
  - Particles: Fixed incorrect error check in SetParticles that would cause an exception to be thrown when the offset value was equal or greater than the particles array length. (1313413)
  - Physics: Ensure that a Kinematic Rigidbody2D continues to accept MovePosition and/or MoveRotation commands when nested as a child of another Rigidbody2D. (1320783)
  - Physics: Fixed Collision.relativeVelocity being calculated incorrectly when an ArticulationBody was part of the contact pair. (1310485)
  - Scene Manager: This change prevents Unity from crashing when the asset of the current opened scene has been deleted, a new scene asset is imported, with same GUID, and the user chooses "reload". (1309393)
  - Scripting: Fixed Filename/Line extraction in logs not working correctly in some edge cases. (1300479)
  - Scripting: Fixed a problem when adding UI Toolkit pkg to a project where a scripted imported from the pkg would get rejected and exceptions would be reported to the user. (1269167)
  - Scripting: Fixed ScriptUpdater crash when Editor is installed in a folder with spaces in the path. (1309831)
  - Serialization: Fixed regression where Event code could be stripped from build when using il2cpp. (1301147)
  - Services: Fixed a bug where the crash reporting symbol uploader process would crash on Apple M1 hardware.
  - Services: Fixed a bug where the crash reporting symbol uploader process would crash on parsing certain dSYM files.
  - Shaders: Fixed #pragma once directive not working correctly with the caching preprocessor (1322879)
  - Shaders: Fixed a rare crash when upgrading shaders. (1299790)
  - Shaders: Fixed incorrect code generated by HLSLcc for textureQueryLod GLSL function (1314040)
  - Shaders: Fixed incorrect line numbers reported for errors in shader files when using Caching preprocessor (1318689)
  - Shaders: Fixed shader compilation regression on Win 7 (1318359)
  - Shaders: Fixed shader keyword overflow when doing a build (1297800)
  - Shaders: Fixed sprites using default sprite material not rendering in the Editor when build target is set to console (1318066)

  - WebGL: Changed behavior of Application.OpenURL() for the WebGL platform to open an URL in a new browser tab instead of opening the URL in the current browser tab and thus navigating away. (1320393)
  - Windows: Setting a custom cursor now respects Windows DPI and Ease of Access settings related to the cursor size. (1305480)
