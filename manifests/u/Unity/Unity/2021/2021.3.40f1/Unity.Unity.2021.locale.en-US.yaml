  2021.3.40f1 Release Notes
  Improvements
  - DX12: Improved DX12 DRED info logging. (UUM-72380)
  - iOS: Print a warning if there are symlinks in a framework when building on Windows.
  - iOS: Validate that frameworks contain Info.plist file.
  - URP: Update URP documentation to explicitly mention that calling Submit() on a command buffer provided by URP from an user pass is not valid. (UUM-33315)
  API Changes
  - Editor: Added: Exposed constructor of PooledObject. (UUM-64168)
  - Editor: Deprecated: Using XRSettings.enabled to enable/disable XR for an application is now deprecated in favor of calling Start()/Stop() on an XRDisplaySubystem instance.
    Using XRSettings.LoadDeviceByName to load XR devices is now deprecated in favor of querying subsystem descriptors to create and start the subsystems of your choice with the SubystemManager. (UUM-30572)
  Fixes
  - 2D: Fixed an issue where the outline detail is reset to 0 for a Sprite Rect in the Sprite Editor when an outline is pasted onto a Sprite Rect. (UUM-72965)
  - Android: Fixed an In multi-window mode issue, when "Run in background" is true and "Mute Other Audio Sources" is false, Unity will run and sound will always play. When "Run in background" is true and "Mute Other Audio Sources" is true, Unity will always run, but you will only hear the Unity app's sound if its window has focus. Sound will be muted when the Unity window is not in focus. In multi-window mode, if "Run in background" is false, Unity will not run and sound will stop playing. (UUM-56962)
  - Android: Fixed an issue where calling Cursor.visible on Android API 23 would cause a runtime error. Since https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/PointerIcon is only available on API 24 or higher. Cursor.visible won't do anything in API 23. (UUM-72191)
  - Android: Fixed an issue where Input.location would not work correctly even if old input system disabled. (UUM-73469)
  - Android: Fixed IMGUI input even position when screen is scaled to different resolution than the view it's in when input backend was set to New Input. (UUM-68787)
  - Android: SoftInput support improvement on Activity on Quest2/3 when using OpenXR. (UUM-35011)
  - Android: Update AndroidNativePlugin example in docs for all Android architectures. (UUM-72369)

  - Asset Bundles: Improve parallelism of the Main Thread integration and the Preload Manager thread. (UUM-70670)
  - Audio: Fixed an issue that would cause the editor to crash if you delete and then re-add an audio listener component. (UUM-61733)
  - Build Pipeline: Fixed an issue when vswhere.exe failed detecting Visual Studio installations, there was no warning emitted to the editor console. (UUM-71000)
