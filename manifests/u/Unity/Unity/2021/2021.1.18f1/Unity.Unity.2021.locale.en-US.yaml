  Features
  - Android: Adding support for Multi-window environments in Android applications. This include Split Screen, popup windows and freeform windowing.

  Improvements
  - 2D: Improved performance of RuleTile caching
  - Android: Added boot-config/command-line switch "platform-android-cpucapacity-threshold" that can be used to specify which CPU cores are treated as big cores. The cpu capacity is a value in the range between 0 and 1024. A capacity value of 870 yields the same behavior as before the fix for case 1349057.
  - Asset Import: Improved loading performances of import settings for models with a lot of animation clips. (1338096)
  - Editor: UnityEvent callbacks can be reordered

  API Changes
  - Asset Bundles: Added: Added public API to specify the amount of memory reserved for the shared AssetBundle loading cache.
  - Asset Bundles: Added: Adding new API DownloadHandlerAssetBundle.autoLoadAssetBundle for loading AssetBundles asynchronously from DownloadHandlerAssetBundle.
  - XR: Added: Added IUnityGraphicsVulkanV2 plugin interface to add support for chaining vulkan initialization intercepts. (1349908)

  Changes
  - 2D: Allow non-public fields with the SerializeField attribute as custom fields for RuleTile
  - Package: com.unity.purchasing updated to 3.2.3. Please refer to the package changelog online here: https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.purchasing@3.2/changelog/CHANGELOG.html
  - XR: The Oculus XR Plugin package has been updated to 1.10.0.
