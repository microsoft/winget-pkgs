  Improvements
  - Burst: Added support for having [MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.U1)] or [MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.I1)] on a bool external function parameter.
  - Editor: Updated ASTC texture compressor for about 30% compression time speedup.

  - Profiler: Encoded managed heap section type inside the snapshot format, for retrieval via the memory profiler package.
  - Profiler: Reworked native connection reporting for the memory profiler in order to properly report connections between assets.
  - XR: Updated OpenXR Package to 1.2.0.

  API Changes
  - HDRP: Added: Added support for lighting full screen debug mode in automated tests.

  Changes
  - Burst: Fixed enums to match trunk AndroidArchitecture enums.

  - Build Pipeline: Fixed issue where generating a build including script using serializable nested type deriving from type nesting it, could lead to a build at runtime. (1310970)
  - Burst: Crash due to member function debug information on tvOS.
  - Burst: Fixed a NullReferenceException in the Burst compiler when multi-dimensional arrays were used. The compiler now produces a correct error message telling users that multi-dimensional arrays are not supported by Burst.
  - Burst: Fixed DOTS Runtime Job Marshalling behaviour to properly handle marshalling generic Job types when not all closed forms of the generic type require marshalling.
  - Editor: ASTC texture compression should be platform and hardware invariant now (i.e. produce exactly the same results between AMD and Intel CPUs for example, which was not always the case before). (1307140)
  - Editor: Fixed ArgumentOutOfRangeException in TreeView when collapsing rows in quick succession. (1315468)
  - Editor: Fixed items in right click menu doing nothing on non reorderable arrays in scriptable object with custom editors. (1307389)
  - Editor: Resolved an issue where large thumbnail object fields would not scale their texture correctly. (1330963)
  - GI: Fixed performance regression when baking light probes with a light cookie in the scene. (1323393)
  - Graphics: Fixed a situation which could cause the GPU to crash when a Skinned Mesh Renderer is assigned a mesh, which does not match the expected size/stride setup, and that Skinned Mesh Renderer is then used immediately before skinning has had a chance to happen.
  - Graphics: Fixed ACES filter artefact due to half floating point error on some mobile platforms.
  - Graphics: Fixed mip streaming for static batched meshes and use of CombineMesh API. (1329555)
  - HDRP: Fixed an issue where runtime debug window UI would leak game objects.
  - HDRP: Fixed an issue where sometime a docked lookdev could be rendered at zero size and break.
  - HDRP: Fixed artifact appearing when diffuse and specular normal differ too much for eye shader with area lights.
  - HDRP: Fixed blocky looking bloom when dynamic resolution scaling was used.
  - HDRP: Fixed contact shadows tile coordinates calculations.
  - HDRP: Fixed fog precision in some camera positions. (1329603)
  - HDRP: Fixed issue with history buffer allocation for AOVs when the request does not come in first frame.
  - HDRP: Fixed issue with RAS build fail when LOD was missing a renderer.
  - HDRP: Fixed LightCluster debug view for ray tracing.
  - HDRP: Fixed material Emission properties not begin animated when recording an animation. (1328108)
  - HDRP: Fixed NaNs when denoising pixels where the dot product between normal and view direction is near zero. (1329624)
  - HDRP: Fixed null reference exception in Raytracing SSS volume component.
  - HDRP: Fixed pyramid color being incorrect when hardware dynamic resolution is enabled.
  - HDRP: Fixed ray traced reflections that were too dark for unlit materials. Reflections are now more consistent with the material emissiveness.
  - HDRP: Fixed SSR Accumulation with Offset with Viewport Rect Offset on Camera.
  - HDRP: Fixed undo of some properties on light editor.

  - Physics: Fixed an issue where setting an array of null bone transforms to a SkinnedMeshRenderer via the 'bones' property, would cause a crash if a Cloth component was present on the same GameObject. (1328023)

  - Terrain: Fixed crash caused by setting TreeInstances on Terrain in between the time Terrains are culled and the time Trees are rendered. (1317966)
  - UI: To fix clipping with VisualElements that use the GroupTransform hint, the nested masking, which is not supported in this version, forces the leaf GroupTransform element to fallback to rect clipping, but the assert presumed that it could not happen. (1328734)
  - UI Toolkit: Fixed disabled state not showing properly after hierarchical changes were applied. (1321042)
