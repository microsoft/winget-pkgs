  Improvements

  - Animation: Further improvements to animation job performance (esp. some forms of IK).
  - Asset Import: Improved performance of asset imports in large projects.
  - Editor: Reduced the time taken by AssetDatabase.FindAssets when used with a custom filter, speeding up domain reloads and other editor operations that made the poor choice of calling this function in the first place.
  - Multiplayer: Added Netcode for GameObjects 1.1.0.
  - Profiler: Improved performance of rendering the CPU timeline view when viewing large captures.
  - Scripting: Always inline the Mathf Sign() script API function.
  - Scripting: Does not discard AssemblyUpdater output when no updates have been applied.
  - VFX Graph: Reduced the time taken by VFXGraph.CheckCompilationVersion that would previously potentially query all assets on every domain reload.

  API Changes

  - Graphics: Added: Added SystemInfo.computeSubGroupSize API, allows users to query the size of the compute thread group that supports efficient memory sharing on the GPU.
  - Graphics: Added: Added SystemInfo.maxTexture3DSize API, allows users to query the largest 3D Texture size that the graphics hardware supports.
