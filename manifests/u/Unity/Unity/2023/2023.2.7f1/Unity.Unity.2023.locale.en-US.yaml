  2023.2.7f1 Release Notes
  Features
  - iOS: Add Apple Privacy Manifest support.
  Improvements
  - URP: Enable renderViewportScale for XR intermediate textures.
  Changes
  - Burst: Update default LLVM to version 16
  Fixes
  - 2D: Fixed issue where a SpriteShapeRenderer with mask interaction set is unable to be masked by a SpriteMask when using a URP pipeline. (UUM-59737)
  - 2D: Fixed local bounds of 2D Freeform Light from changing when scene is reloaded. (UUM-49000)
  - Android: Updated GetEngineGradleDependencies() API to return asset pack dependencies. (UUM-21692)
  - Animation: Fixed erroneous discrete int and enum default values written back by the Animator. (UUM-58573)
  - Audio: Fixed AudioMixer clicks when abruptly changing volume in Start(). (UUM-368)
  - Burst: Burst recompiles assemblies due to hashes mismatching because of the way assembly defines are combined into the hash.
  - Burst: Fixed an issue where underflows of nint and nuint at compile time would lead to incorrect code.
  - Burst: Fixed an issue where use of certain intrinsics could cause a compile error even if properly guarded by the appropriate IsXXXSupported property.
  - Burst: Fixed android builds throwing a NullReferenceException.
  - Burst: Fixed arithmetic and bitwise negation on native integers.
  - Burst: Fixed burst not differentiating between overloaded generic functions such as T foo(int val) and T foo(T val) when the function calls are foo(1); foo<int>(1). Burst would previously only compile the T foo(T val) function.
  - Burst: Fixed constant SHUFFLE function not seen as a constant when called indirectly through a FunctionPointer.
  - Burst: Fixed the managed fallback for bursts intrinsic functions cvt_ss2si, cvtss_si32, and cvtss_si64 to follow midpoint rounding standard of nearest even.
  - Burst: If an exception is thrown from burst compiled code in the Editor on Windows there was potential for certain callee saved registers to be corrupted. In order to fix this ( editor only - player builds are unaffected), we now save some additional context on each entry point.
  - Editor: Editor crash if a compilation error happened during import from code altering compilation assets during activate. (UUM-58299)
  - Editor: Fixed a bug where the middle mouse button was not centering the SceneView on the selected object. (UUM-58466)
  - Editor: Fixed issue with MaskField using the wrong data to render selected items. (UUM-58570)
  - Editor: Fixed memory corruption when closing aux window when dialog box shows up. (UUM-53154)
  - Editor: Force close an Object Selector window when Render Pipeline Asset selection prompt is closed. (UUM-49311)
  - Editor: Updating fsbtool to match the current FMOD version. (UUM-32863)
  - Graphics: Fixed missed samplerCubeArrayShadow texture binding when processing GLSLang reflection. (UUM-59188)
  - Graphics: Fixed shader stripping when the BatchRendererGroup Variants setting is Keep All. (UUM-59364)
  - IL2CPP: Fixed a crash when calling Type.IsGenericTypeParameter and Type.IsGenericMethodParameter. (UUM-56064)
  - IL2CPP: Fixed C++ compilation error on missing type reference is generic code. (UUM-56231)
  - IL2CPP: Fixed C++ compilation error when Enum.HasFlag was called with a Nullable enum value. (UUM-58451)
  - IL2CPP: Fixed C++ compiler error on UnmanagedCallersOnly with user defined struct types. (UUM-58210)
  - IL2CPP: Fixed conversion errors on constrained calls in shared generic code (UUM-55756)
  - IL2CPP: Fixed null value on P/Invoke method with an [Out] marshalled blittable class parameter. (UUM-57901)
  - Linux: Fixed CursorLockMode.Confined does not confine cursor when using multiple displays. (UUM-57233)
  - Linux: Fixed Multi-touch events not recognizing on Linux Player. (UUM-49191)
  - macOS: Fixed secondary display refresh rate values being invalid. (UUM-37294)
  - Mono: Fixed issue where invoking a virtual method on a delegate would only consider the method's overrides on the first call. (UUM-55774)
  - Scene/Game View: Fixed an issue where continuously panning an orthographic SceneView camera would eventually cause the rendered geometry to be clipped. (UUM-56425)
  - Shaders: Added _KEYWORD_DECLARED define for each shader keyword so that it is possible to select code sections based on the keyword presence. (UUM-59203)
  - Shaders: Fixed an incorrect warning being shown when doing paired calls to SetAsyncCompilation / RestoreAsyncCompilation on RenderingCommandBuffer. (UUM-59508)
  - TextMeshPro: Introduce a shim version of TextMesh Pro for packages that had a hard dependency on it. (UUM-58068)
  - UI Elements: Fixed the UI Builder hierarchy element duplicate command. (UUM-60026)
  - UI Toolkit: Fixed contextual menu resets selection on text elements. (UUM-40160)
  - UI Toolkit: Fixed Timeline and Animation windows cannot record script component changes. (UUM-57154)
  - UI Toolkit: Fixed UIToolkit property field background does not change color when the property is animated. (UUM-26208)
  - UI Toolkit: Fixed unset not working on composite style fields in the UI Builder. (UUM-55325)
  - UI Toolkit: [Properties] Fixed an issue where the source generator would output reflection code when direct access was possible. (UUM-59924)
  - Universal RP: Fixed an "floating point division by zero" warning in Shadows.hlsl.
  - Universal RP: Fixed an "Implicit truncation of vector type" warning in ShaderPassDecal.hlsl.
  - Universal RP: Fixed an "Output value 'fragmentOutput' is not completely initialized" warning in ShaderPassDecal.hlsl.
  - Universal RP: Fixed an error in Bloom.shader for foveated when the debug check is enabled inside FoveatedRendering.hlsl.
  - Universal RP: Fixed an issue where disabling SSAO feature didn't work in built projects when the SSAO disabled keyword had been stripped out. (UUM-56165)
  - Universal RP: Fixed an issue where Evaluate SH and SoftShadow keywords were incorrectly declared in ShaderGraph shaders. (UUM-59974)
  - Universal RP: Fixed an issue where LOD Crossfade was declared twice in Unlit ShaderGraph.
  - VFX Graph: Fixed space conversion error when copy-pasting a system. (UUM-43273)
  - WebGL: Fixed a bug causing audio to skip forward when using AudioClip.Pause() and AudioClip.Resume(). (UUM-54675)
  - WebGL: Improved texture memory usage for Text Mesh Pro font textures on WebGL2 by enabling support for Alpha8 texture format. (UUM-59366)
  - Windows: Removed undesirable HID warning messages. (UUM-56489)
