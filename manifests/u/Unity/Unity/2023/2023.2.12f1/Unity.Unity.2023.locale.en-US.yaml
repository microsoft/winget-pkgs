  2023.2.12f1 Release Notes
  Improvements
  - Audio: Made it possible to create an ARC from a selection of multiple audio clips.

  - Mono: Implement stack probes for Windows Arm64.
  Fixes
  - 2D: Fiedx Invalid SortingGroup index set in Renderer error message appearing when a SortingGroup is created and another is deleted at the same time. (UUM-62716)
  - 2D: Fixed issue where textures set from the ShaderGraph shader are not applied for use in the TilemapRenderer. (UUM-62066)
  - 2D: Fixed missing stencil draw calls when rendering normals with SpriteMask. (UUM-63214)
