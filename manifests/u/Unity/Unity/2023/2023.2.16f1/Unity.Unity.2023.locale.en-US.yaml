  - Burst: Fixed an issue where if two modules were referencing the same external method (dllImport) an internal compiler error could occur - "Burst internal compiler error: Burst.Compiler.IL.CompilerException: Error while verifying module: DISubprogram attached to more than one function".
  - Burst: Fixed information in documentation regarding scheduling generic jobs through generic methods.
  - Burst: Fixed InvalidCompilerException when usage of IsSupportedXXX intrinsic results in no branches being generated.
  - Burst: Fixed that the burst debug information folder would sometimes be saved in project root folder.
  - Burst: Fixed System.ArgumentNullException exception in ILPostProcessing when encountering a library using mscorlib.
  - Documentation: Fixed enum descriptions for FFTWindow to show correct formulas. (UUM-51065)
