  Known Issues in 6000.0.29f1
  - Asset - Database: Crash on GetAssetCachedInfoV2 when opening a project (UUM-14959)
  - Asset - Database: Crash on MonoBehaviour::Transfer when the XR Interaction Toolkit Sample Assets are updated (UUM-76934)
  - DirectX12: Allocated graphics memory does not get released when the Editor is out of focus while using D3D12 graphics API (UUM-86354)
  - DirectX12: The Camera does not render correctly when the Camera.Rect() is changed and HDR is enabled and DX12 graphics API is selected (UUM-86917)
  - Graphics Device Features: [Quest] Editor crashes on toggleFoveation when activating SRP Foveated Rendering in DX12 (UUM-85208)
  - HDRP: Graphics Compositor breaks Unity rendering when the "Output Camera" is changed to a scene Camera and one Camera SubLayer is active.

  - Input: Crash on InputDeviceIOCTL when closing Unity editor (UUM-10774)
  - Mono: [Silicon] Crash on Bytenado.Chatterbox:.ctor when opening a project after creating a partial class of a Dictionary<string, int> containing about 125k entries (UUM-87488)
  - Optimization: Average FPS in Play Mode degradation on a newly created BiRP project when it's upgraded from 2020.3.48f1 to a newer Editor version (UUM-89979)
  - Scene Management: [MacOS] Crash on [NSApplication endModalSession:] when saving while Play Mode is loading (UUM-87930)
  - SpeedTree: This release of SpeedTree includes a change to the interface of the SpeedTree8Wind shadergraph node. If you have an animated SpeedTree in the shadergraph, be sure to connect an ObjectSpacePosition node to the input of the SpeedTree8Wind. If the wind node does not have an input on the ObjectSpacePosition port, the mesh will be shrunk down to a point at origin (making it seem to vanish).

  - Terrain: Trees do not render in 'Unity Terrain - URP Demo Scene' (UUM-84616)

    3. Even after restarting the editor, we didn't update EditorOnlyVirtualTextureState.json that the PlayerSetting methods used as the source of truth for the setting, which resulted in a subsequent restart prompt appearing as the project was opening after the initial restart. (UUM-77905)
