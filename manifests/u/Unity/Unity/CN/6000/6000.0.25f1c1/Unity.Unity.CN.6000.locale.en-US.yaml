  Known Issues in 6000.0.25f1
  - Asset - Database: Crash on MonoBehaviour::Transfer when the XR Interaction Toolkit Sample Assets are updated (UUM-76934)
  - Build Settings Window: The Editor spams the error message "Unexpected transport error from import worker 247. Code=2, error=End of file," causing the Asset Importer to crash (UUM-82880)
  - Graphics Device Features: [Quest] Editor crashes on toggleFoveation when activating SRP Foveated Rendering in DX12 (UUM-85208)
  - HDRP: Graphics Compositor breaks Unity rendering when the "Output Camera" is changed to a scene Camera and one Camera SubLayer is active.

  - Input: Crash on InputDeviceIOCTL when closing Unity editor (UUM-10774)
  - Input: Input is not received after some time when using two controllers simultaneously (UUM-85315)
  - Lighting: Spot light with high Outer Spot Angle produces artefacts/clipping when using the Forward+ Rendering Path (UUM-85566)
  - Shader System: Shaders are always recompiled when the Editor is opened (UUM-75262)
  - SpeedTree: This release of SpeedTree includes a change to the interface of the SpeedTree8Wind shadergraph node. If you have an animated SpeedTree in the shadergraph, be sure to connect an ObjectSpacePosition node to the input of the SpeedTree8Wind. If the wind node does not have an input on the ObjectSpacePosition port, the mesh will be shrunk down to a point at origin (making it seem to vanish).
