  Known Issues in 6000.0.27f1
  - Asset - Database: Crash on GetAssetCachedInfoV2 when opening a project (UUM-14959)
  - Asset - Database: Crash on MonoBehaviour::Transfer when the XR Interaction Toolkit Sample Assets are updated (UUM-76934)
  - DirectX12: Allocated graphics memory does not get released when the Editor is out of focus while using D3D12 graphics API (UUM-86354)
  - DirectX12: The Camera does not render correctly when the Camera.Rect() is changed and HDR is enabled and DX12 graphics API is selected (UUM-86917)
  - Graphics Device Features: [Quest] Editor crashes on toggleFoveation when activating SRP Foveated Rendering in DX12 (UUM-85208)

  - Input: Crash on InputDeviceIOCTL when closing Unity editor (UUM-10774)
  - Scripting Runtime: Crash on tlsf_free when exiting Play Mode in a specific project (UUM-86106)
  - Shader System: Shaders are always recompiled when the Editor is opened (UUM-75262)
  - SpeedTree: This release of SpeedTree includes a change to the interface of the SpeedTree8Wind shadergraph node. If you have an animated SpeedTree in the shadergraph, be sure to connect an ObjectSpacePosition node to the input of the SpeedTree8Wind. If the wind node does not have an input on the ObjectSpacePosition port, the mesh will be shrunk down to a point at origin (making it seem to vanish).

  - Terrain: Trees do not render in 'Unity Terrain - URP Demo Scene' (UUM-84616)
  - Text: Editor hangs when rendering TMP Text Component with Left and Right Margins set in the Extra Settings (UUM-84379)
  - Vulkan: [Android] Particles not rendered in the Player on some Android devices with Android 14 (UUM-68080)
