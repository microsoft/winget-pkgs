  Known Issues in 6000.0.26f1
  - Asset - Database: Crash on MonoBehaviour::Transfer when the XR Interaction Toolkit Sample Assets are updated (UUM-76934)
  - Graphics Device Features: [Quest] Editor crashes on toggleFoveation when activating SRP Foveated Rendering in DX12 (UUM-85208)

  - Input: Crash on InputDeviceIOCTL when closing Unity editor (UUM-10774)
  - Scripting Runtime: Crash on tlsf_free when exiting Play Mode in a specific project (UUM-86106)
  - Shader System: Editor crash when saving Currently Tracked Variants to Asset (UUM-86510)
  - Shader System: Shaders are always recompiled when the Editor is opened (UUM-75262)
  - SpeedTree: This release of SpeedTree includes a change to the interface of the SpeedTree8Wind shadergraph node. If you have an animated SpeedTree in the shadergraph, be sure to connect an ObjectSpacePosition node to the input of the SpeedTree8Wind. If the wind node does not have an input on the ObjectSpacePosition port, the mesh will be shrunk down to a point at origin (making it seem to vanish).

  - Vulkan: [Android] Particles not rendered in the Player on some Android devices with Android 14 (UUM-68080)
