  Known Issues in 6000.0.24f1
  - 3D Physics: Vehicle body is lifted way above wheels containing a WheelCollider Component when entering Play Mode (UUM-84990)
  - Asset - Database: Crash on MonoBehaviour::Transfer when the XR Interaction Toolkit Sample Assets are updated (UUM-76934)
  - Build Settings Window: The Editor spams the error message "Unexpected transport error from import worker 247. Code=2, error=End of file," causing the Asset Importer to crash (UUM-82880)
  - Graphics Device Features: [Quest] Editor crashes on toggleFoveation when activating SRP Foveated Rendering in DX12 (UUM-85208)
  - HDRP: Graphics Compositor breaks Unity rendering when the "Output Camera" is changed to a scene Camera and one Camera SubLayer is active.

  - Input: Crash on InputDeviceIOCTL when closing Unity editor (UUM-10774)
  - Input: Input is not received after some time when using two controllers simultaneously (UUM-85315)
  - Shader System: Shader cache is not used when building the Player repeatedly (UUM-75264)
  - Shader System: Shaders are always recompiled when the Editor is opened (UUM-75262)
  - SpeedTree: This release of SpeedTree includes a change to the interface of the SpeedTree8Wind shadergraph node. If you have an animated SpeedTree in the shadergraph, be sure to connect an ObjectSpacePosition node to the input of the SpeedTree8Wind. If the wind node does not have an input on the ObjectSpacePosition port, the mesh will be shrunk down to a point at origin (making it seem to vanish).

  - Text: Editor hangs when rendering TMP Text Component with Left and Right Margins set in the Extra Settings (UUM-84379)
  - Vulkan: [Android] Particles not rendered in the Player on some Android devices with Android 14 (UUM-68080)
  6000.0.24f1 Release Notes
  Improvements
  - HDRP: Simplified the list of validations for IRenderPipelineGraphicsSettings. (UUM-77499)
  - IL2CPP: RequireDerived and RequireImplementors will now mark all instance constructors of all types.
  Fixes
  - Android: Fixed a crash on GameActivity using Vulkan while rotating the device while playing video launched via Handheld.PlayFullScreenMovie. (UUM-77512)
  - Editor: Adding an 'Include all scripts' checkbox option to the export window allows users to choose whether to include all project scripts in the export list. This serves as the initial step before addressing the script dependency issue. (UUM-46345)
  - Editor: Disabled the SRP batcher on the AssetImportWorker window. (UUM-77344)
  - Editor: Fixed an issue where the Editor would incorrectly mark some objects as dirty. (UUM-83944)
  - Editor: Fixed duplicate separators appearing in the game object hierarchy menu. (UUM-83272)
  - Editor: Fixed issues where the TextureImporterInspector ocassionally failed to retrieve texture platform settings for platforms with more than one valid internal name (example: "iPhone" / "iOS"). (UUM-73858)
  - Editor: Wizard - Some validations were showing the fix button when it was not needed. (UUM-78839)
  - HDRP: Fixed the option to edit advanced upsampling that aren't visible on platforms when they're not supported. (UUM-84078)
  - IL2CPP: Fixed a crash that was caused by creation of too many threads in IL2CPP. (UUM-78115)
  - License: Fixed an issue where the Licensing Client 1.16.0 was not bundled with Unity 6.0.
  - Package Manager: Fix the issue where using the 'Window.Open" API to select a package would silently fails when it is hidden by "Show PreRelease Package Versions" setting. (UUM-82771)
  - Package Manager: Fixed the overflow of tabs drop-down icon. (UUM-79591)
  - Physics: Fixed an issue where Physics Debugger wouldn't take physics shape scale into account when redering. (UUM-83050)
  - Scene/Game View: Fixed an issue where custom tool buttons in the Tools overlay would consume GPU resources in every Editor frame. (UUM-84132)
  - Scene/Game View: Reduced the UpdateState time for custom tool buttons in the Tools overlay. (UUM-84264)
  - Shadergraph: Fixed an issue where a shader graph was reverted to its last saved state when entering Play Mode without saving changes. (UUM-49399)
  - Shaders: Fixed an issue with the Editor rendering objects with cyan replacement shader in game/scene view on each Editor startup. (UUM-75262)
  - Shaders: Fixed the issue with the compute shader logs reporting only a single variant cache even when all the variants were loaded from the cache. (UUM-75264)
  - TextCore: Fixed ATG crash with static FontAsset (UUM-78094)
  - UI Toolkit: Fixed the slider fill element, which is used to enable an element that shows a filled-in area for the value entereind in Inspector. (UUM-83599)
  - UI Toolkit: Fixed the UI Builder Learn More url to include the correct version of the Editor. (UUM-77080)
