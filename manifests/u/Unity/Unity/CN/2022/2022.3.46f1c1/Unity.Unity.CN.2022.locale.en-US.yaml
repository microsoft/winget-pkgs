  2022.3.46f1 Release Notes
  Fixes
  - 2D: Fixed case where SpriteAtlas serialization is indeterministic. (UUM-78559)
  - 2D: Fixed Crash on VertexUtility::CopyChannel when selecting or using a specific Sprite. (UUM-72866)
  - Android: Fixed gradle templates from 2021.3 not being upgraded properly. (UUM-76202)
  - Documentation: Updated "Saving property settings to a Preset" docs. (UUM-15935)
  - Editor: Fixed an issue where closing a Utility window with the Escape key would not prompt the user about saving or discarding unsaved changes. (UUM-71291)
  - Editor: Fixed an issue where custom Editors would lose their unsaved changes upon changing selection while the Inspector is locked. (UUM-59102)
  - Editor: Fixed CursorLock disengaging during PlayMode on Linux when ProgressDialog is displayed. (UUM-76647)
  - Editor: Fixed editor crash when using deferred rendering on cameras with a target render texture that fails to create, such as due to an unsupported texture format without compatible format fallbacks enabled. Now console errors are output instead. (UUM-71811)
  - Editor: Fixed scenarios where the "Auto Refresh" editor preference was not respected. (UUM-40547)
  - Editor: Fixed target framerate capping FPS in the editor game view when Vsync is on to align with the document specification. (UUM-61892)
  - Editor: Graphics: In Frame Debugger, allow "Levels" and "Channels" UI to be used for backbuffer textures. (UUM-78377)
  - Editor: Prevents offscreen camera rendering in the Editor player loop when the game view is not updated. (UUM-77044)
  - Editor: Removed material variant creation when any material selected. (UUM-78852)
  - Graphics: Fixed an issue where the editor crashed when context.DrawShadows(...) with an invalid light index. (UUM-78922)
  - Graphics: In Frame Debugger, fix back buffer texture being shown upside down on y-flip platforms. (UUM-78856)
  - Graphics: LOD Cross-fade was a per-material keyword in BiRP, but a pipeline-wide setting in URP. Therefore, the BiRP to URP upgrader should omit this keyword from the upgraded material. This wasn't the case before, but is now fixed. (UUM-78132)
  - HDRP: Fixed issue with EndCameraRendering being called before renderContext submission. (UUM-60357)
  - HDRP: HDRP: SSGI, Ray traced GI, Path traced GI and No-GI now match when using an IBL. (UUM-37732)
  - Linux: Fixed first touch is ignored when touching on 2D/3D elements in Linux Platform. (UUM-61866)
  - Profiler: Released com.unity.profiling.systemmetrics.mali@1.0.3 with Windows Arm64 Editor support.
  - Text: Fixed kerning issues with certain fonts. (UUM-42148)
  - UI Toolkit: Fixed ListView Element appears out of bounds when multiple Inspectors are used. (UUM-77502)
  - UI Toolkit: Fixed slider dragger being cancelled when used in a ListView. (UUM-74188)
  - UI Toolkit: Fixed unnecessary ListView item refresh when changing a serialized property. (UUM-76654)
  - Universal RP: Fixed shadow-map sampling artifacts present when using the Unlit DrawMode in the SceneView. (UUM-73236)
  - XR: This might have been caused by initial PR of late latching. Reviewing the previous code it seems it should just be setting the local transform. (UUM-46969)
