  2022.3.25f1 Release Notes
  Features
  - Package: Patch Cloud Diagnostics with updated docs links.
  Improvements
  - DX12: Added documentation on how to use the Screen Space Overlay render mode alongside the Graphics Compositor. (UUM-65397)
  - iOS: ProjectCapabilityManager.AddInAppPurchase() now also adds the required StoreKit.framework. (UUM-66002)
  Changes
  - Build System: Avoid empty lines and always use unix newlines in script compilation rsp files to simplify build logs.
  Fixes
  - 2D: Set default projection orthographic for pixel perfect camera. (UUM-31719)
  - Android: Compass timestamp as time elapsed in seconds since the device was last turned on. (UUM-64955)
  - Android: Fixed issue where Unity during application quit would unchain from different signals via sigaction, than the one chained at the application start. (UUM-68176)
  - Apple TV: Fixed Unity editor not finding Xcode application when only tvOS module is installed. (UUM-65168)
  - Asset Pipeline: Fixed crash loading Content Archive from different version. (UUM-64609)
  - Audio: Fixed an issue that would cause building and running the WebGL player to fail. (UUM-68108)
  - Editor: Ensured that strict mode builds do not break when the lightmapper falls back to CPU. (UUM-68496)
  - Editor: Fixed a bug where IMGUI TreeViews that don't allow dragging also did not allow items to be deselected via CTRL + Left click. (UUM-9236)
  - Editor: Fixed an issue where interacting with some Overlays did not stop mouse events from propagating further. (UUM-68629)
  - Editor: Fixed touch state always stay as moved on Linux Runtime. (UUM-61865)
  - Editor: Fixed wireframe-rendering in the Editor when using Vulkan and GraphicJobs. (UUM-45832)
  - Editor: In the initial rendering of the preview in the inspector window, the ambient color of the default sky may not be ready (black ambient color), due to the lag of GPU readback of the SH coefficients. The ambient color is not updated until the preview is updated by some triggers like hovering the cursor over the inspector.
    This PR fixes the issue by using the hard-coded value of the default sky's SH. (UUM-31320)
  - Graphics: Fixed a crash when using legacy image effects with Metal stereo rendering (visionOS). (UUM-58972)
  - Graphics: Fixed a rare crash that can happen when using procedural geometries (intersections shaders) in ray tracing effects. (UUM-68610)
  - HDRP: Added Graphics Compositor Limitation section for VR. (UUM-65373)
  - HDRP: Fixed an assert triggered when the decal count goes over the light count. (UUM-68633)
  - HDRP: Fixed scene modification when exiting play mode with the graphics compositor enabled. (UUM-58350)
  - IL2CPP: Fixed an IL2CPP conversion crash when CreateMarshalInfoWriter encounters a type with a function pointer element type. (UUM-67750)
  - iOS: IOS Player Settings checkbox "Automatically add capabilities" now detects Game Center usage (UnityEngine.Social). (UUM-65304)
  - Package Manager: Fixed a small issue with Window.Open() not selecting a package after creation. (UUM-67571)
  - Prefabs: Removing the root GameObject on a prefab instance, no longer crashes the editor. (UUM-58461)
  - Shaders: Fixed performance slowdown on vfx graph reimports. (UUM-66849)
  - Shaders: Fixed ShaderLab-specific #pragma directives being reported in shader source files when #include is used. (UUM-62756)
  - Shaders: _KEYWORD_DECLARED defines are now guarded for stage specific keywords. (UUM-66001)
  - uGUI: Fixed bug where renderer layer properties reset to default in prefab mode. (UUM-62507)
  - uGUI: Fixed bug with input-field causing performance issues in the editor. (UUM-64746)
  - UI Toolkit: Fixed dimensions of a parent element did not include padding when calculating the top/left/right/bottom values of an absolute element. (UUM-25738)
  - UI Toolkit: Fixed InvalidOperationException sometimes thrown when calling property.NextVisible in a CustomPropertyDrawer's CreatePropertyGUI. (UUM-12851)

  - UI Toolkit: Fixed TreeView with dynamic height clips items erratically when expanding/collapsing items. (UUM-34553)
  - UI Toolkit: Fixed UI Toolkit scaling when opening a second GameView. (UUM-59583)
  - UI Toolkit: [Properties] Fixed an issue where explicit interface properties would have an invalid property name. (UUM-63548)
  - UI Toolkit: [Properties] Fixed an issue where the source generator would generate invalid code for partial generic types. (UUM-62692)
  - Universal RP: Fixed an issue where the built in error shader didn't work correctly with depth priming. (UUM-62825)
  - Universal RP: Fixed an issue where using the "Accurate G-buffer Normals" feature for deferred rendering on mobile platforms would cause a large amount of artifacts. (UUM-62216)
  - Universal RP: Scriptable TAA settings. (UUM-49324)
  - URP: Fixed an issue where screen space decals wouldn't respect light cookies. (UUM-54231)
  - URP: Pass name when the pass is "LightMode" = "Universal2D". (UUM-36358)
  - URP: Runtime intensity of non real-time reflection probes are now immediately reflected in scene view. (UUM-67982)
  - Version Control: Supported Perforce response during the login when it warns of an expiring license. (UUM-64620)
  - VFX Graph: Fixed activation slot was hidden when a block was collapsed. (UUM-59123)
  - VFX Graph: When trying to connect incompatible types, the error popup was left over if the action was canceled with Escape key. (UUM-61583)
  - Video: Fixed VideoPlayerMultipleVideosTest instability. (UUM-67815)
  - Video: Playback becomes erratic in web browsers upon losing and regaining browser focus. (UUM-63591)
  - Video: VideoPlayer support of multiple audio tracks is broken on a few platforms. (UUM-55268)
