  Improvements

  - Core: Added Transform.SetLocalPositionAndRotation(). This allows you to set both the localPosition and localRotation of a transform in a single call, which is more efficient than assigning to localPosition and localRotation separately. (Thank you to @DevDunk on the forum for the request!).
  - Shadergraph: Reduced time taken by code generation when a shader graph asset is imported.
  - VFX Graph: Reduced time taken by code generation when a VFX asset is imported.

  Changes

  - Burst: Entry point functions weren't always included in crash callstacks; now they are.

  Fixes

  - Android: Fixed overflow of MotionEvent global references. ("UUM-8438")
  - Bug Reporter: Fixed the crash reporter text button truncated when screen is scaled. ("UUM-4017")
  - Burst: ;'s in paths would cause burst to fail. Note - Also requires a fix in the Editor, so if your project has ;'s in its path, the workaround is to remove the ; from the folder name for now.
  - Burst: An Internal Compiler Error that could occur if a function that requires a struct ret (due to ABI) has been discarded by other logic.
  - Burst: Corrupted binary could be produced on M1 if there was not enough space for UUID+codesign injection.
  - Burst: Disabling Burst from the command line via --burst-disable-compilation no longer results in Burst errors when building a player for Android.
  - Burst: Fixed a bug in Burst player builds where sufficiently complicated Bursted code could cause a deadlock deep within LLVM.
  - Burst: Fixed a bug where static fields in generic types could in some situations be initialized with the incorrect value.
  - Burst: Fixed a bug with locally declared array variables in functions where storing null into them could cause invalid codegen.
  - Burst: Fixed a safety check bug with Span/ReadOnlySpan and Slice(start, length) where if start + length was equal to the Length of the original span, the safety check would incorrectly report an out-of-bounds access.
  - Burst: Fixed access violation race condition bug.
  - Burst: Fixed error that occurs with a specific formulation of IL, using xx with an early out escape and unbalanced calculation stack. (Object reference not set to an instance of ... in CollectBlock.ToVisitOrder).
  - Burst: Fixed error when compiling assemblies with spaces in their names.
  - Burst: Fixed that UWP builds wouldn't respect the specified "Target SDK Version" and "Visual Studio Version" settings.
  - Burst: Interface methods where not being hashed correctly for constrained types, which would result in burst failing to recompile code that had changed in an implementation class.
  - Burst: Linking issue when exports differ only by module.
  - Editor: Corrected the build of a Mac Standalone player with an exported Xcode project when script debugging is enabled. ("UUM-11352")
  - Editor: Fixed crash in standalone profiler during shutdown. ("UUM-13932")
  - Editor: Fixed the "Auto-hide gizmos" preference in the Scene View page to persist value when reopening the editor. ("UUM-7848")
  - Editor: Fixed the selection when the root game object has a SelectionBase component and the child is a prefab. ("UUM-7831")
  - Editor: Game/Scene view window now no longer flickers on resizing when Graphics API is set to OpenGL. ("UUM-1682")
  - GI: Fixed failing assert by relaxing precision requirement in Ray's IsNormalized check. ("UUM-2787")
  - Graphics: Added error message for indirect compute buffers incorrectly flagged on DX11. ("UUM-899")
  - Graphics: Fixed crash when loading a specific window layout on the Mac editor. ("UUM-11907")
  - HDRP: Clamp negative absorption distance. (UUM-6746)
  - HDRP: Clarify the error message saying the HDRP is not supported on a certain platform. ("UUM-7419")
  - HDRP: Clear custom pass color and depth buffers when the fullscreen debug modes are enabled. (UUM-8397)
  - HDRP: Fixed a null ref exception when destroying a used decal material. ("UUM-4353")
  - HDRP: Fixed bad undo behaviour with light layers and shadows. ("UUM-5701")
  - HDRP: Fixed broken denoiser for ray traced shadows in HDRP. ("UUM-2140")
  - HDRP: Fixed color grading issue when multiple cameras have same volume properties but different frame settings. (UUM-3314)
  - HDRP: Fixed custom pass UI not refreshed when changing the injection point. (UUM-8410)
  - HDRP: Fixed Depth Of Field compute shader warnings on metal. (UUM-7783)
  - HDRP: Fixed discrepency in the fog in RT reflections and RTGI between perf and quality. (UUM-7434)
  - HDRP: Fixed Geometric AA tooltip. ("UUM-2294")
  - HDRP: Fixed HDR Output behaviour when platform doesn't give back properly detected data. (UUM-6400)
  - HDRP: Fixed history transform management not being properly handeled for ray traced area shadows. ("UUM-2150")
  - HDRP: Fixed scalarization not scalarizing properly. (UUM-6360)
  - HDRP: Fixed shadow dimmer not affecting screen space shadows. (UUM-6512)
  - HDRP: Fixed sky rendering in the first frame of path tracing. This also fixes issues with auto-exposure. ("UUM-2427")
  - HDRP: Fixed SpeedTree importer when shader has no diffusion profile. (UUM-1875)
  - HDRP: Fixed tessellation in XR. ("UUM-3338")
  - HDRP: Fixed the material rendering pass not correctly changed with multi-selection. (UUM-2236)
  - HDRP: Fixed the new ray tracing quality nodes not working.
  - HDRP: Fixed the ray traced ambient occlusion not rejecting the history when it should leading to severe ghosting. (UUM-3225)
  - HDRP: Fixed tonemapping not being applied when using the Show Cascades debug view. ("UUM-3942")
  - HDRP: Fixed upperHemisphereLuxValue when changing HDRI Sky. ("UUM-3326")
  - HDRP: Fixed volumetric clouds fog history issue that leads to severe ghosting. (UUM-4801)
  - HDRP: Initialize DLSS at loading of HDRP asset. Previously intialization was too late (ad HDRP pipeline constructor). Moved initialization to OnEnable of SRP asset. ("UUM-5928")
  - HDRP: Removed "Sprite Mask" from scene view draw modes as it is not supported by HDRP. ("UUM-3320")
  - HDRP: RTHandle sampling out of bounds on previous frame pyramid color. This causes sometimes bad pixel values to be reflected. ("UUM-2331")
  - iOS: Stopped Touch.rawPosition changing position when touch is dragged. ("UUM-7581")
  - Linux: Fixed package manager dropdown position and GUIDepth error message on linux. (UUM-11291)
  - Package Manager: Package extensions should now appear directly after package is added. (UUM-2183)
  - Profiler: Fixed issue on Metal where an error message about texture binding may appear in some situations. ("UUM-907")
  - Scripting: When using ObjectFactory.CreateInstance with a custom type deriving directly from UnityEngine.Object, a clearer exception message is thrown. ("UUM-7896")
  - UI Toolkit: Fixed arc glitches at certain angles when using the vector API. ("UUM-7734")
  - UI Toolkit: Fixed background-image-tint not working with sliced VectorImages. (UUM-5076)
  - UI Toolkit: Fixed BezierCurveTo() glitch when the control points are very close together. ("UUM-9846")
  - UI Toolkit: Fixed EventSystem error logged in Editor when entering and leaving Play mode if there's a UIDocument in the scene. (UUM-10360)
  - UI Toolkit: Fixed for 2022.1.X: [UI Builder] @import is stripped from the associated .uss file when saving .uxml. ("UUM-14414")
  - UI Toolkit: Fixed VectorImage glitching when changing the size of the GameView window. ("UUM-4158")

  - URP: Fixed memory leak issue in URP deferred when resizing preview camera window. ("UUM-2385")
  - WebGL: Fixed a bug where losing focus on the player would cause buttons to become stuck. ("UUM-3230")
