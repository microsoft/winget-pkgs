  2022.3.35f1 Release Notes
  Improvements
  - HDRP: Transparent materials now appear opaque when using Mipmap Streaming debug views for increased clarity.
  Fixes
  - 2D: Fixed a Sprite Mask issue with target sorting layers. (UUM-72180)
  - Android: Fixed an issue where setting the graphics jobs mode to Legacy through the API PlayerSettings.graphicsJobMode was broken on Android. It now works as expected on Android devices. (UUM-74079)
  - Burst: Fixed compiler crash caused by faulty alias analysis.
  - Documentation: Added Cloth and Trail Renderer colors to the Preferences page.
  - Documentation: Updated directions to the Project Settings window in our Settings page.
  - Editor: Fixed an issue where Cloud Diagnostics build-time functionality was not disabled if the Cloud Diagnostics package was removed from a project without first disabling it in the package settings. Now the package ensures that Cloud Diagnostics is fully disabled upon removal from a project.
  - Editor: Fixed an issue where polygons are created on the opposite side of the sprite for uGUI images. (UUM-71372)
  - Editor: Fixed an issue where saving a new scene with cloned dependencies overwrote existing folder. (UUM-66799)
  - Editor: Fixed an issue where users could not skip local package scanning during version control initialization by including a new setting. (UUM-70391)
  - Editor: Fixed ordering of CustomEditor so even if removing CustomEditor the order stays deterministic. (UUM-67599)
  - Graphics: Fixed an issue where calling "Texture.SetStreamingTextureMaterialDebugProperties" did not properly set debug properties on materials if Texture Streaming had never been enabled in the current session.
  - Graphics: Fixed dynamic batching not using NEON optimized path when vertex normals or tangents are used. (UUM-72138)
  - HDRP: Fixed a motion blur blending issue. (UUM-54446)
  - HDRP: Fixed a NullReferenceException when exiting Play Mode with HDRP + DLSS + XR. (UUM-48894)
  - HDRP: Fixed an issue where certain Mipmap Streaming debug views (for example: "Mip Count") would not show up correctly on Metal.
  - HDRP: Fixed an issue where the Mipmap Streaming debug views would show up incorrectly when certain features were enabled (SRP Batcher, Volumetric Fog, Volumetric Clouds, and,...). (UUM-70478)
  - HDRP: Fixed an issue where the Rendering Debugger "Terrain Texture" drop-down would appear only when enabling a Fullscreen Debug Mode, instead of appearing when enabling a Mipmap Streaming debug view as intended.
  - iOS: Fixed a small memory leak in UnityWebRequest (custom HTTP headers). (UUM-73104)
  - Kernel: Reduced job system overhead when many jobs finished executing simultaneously. (UUM-73194)
  - Player: Fixed a memory leak when calling GameObject.InstantiateAsync. (UUM-72458)
  - Scene/Game View: Fixed the direction label that was not updating since moving the orientation gizmo to an overlay. (UUM-72103)
  - Scripting: Fixed issue with an InstantiateAsync overload that took a parent as parameter but did not apply it. (UUM-67809)
  - Scripting: Fixed issue with SkinnedMeshRenderer using the original object's bones after being cloned with InstantateAsync. (UUM-67809)
  - Scripting: Fixed issue with values in RectTransform not being copied with InstantiateAsync. (UUM-67809)
  - Scripting: Fixed MonoScript Source Generator missing Additional File warning in Rider. (UUM-49452)
