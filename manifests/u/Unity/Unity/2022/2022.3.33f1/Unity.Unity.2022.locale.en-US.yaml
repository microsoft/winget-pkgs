  2022.3.33f1 Release Notes
  Features
  - Shadergraph: Added a new set of sample content - Production Ready Shaders - to the Shader Graph package.
  API Changes
  - Editor: Added: Added helper functions to PackageInfo, to query the existence of packages, to optimize use cases that previously used GetAllRegisteredPackages.
  - Editor: Deprecated: Using XRSettings.enabled to enable/disable XR for an application is now deprecated in favor of calling Start()/Stop() on an XRDisplaySubystem instance.
    Using XRSettings.LoadDeviceByName to load XR devices is now deprecated in favor of querying subsystem descriptors to create and start the subsystems of your choice with the SubystemManager. (UUM-30572)
  Changes
  - Package: Updated localization package to 1.5.2.
  Fixes
  - Android: Fixed IMGUI input even position when screen is scaled to different resolution than the view it's in when input backend was set to New Input. (UUM-68787)
  - Android: In multi-window mode, when "Run in background" is true and "Mute Other Audio Sources" is false, Unity will run and sound will always play. When "Run in background" is true and "Mute Other Audio Sources" is true, Unity will always run, but you will only hear the Unity app's sound if its window has focus. Sound will be muted when the Unity window is not in focus. In multi-window mode, if "Run in background" is false, Unity will not run and sound will stop playing. (UUM-56962)
  - Android: SoftInput support improvement on Activity on Quest2/3 when using OpenXR. (UUM-35011)
  - Animation: Fixed crash when setting a variable after having destroyed the controller. (UUM-72121)
  - Animation: Reduced memory allocation in Animator and Legacy Playmode performance tests. (UUM-71573)
  - Asset Bundles: Improved parallelism of the Main Thread integration and the Preload Manager thread. (UUM-70670)
  - Build Pipeline: If vswhere.exe fails detecting Visual Studio installations, a warning is now emitted to the editor console. (UUM-71000)
  - Editor: Fixed an issue where the additive reference pose frame would not be evaluated for curves not in the source clip. Shows an error message when selecting additive reference pose outside of the clip range with additional curves. (UUM-66099)
  - Editor: Fixed performance issue when selected objects in the inspector contained cyclic SerializedReferences. (UUM-31375)
  - Editor: Fixed splash screen logo and background sprites being unloaded after preview. This would also unload them if they were being used in the scene. (UUM-72535)
  - Editor: Fixed Windows Editor ContextMenus opening on the wrong monitor when using a 3rd display with different DPI but doesn't address the issue with custom Unity DropDown menus/windows. (UUM-70231)
  - Editor: MacOs framework bundles now preserve their symbolic links when when they are dragged and dropped in the editor Assets. (UUM-70795)
  - Editor: Prefab override popup now supports UIToolkit property drawers and editors in comparison mode. (UUM-3234)
  - GI: Added functionality to set GI Cache Preferences from CLI Args. (UUM-68608)
