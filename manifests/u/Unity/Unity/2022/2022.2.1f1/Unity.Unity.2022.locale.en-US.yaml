  Improvements

  - Documentation: Optimized the example code in HDRP documentation related to Ray Tracing Settings override.
  - Graphics: Increased the maximum Async Upload Buffer Size to 2047 MB and updated docs.

  Fixes

  - 2D: Fixed error when a Tile asset with an instanced GameObject is removed from the Tilemap during a Collider2D.OnCollision***2D event. (UUM-15455)
  - DX12: Fixed for PSO naming in PIX. (UUM-7381)
  - Editor: Composite Extensions for Text/Speedtree files are now correctly selected. ("UUM-9204")
  - Editor: D3D11 BRG visibility cbuffer creation optimization. (UUM-18207)
  - Editor: Fixed "SerializedProperty m_Enabled has disappeared!" error arpeared in console while undoying switching scripts in debug inspector. ("UUM-4170")
  - Editor: Fixed a Crash/Freeze when using Handles.DrawGizmos in OnDrawGizmos. ("UUM-15008")
  - Editor: Fixed an issue where an ArgumentNullException could be logged when viewing Entities in hierarchy.
  - Editor: Fixed an issue where AssetDatabase.FindAssets would return invalid results when specifying multiple search folders. ("UUM-19314")
  - Editor: Fixed BRG Markdig.Syntax.Inlines.HtmlEntityInline entities.graphics crash on some GLES android. (UUM-16708)
  - Editor: Fixed random user input combination would open debug canvas in playmode. ("UUM-17026")
  - Editor: Removed Fullscreen Play Mode experimental feature. Required additional backend work to support input in all scenarios. (UUM-12941)
  - Editor: Under the Enter Playmode Options, the Disable Scene Backup label was inverted compared to its actual behaviour.
  - Editor: Unsaved changes made to assets are now preserved when renaming an asset while using Perforce. ("UUM-17896")
  - GI: Lighting Settings Assets values default to another Assets values when multiple Assets are selected. ("UUM-10419")
  - Graphics: Added safe-guards to prevent GetPixels / GetPixels32 crashes in cases where C# array creation would fail.
  - Graphics: Fixed a bug where ReadPixels would fail for textures larger than 2 GB.
  - Graphics: Fixed crash in depth resolve when using HDR render textures. ("UUM-2316")
  - Graphics: Fixed cubemap uploads failing on Vulkan, D3D11 and D3D12 for cubemaps larger than 2 GB.
  - Graphics: Fixed for incorrect values in ReadPixel for some graphics formats on DirectX. ("UUM-15344")
  - Graphics: Fixed GetPixelData / SetPixelData failing for textures larger than 2 GB. Added safe-guards to prevent NativeArray length overflows for the former API.
  - Graphics: Fixed LoadRawTextureData failing when the input NativeArray contained more than 2 GB of data. Added safe-guards to GetRawTextureData. (prevent NativeArray length overflow and C# array creation failure).
  - Graphics: Fixed mipmap generation for textures larger than 2 GB.
  - Graphics: Fixed RenderTexture assets not accepting texture dimensions greater than 20000 in UI, even though they currently can already go up to 32768 in script if the graphics capabilities allow for it.
  - Graphics: Fixed the Read/Write texture import setting becoming grayed out when "Max Size" was greater than 8192, regardless of actual texture dimensions or size. Replaced with an info box when enabling "Read/Write" that triggers if Unity detects a Markdig.Syntax.Inlines.HtmlEntityInline512MB texture.
  - Graphics: Texture 3D Preview (Volume / SDF mode) now becomes disabled if Unity detects a potential driver hang risk. Fixed an assert incorrectly being triggered when inspecting external Texture 3Ds.
  - Particles: Fixed errors when baking a particle mesh after calling mesh-Markdig.Syntax.Inlines.HtmlEntityInlineClear(false). ("UUM-8489")
  - Particles: Fixed SetParticles API sometimes failing to emit the correct number of particles. ("UUM-17027")
  - Player: Fixed RuntimeInitializeOnLoad not working when used in precompiled assemblies in packages. ("UUM-14487")
  - Scene/Game View: Fixed "Auto-hide Gizmos" preference not remember state on application restart. ("UUM-7848")
  - Scene/Game View: Fixed the Rect Tool center handle not drawing in the correct position during a resize event. ("UUM-17618")
  - Shaders: Fixed asset bundles with shaders not loading correctly on newer versions of Unity. ("UUM-17421")
  - UI Elements: An EnumField no longer requires the associated EnumType to contain a value of 0 in order to be bound. ("UUM-11706")
  - UI Toolkit: Fixed an issue where pressing the arrow keys in the input field of a slider would change its value. ("UUM-12796")
  - UI Toolkit: Fixed an issue where the dragger of a slider would become visually corrupted after toggling the showMixedValue property. ("UUM-13013")
  - UI Toolkit: Fixed an issue where the ListView would generate the wrong hierarchy when the path from the list to the item is also a valid path for the item itself. (UUM-8144)
  - UI Toolkit: Fixed the UI Toolkit property drawer for TextArea so it behaves like the imgui version. (UUM-9969)
  - UI Toolkit: Fixed UI Builder undoing a selection takes two undo's. (UUM-16008)
  - UI Toolkit: Show UI Toolkit warning when the serialize reference are missing (as per IMGUI). (UUM-15589)
  - Windows: Modified full stack traces so that when they are enabled on Windows, Unity will no longer try to resolve symbols from the symbol server. This prevents a potential stall the first time a stack trace is printed. ("UUM-11802")
