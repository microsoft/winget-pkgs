  2022.3.24f1 Release Notes
  Improvements
  - Documentation: Documentation fixes for the Animation and Math API. (UUM-67920)
  - VFX Graph: Improved compilation times with VFX Graph using Subgraphs.
  Fixes
  - 2D: Fixed hint text not showing when trying to slice compress texture in Sprite Editor Window slice menu. (UUM-59303)
  - 2D: Fixed usage of a Tile Palette with the XZ orientation in the Tile Palette window. (UUM-67593)
  - Animation: Fixed crash when deleting states in some state machines. If a state machine contained a state machine transition with a null source state (which should not happen under normal circumstances), unity would crash when deleting any state within the same state machine. It does not crash anymore. (UUM-66549)
  - Editor: Fixed an issue where the TextureImporter didn't correctly apply "Read/Write" for Texture2DArrays and Texture3Ds. To avoid changing behavior, old TextureImporter 2DArray / 3D assets will automatically be treated as "Read/Write" enabled: make sure to change the importer setting if this is undesired. (UUM-61560)
  - Editor: Fixed driver version in documentation of optix. (UUM-66825)
  - Editor: Inspector window controls should no longer become unresponsive after exiting playmode. (UUM-64580)
  - GI: Fixed slowdown in lighting settings UI. (UUM-62034)
  - Graphics: Fixed ReadPixels() using different Y positions. (UUM-58287)
  - HDRP: Fixed screen node not returning correct resolution after post-processing when dynamic resolution is enabled. (UUM-67225)
  - HDRP: Fixed specular blend in premultiplied alpha. (UUM-48661)
  - Scripting: Corrected crashes due to excessive use of thread local data slots. (UUM-58965)
  - Security: Updated MbedTLS to 2.28.7 to address some security vulnerabilities. (UUM-63880)
  - UI Toolkit: Fixed pink text in the Editor on macOS when Intel Iris Plus GPU is used. (UUM-54597)
  - UI Toolkit: Fixed underline shadows. (UUM-54791)
  - UI Toolkit: ManagedReference fields with a custom PropertyDrawer weren't refreshed properly when the type changed. (UUM-66550)
  - UI Toolkit: Nested PropertyDrawer didn't work when there's both an Attribute drawer and a Drawer for the type. (UUM-66687)
  - UI Toolkit: When in Runtime on mobile, a ScrollView will no longer scroll if the touch interaction needs to be treated by a child element first (ex: a menu from a DropdownField). (UUM-39969)
  - Universal RP: Fixed depth buffer disappearing after using SwapColorBuffer. (UUM-44446)
  - Universal RP: Fixed shadow flickering when using Screen Space shadows and have depth priming enabled. (UUM-48838)
  - Universal RP: Fixed the NativeRenderPass camera target MSAA logic to match the non-NRP path. (UUM-56396)
  - VFX Graph: Fixed Construct Matrix operator serialization issue. (UUM-57915)
  - VFX Graph: Fixed some VFX being always considered dirty. (UUM-21302)
  - WebGL: Fixed an issue that prevented multithreaded builds from working if user repeatedly upgraded and then downgraded their project. (UUM-33218)
  - WebGL: Improved IndexedDB filesystem performance by avoiding redundant filesystem persistence operations. (UUM-65276)
