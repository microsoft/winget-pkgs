  Features

  - 2D: [com.unity.2d.pixelperfect] Added URP Pixel Perfect Camera converter.

  Improvements

  - 2D: [com.unity.2d.psdimporter] Improved import speed and memory allocation for psd/psb files by reducing the intermediate texture buffers.
  - Animation: Improved animation performance across the board
  - Undo System: The Undo history now records the name of changed properties ("Modified Intensity") instead of just showing "Modified Property"

  API Changes

  - Shaders: Added: Added an API to control shader memory usage at runtime. ("UUM-5583")

  Changes

  - Universal RP: Messages regarding reducing resolution for additional punctual lights are now only displayed in debug builds. ("UUM-10166")
  - XR: The Oculus XR Plugin package has been updated to 3.2.1 with support for Quest Pro.

  Fixes

  - 2D: Fix memory leak with the TilemapCollider2D when used with a CompositeCollider2D (UUM-15822)
  - 2D: [com.unity.2d.animation] Fixed a case where moving vertices forcefully in the Skinning editor could cause a quad reset of the mesh. (DANB-7)
  - 2D: [com.unity.2d.animation] Fixed a case where multi selecting Sprite Skins would cause a null reference exception to be thrown. (DANB-126)
  - 2D: [com.unity.2d.animation] Fixed a case where pasting bones in the Skinning Editor would move bones rather than copy them.
  - 2D: [com.unity.2d.animation] Fixed a case where setting IKManager2D's or Solver2D's weight to '0' doesn't update solver's effector position.
  - 2D: [com.unity.2d.animation] Fixed an issue where selecting bones in the Skinning Editor after removing any bone in the skeleton will throw an exception.
  - 2D: [com.unity.2d.psdimporter] Fixed an editor freeze caused by over allocating intermediate texture buffers. (DANB-140)
  - 2D: [com.unity.2d.psdimporter] Fixed an issue where some layers would become invisible when merging multiple layers together. ("DANB-131")
  - 2D: [com.unity.2d.psdimporter] Fixed exception when showing PSDImporter inspector. ("DANB-194")
  - AI: Colliders set as trigger are excluded from NavMesh generation ("UUM-10109")
  - Android: New Input System's Keyboard class will treat DPad Center button clicks as Key.Enter. Since that's hold the old input was treating them. ("UUM-882")
  - Android: Use fixed instancing batch size on PowerVR GPUs on Android with OpenGL ES to avoid long compile times in shader warmup ("UUM-739")
  - Audio: Made preLoadAudioData a per platform setting instead of a global default setting. ("UUM-362")
  - Burst: Alongside update burst packages, burst will now correctly handle projects whose paths contain ;'s. (UUM-8322)
  - Editor: Add warning log when the size of a Sprite in a Secondary Texture used in a Sprite Atlas does not match its size in the Main Texture ("UUM-11164")
  - Editor: Fix crash with TilemapCollider2D when used with a CompositeCollider2D and a Tile with no Sprite with Collider Type Sprite is set (UUM-15912)
  - Editor: Fix tile palette dropdown flickering (UUM-8307)
  - Editor: Fixed deadlock scenario in shader compiler. (UUM-14040)
  - Editor: Fixed EditorUtility.DisplayDialog layout after showing dialog with a long text ("UUM-9447")
  - Editor: Fixed issue where Camera and Lights animations are transferred to the wrong animation clip when importing a FBX file with multiple takes. ("UUM-13001")
  - Editor: Fixed lost references to AnimationClips when the ModelImporter clips settings are modified for the first time. ("UUM-2203")
  - Editor: Fixed Verify Saved Assets modal window to accept changed graphics api (UUM-6898)
  - Editor: Frame Debugger: Fixed an issue where the window would constantly refresh when debugging a remote device. ("UUM-4096")
  - Linux: Fixed scrolling with the scroll wheel is slower on builds when using the New Input System package on Linux Standalone. ("UUM-12564")
  - Linux: Fixed Verify Saved Assets modal window to accept user input (UUM-6897)
  - Physics: Fixed ArticulationBody indices not matching when using methods like GetJointPositions and GetDriveTargets ("UUM-1805")
  - Prefabs: Handle ManagedReferences that cannot be applied or reverted. Also make sure the root of the Managed Reference can be applied to apply sub fields that are overriden. ("UUM-5961")
  - Shaders: Exposed Player settings to control shader memory usage at runtime. ("UUM-5583")
  - UI Toolkit: Fix backspace support on linux. ("UUM-3695")
  - UI Toolkit: Fixed an issue where creating a UI Document would re-generate the UXML schema files every time. ("UUM-3985")
  - UI Toolkit: Prevent Tab key propagation when already handled in user scripts. ("UUM-3694")
  - Universal RP: Fixed a resource leak when switching between scenes with different pipeline assets (UUM-14239)
  - Universal RP: Fixed graphics stereo tests
