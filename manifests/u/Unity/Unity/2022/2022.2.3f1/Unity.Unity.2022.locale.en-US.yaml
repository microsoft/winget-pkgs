  Improvements

  - Animation: Improved performance of AnimatorOverrideController.ApplyOverrides(). ("UUM-14753")
  - Asset Import: Reduced the time spent in asset categorization, which happens during asset import and domain reloads.
  - Editor: Clarified that agreeing to update the "Mipmap Limit Group" property on texture importers when deleting/renaming a group cannot be reverted with an undo.
  - Editor: Improved and shortened editor dialog box messages related to mipmap limit groups.
  - Editor: Reduced time to rebuild the CreateAsset(...) menu during a domain reload, it previously was scaling badly for projects with many assemblies.
  - Editor: Texture previews now display additional information concerning mips and mipmap limits. When mipmap limits are in use, the mip slider is now properly clamped as well.
  - Graphics: Improved docs and UI to indicate that VT does not consider mipmap limits. (UUM-12347)
  - Shaders: Improved performance of ShaderKeywordSet.IsEnabled(LocalKeyword) and ShaderUtil.PassHasKeyword(...).
  - VFX Graph: Added a toggle in both VFX preferences in VFX Graph view to allow shader debug symbols with generated shaders. (UUM-19517)
  - Video: Report an error only when the user uses MediaFoundation directly.

  API Changes

  - Core: Added: Gizmos.DrawLineList() API which allow a sequence of disconnected lines to be drawn with a single API call improving performance over repeated calls to Gizmos.DrawLine().
  - Core: Added: Gizmos.DrawLineStrip() API which allow a sequence of connected lines to be drawn with a single API call improving performance over repeated calls to Gizmos.DrawLine().
  - Core: Added: Several new batch Transform APIs that can process multiple points or vectors in a single API call rather than having to make repeated calls on each point in turn which drastically improves performanceMarkdig.Syntax.Inlines.HtmlInline Transform.TransformPoints() - batch version of Transform.TransformPoint()Markdig.Syntax.Inlines.HtmlInline Transform.TransformDirections() - batch version of Transform.TransformDirection()Markdig.Syntax.Inlines.HtmlInline Transform.TransformVectors() - batch version of Transform.TransformVector()Markdig.Syntax.Inlines.HtmlInline Transform.InverseTransformPoints() - batch version of Transform.InverseTransformPoint()Markdig.Syntax.Inlines.HtmlInline Transform.InverseTransformDirections() - batch version of Transform.InverseTransformDirection()Markdig.Syntax.Inlines.HtmlInline Transform.InverseTransformVectors() - batch version of Transform.InverseTransformVector().
  - Core: Added: Use these new methods for improved performance when operating on both positions and rotations at the same time.Markdig.Syntax.Inlines.HtmlInline Transform.GetLocalPositionAndRotation()Markdig.Syntax.Inlines.HtmlInline Transform.GetPositionAndRotation()Markdig.Syntax.Inlines.HtmlInline TransformAccess.GetLocalPositionAndRotation()Markdig.Syntax.Inlines.HtmlInline TransformAccess.GetPositionAndRotation()Markdig.Syntax.Inlines.HtmlInline TransformAccess.SetLocalPositionAndRotation()Markdig.Syntax.Inlines.HtmlInline TransformAccess.SetPositionAndRotation()
