  2022.3.27f1 Release Notes
  Features
  - Editor: Added Apple Privacy Manifests support for macOS.
  Changes
  - Editor: Removed automatic upgrade code for UniversalRendererData from alpha & beta builds of 2021.2 to current as it is no longer required and was incurring a domain reload performance cost.
  Fixes
  - Android: Added android target API level 33 and 34.
  - Audio: Fixed an issue that would cause Unity to crash when you manually destroy a streamed audio clip. (UUM-14330)
  - Editor: Enabling multi-touch by default on Linux Platform. (UUM-61864)
  - Editor: We will remove the intentional crash after the time out of waiting for DX12 fence. The PR also includes the fix for the incorrect error log messages. (UUM-30530)
  - Graphics: Fixed scene getting dirtied when data migration is not required because asset version is above maximal. (UUM-69722)

  - License: Don't exit play-mode when another project is being created (using Unity Hub 3.8.0-beta.1). (UUM-68141)
  - Linux: In our Linux Pulse audio driver, make sure to select the correct default output device. Previously, on some systems and some versions of Linux, we could end up with no audio output or audio output being routed to an unexpected device. (UUM-53143)
  - Scripting: Scripting: Editor crash when trying to determine assembly information for a path that belongs to no assembly. (UUM-64099)
  - Shaders: Regular include directives allow having ShaderLab specific pragma directives. (UUM-70458)
  - UI Elements: Fixed a bug where not having isDelayed set would mean that touchscreen keyboard input would not be captured on Platforms where input is only provided after the keyboard has closed. (UUM-53137)
  - UI Toolkit: Fixed EnumFlagsField menu showing no values when using mixed-value mode.
  - UI Toolkit: Fixed EnumFlagsField resetting value when using mixed-value mode. (UUM-67685)
  - UI Toolkit: Fixed Inspector sometimes becoming black when displaying nested lists. (UUM-69458)
  - UI Toolkit: [UI Builder] Fixed an issue where typing an invalid selector string would sometimes use a banner to display the error and sometimes use the console. The banner will now be used. (UUM-63589)
  - Universal RP: Fixed broken setting shadow rendering layer is not changing shadow when using shadowRenderingLayers in the script. (UUM-28061)
