  2022.3.39f1 Release Notes
  Improvements
  - Editor: Added details to the "incompatible keyword space" error message which is occasionally generated by shaders. (UUM-58563)
  Fixes
  - AI: Fixed an issue where NavMeshData belonging to a scene would remain loaded after the scene had been offloaded. This issue only occurred when the "Do not reload scene"-option has been checked in the editor settings. (UUM-29346)
  - Animation: Fixed additive animations ever increasing non animated values. (UUM-68376)

  - Editor: Fixed wrong unity version in gradle overview documentation. (UUM-75674)
  - Graphics: Fixed crash when using SRP, Handle.DrawOutline() and filtering the hierarchy. (UUM-67677)
