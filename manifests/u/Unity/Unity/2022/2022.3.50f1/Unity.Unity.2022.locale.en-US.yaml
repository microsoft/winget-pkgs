  Improvements
  - Shaders: Improved shader compilation logging in the player. (UUM-79781)
  API Changes
  - iOS: Added: Added iPhone 16 device generation enums and screen cutouts.
  Fixes
  - Asset Bundles: Improved performance of AssetBundle.UnloadAsync. In certain large bundles with many scenes, the async unloading could take an excessively long time.
  - Audio: Fixed a bug that would cause the editor to throw a null reference exception when selecting a clip with auto play turned on. (UUM-71823)
  - Editor: Fixed crash when a Material Variant was missing its grandparent. (UUM-77741)
  - Editor: Fixed the texture's alpha appears as opaque white when the texture format is set to BC7. (UUM-77153)
  - Editor: Linux Editor no longer crashes when attempting to drag from the Project window to the Scene View. (UUM-79812)
  - HDRP: This PR fixes the artifact of non-physical DOF if it's used with TAA and dynamic resolution; The artifacts appear for a frame after the screen resolution changes. (UUM-70751)
  - Linux: Fixed Linux New Input System (Editor and Runtime) not detecting certain keys in Non-US Layouts. (UUM-73613)
  - Physics: Fixed an issue with cloth self collision where setting and clearing self collision indices would cause simulation artifacts unless self collision distance was set to 0.0f prior to clearing. Now when clearing self collision indices distance/stiffness no longer play a role in the simulation of the cloth component. (UUM-78851)
  - Universal RP: Fixed Depth Buffer flickering during screen recording in Android Application. (UUM-77428)
  - Version Control: Fixed token renewal issue: Can't obtain a new token (Message: Invalid Refresh Token., Code: 132.104).
