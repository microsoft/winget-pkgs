  2022.3.60f1 Release Notes
  Improvements
  - 2D: Improved the performance of setting of the SpriteRenderer.sprite property. (UUM-97467)
  - Build System: Added a potential fix and additional logs for the build error message "Read the full binlog without getting a BuildFinishedMessage".
  - TLS: Updated our internal version of MbedTLS to version 3.6. This version brings new and improved security features to network communications in the engine, but also means that unsecure and deprecated protocols are now unsupported. Notably, support for TLS 1.0 and 1.1 was removed.
