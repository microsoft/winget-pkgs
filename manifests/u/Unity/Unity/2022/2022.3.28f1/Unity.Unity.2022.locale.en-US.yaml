  2022.3.28f1 Release Notes
  Improvements
  - Package Manager: Modifying assets located in immutable packages (under a project's Library/PackageCache folder) will no longer immediately re-resolve the project's packages, which can lead to faster iteration and allow temporary modification of those packages (for instance for testing or debugging purposes). Package Manager operations can still revert changes, so the recommended way to make changes permanent is still to embed packages prior to modifying them.
  Changes
  - Android: New Google Play asset packs size and number limits. Unity generated asset packs now are always install-time. (UUM-68512)
  - Android: New Google Play base module size limit (200Mb). (UUM-67708)
  - Android: Updated bundletool up to 1.16.0. (UUM-70552)
  Fixes
  - 2D: Fixed Sprite preview where a small Sprite would have its pixels drawn inaccurately. (UUM-68491)
  - 2D: Fixed undo for GridSelection where undoing/redoing does not restore a GridSelection properly. (UUM-70084)
  - Android: Fixed logic for overriding builtin java file, Unity will also now respect package name inside java file. Previously the logic was driven only by java file name. (UUM-67826)
  - Android: Fixed problem with overflow when validating size of AppBundle containing more than 2GB of install time data. (UUM-71024)
  - Apple TV: Fixed crash in UnityWebRequest when running on tvOS versions lower than 17. (UUM-69946)
  - Asset Import: Fixed issue where older assets referencing URP materials have missing asset preview thumbnails. (UUM-41411)
  - Asset Pipeline: Users are now allowed to save assets in any valid assets folder, which is not read-only. (UUM-65305)
  - Audio: Fixed AudioMixer.SetFloat not working correctly on assets loaded from an asset bundle in play mode in the editor. (UUM-68181)
  - Core: Fixed errors when using baked gi node on builtin. (UUM-70376)
  - Documentation: Updated the PrefabUtility.IsPartOfxxx documentation. (UUM-56678)
  - Editor: Fixed a crash caused by shader variant collection (SVC) shaders with dynamic branching when entering play mode. (UUM-70277)
  - Editor: Fixed focus selected shortcut regression on hierarchy. (UUM-54444)
  - Editor: Fixed issue with word and paragraph selection. (UUM-67715)
  - Editor: Fixed sceneAudioChanged event not triggered when changing audio in multiple sceneviews. (UUM-69574)
  - Editor: When a user removes a TerrainCollider component from a Terrain object, there are no longer MissingComponentExceptions thrown every frame. Instead, it is replaced with a warning in the inspector for every tool that involves painting (Paint Terrain, Paint Trees, Paint Details). The warning message also includes a button that allows the user to easily add/enable the TerrainCollider component. (UUM-67250)
  - Editor: [Android] Fixed float parsing and serializing for maxAspectRatio attribute by using InvariantCulture to avoid build failure on 2022.3 when system language is French and Aspect Ratio Mode is not Native. (UUM-68607)
  - Graphics: Fixed issue when editing a UniversalRenderPipelineAsset that reference same Renderers than the UniversalRenderPipelineAsset in use. (UUM-60618)
  - Graphics: IOS/Metal GPU Timeout crashes no longer look like Out Of Memory crashes. (UUM-55488)
  - Graphics: LineRenderer baking with align mode set to View now matches rendering. (UUM-59746)
  - HDRP: Added framesettings to render volumetric clouds in half res to reduce jittering. (UUM-61438)
  - HDRP: Regenerate the hlsl include that where out of date. (UUM-70083)
  - macOS: Fixed mouse button stuck pressed when focusing window with mouse using Input System. (UUM-69724)
  - Package Manager: Exclude PackageManager folder from ..\ProjectTemplates\libcache\...
  - Package Manager: Fixed an issue where adding packages could fail with the error message "Converting circular structure to JSON". (UUM-63996)
  - Particles: Enforced that a particle system using prewarm does nothing when calling Play from script, if it was already playing, as described by the documentation. (UUM-69074)
  - Prefabs: Ensure AddedGameObjects re-parented correctly in broken scenes where they already have a parent. (UUM-58305)
  - Scene/Game View: Fixed Gizmo disappearing when selecting nested prefabs. (UUM-67501)
  - Scripting: TransformAccess.GetLocalPositionAndRotation() now returns the correct results. (UUM-62533)
  - Serialization: Crash on SerializedProperty:CopyInternalImpl when clicking on a specific Asset. (UUM-68293)
  - uGUI: Fixed the Canvas inspector not allowing all possible choices of the "Additional Shader Channels" property. (UUM-64603)
  - UI Toolkit: Fixed comment parsing in ExCSS library. (UUM-44485)
  - UI Toolkit: Fixed exception thrown when binding a ListView to a field marked as [HideInInspector]. (UUM-69780)
  - UI Toolkit: ListView will be refreshed on Undo/Redo when using custom callbacks on a bound list. (UUM-69779)
  - UI Toolkit: Send selectionChanged when selection is modified through a refresh in a ListView. (UUM-69848)
  - VFX Graph: Fixed missing outputs in Transform operator (and many other nodes with sub-properties). (UUM-70986)
  - WebGL: Refactored code to have a more robust replacement operation when assembling the framework js file. To achieve this the String.Replace operation was set back to a Regex.Replace. To account for special characters and regex that may be present in the user jspre code (see UUM-21896), the final parameter uses a anonymous delegate function to treat the replacement string as a string literal so that it is not processed in any way. (UUM-67705)
