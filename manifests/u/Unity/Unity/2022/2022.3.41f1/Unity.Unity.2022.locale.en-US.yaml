  2022.3.41f1 Release Notes
  Improvements
  - Graphics: Added a IUnityXRTextureManagerInterface and a function pointer in it which is called when VR RenderTexture is destroyed.
    vrDevice->OnTextureDestroyed(ptr);.
  - XR: Updated XR Interaction Toolkit package (com.unity.xr.interaction.toolkit) to v2.6.3.
  Changes
  - Burst: Improved error message for pointer-like types in non-readonly static fields.
  - Burst: Improved performance of Burst-compiled code in the Windows x64 Editor by only emitting context-saving code when the code being compiled contains a throw.
  - HDRP: Create the Global Settings asset in to the current opened folder. (UUM-74284)
  - Package: Updated code coverage package to version 1.2.6.
  - URP: Create the Global Settings asset in to the current opened folder. (UUM-74284)
  Fixes
  - Android: Fixed FrameTime.gpuFrameTime calculation when using Optimized Frame Pacing and GLES. (UUM-64156)
  - Burst: BurstAotSettings files are no longer written to disk unless default settings are changed.
  - Burst: Creating a project with a space in the path would cause burst to fail on windows arm64.
  - Burst: Fixed an issue with default interface methods which would result in compiler errors due to IL corruption.
  - Burst: Fixed another compiler crash caused by faulty alias analysis.
  - Burst: Fixed direct negation of enums was not correctly promoting the underlying type, causing wrong results.
  - Burst: Fixed that Mathf.Approximately would return the wrong result approximately all of the time.
  - Burst: Fixed the BurstDebugInformation_DoNotShip folder not being saved outside the player build folder for Embedded Linux and QNX platforms.
  - Editor: Added bug UUM-61039 where FlushToZero tests where disabled for visionOS. (UUM-61039)
  - Editor: Fixed a bug where Texture2D's weren't able to have changes applied if the Inspector was in Debug mode. (UUM-51993)
  - Editor: Fixed analytics related crash. (UUM-72093)
  - Editor: Fixed Editor.SaveChanges sample code in doc. (UUM-76286)
  - Editor: Fixed Sprite Editor Secondary Dropdown Menu Missing. (UUM-76251)
  - Editor: Fixed the order of some internal menu items being incorrect (e.g GameObject/UI). (UUM-76316)
  - GI: Fixed an issue where Unity would crash when loading scenes with probe data at nearly-overlapping positions. (UUM-76537)
  - Graphics: Fixed crash when a Render Pass is canceled and never continued before making a draw call. (UUM-62109)
  - Graphics: Fixed use frustum culling light setting to work for shadow cascades. (UUM-56026)
  - Shadergraph: Fixed an issue where cross pipeline shader graphs would run into NRE. (UUM-55703)
  - Shaders: Fixed reversebits implementation on metal. (UUM-73255)
  - UI Toolkit: Fixed ListView focus order so it follows: Foldout -> Size Field -> Contents -> Add Button -> Remove Button. (UUM-32041)
  - UI Toolkit: Fixed null reference exception when adding an element to an array. (UUM-54028)
  - UI Toolkit: Fixed reorderable ListView handles with custom display style being overridden by inline styles. (UUM-66690)
  - UI Toolkit: Fixed StackOverflowException in ListView when scrolling to an item. (UUM-69616)
  - UI Toolkit: Foldout can now be bound to a simple boolean. (UUM-72868)
  - UI Toolkit: Significant Improvement to selection performance when dealing with a large number of indices in BaseVerticalCollectionView. This should be noticeable in the ListView, TreeView, MultiColumnTreeVIew and MultiColumnListView. (UUM-74996)
  - Universal RP: Disabled fallback behavior on FSR EASU shader to prevent build errors on machines with old GPUs. (UUM-60575)
  - Version Control: Fixed the Unity Editor stuck on "Creating workspace" when "Use Unity Version Control" was selected from the Hub.
  - VisionOS: Added support for using WebCamTexture to obtain the Persona feed on visionOS.
  - VisionOS: Increased thread priority values for Unity's realtime threads (graphics worker, job workers, etc.) to align with recommended values for realtime applications. This only affects visionOS player builds. This will improve frame pacing on visionOS. (XRVOSB-43)
