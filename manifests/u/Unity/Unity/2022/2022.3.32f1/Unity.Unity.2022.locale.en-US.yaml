  2022.3.32f1 Release Notes
  API Changes
  - Editor: Added: Exposed constructor of PooledObject. (UUM-64168)
  - URP: Added: RenderPipelineManager callbacks are raised from UniversalRenderPipeline.SingleCameraRequest. (UUM-69268)
  Fixes
  - 2D: Fixed Case where there is high memory usage and crash on DynamicHeapAllocator::CreateTLSFBlock when opening project with Sprite Atlas V2 enabled. (UUM-43709)
  - Android: Fixed issues where calling Cursor.visible on Android API 23 would cause a runtime error. Since https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/PointerIcon is only available on API 24 or higher. Cursor.visible won't do anything in API 23. (UUM-72191)
  - Android: Updated AndroidNativePlugin example in docs for all Android architectures. (UUM-72369)
  - Android: WebcamTexture on android requires camera permission granted. (UUM-45900)
  - Animation: Fixed PlayableDirector fields that were not being updated when the Bindings section was expanded. (UUM-71674)
  - Audio: Fixed a bug that would cause the editor to crash if you delete and then re-add an audio listener component. (UUM-61733)
  - DX12: ComputeBuffer CopyCount returns correct value following multiple compute dispatches. (UUM-66900)
  - Editor: 2D: Updated 2D Feature documentation link. (UUM-70575)
  - Editor: Added rosbutness to splitter ControlId so it works with DataMode ui (used in entity). (UUM-67862)
  - Editor: All indexes are created with Temp and External as exclude. (UUM-70905)
  - Editor: Fixed both bugs related to PropertyEditor and Debug mode. (UUM-64257)
  - Editor: Fixed issue where building in batch mode can open file explorer unexpectedly and cause a hang when running on headless windows servers. (UUM-68288)

  - Editor: IME input does not work with Input System when using Chinese (Simplified) input bug resolution. (UUM-61922)
  - Editor: UnityEditor.Build.Content.ObjectIdentifier comparison operators have been changed to be more consistent and use all of the fields. This improves determinism for asset bundle builds. (UUM-71772)
