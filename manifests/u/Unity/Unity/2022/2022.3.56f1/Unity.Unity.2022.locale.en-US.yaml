  - Graphics: Fixed an issue on Android platforms with Vulkan where swapchain recreation synchronization could cause a degenerate case where pausing the application during a scene load would result in a crash due to an invalid vkCmdEndRenderPass command being added to command buffers that have not begun a render pass. (UUM-90287)
