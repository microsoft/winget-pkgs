  2022.3.37f1 Release Notes
  Improvements
  - Mono: Added Unity Embedding API to load assembly refs with error checking.
  - VisionOS: Plugin path "Assets/Plugins/VisionOS/" is now recognized and auto-selects VisionOS as compatible platform.
  Fixes
  - Android: Fixed detection of Play Asset Delivery support to avoid problems if there is play.core dependency in the project. (UUM-74252)
  - Asset Bundles: Only call CollectAllSpriteAtlasesAndPack once when building AssetBundles. (UUM-73147)
  - Editor: Hide a RenderMode field from Light Component in URP and removed related documentation. (UUM-70283)
  - Editor: Motion Vector pass also filter objects by Opaque Mask. (UUM-72748)
  - Graphics: Added validation that SetVertexAttribute() streams doesnt create gaps. (UUM-72229)
  - Graphics: Fixed broken URL for documentation on Texture2D. (UUM-74607)
  - GraphView: Some Mac keyboard events not having mousePosition in the editor. (UUM-62291)
  - IL2CPP: Fixed possible crash in fully shared generic code at calls at the generic code generation limit. (UUM-73629)
  - iOS: Don't symlink .xcprivacy files when "Symlink Sources" build option is selected. (UUM-72375)
  - iOS: Fixed touches getting stuck when orientation is forced from code while touching the screen. (UUM-53903)
  - License: Fixed a bug where normal floating communication regarding feature status would generate too many log messages.
  - License: Fixed a bug where web proxy credentials would not be found when added through a dialog triggered by macOS/Safari after web proxy auto-discovery was enabled.
  - macOS: Fixed forward and back buttons being recognized as middle button. (UUM-70259)
  - Mono: Fixed memory leak when validating a SSL certificate. (UUM-72433)
  - Physics: Fixed a memory corruption for OverlapXCommand APIs where we would end up writing out of bounds into the results array. Effectively corrupting the adjacent memory block, this would eventually lead to a crash, either immediately or shortly after the operation concluded. (UUM-71476)
  - Player: Fixed possible crash on shut down when custom player loop is set. (UUM-72551)
  - Prefabs: Ensure Awake is called after SetParent and MergePrefabInstances for all objects on duplicate. (UUM-56488)
  - UI Toolkit: UI Toolkit foldout interaction enabled on controllers. (UUM-73752)
  - Universal RP: Fixed an issue with enabling instancing at runtime for a Decal material. (UUM-72363)
  - VFX Graph: Fixed VFX graph renders the wrong mesh when using different exposed meshes with instancing enabled. (UUM-59091)
  - VFX Graph: Flickering with VFX using instancing and overriding an exposed texture with an empty texture. (UUM-74322)
  - VFX Graph: Force culling when VFX rendering is disabled. (UUM-71482)
  - VFX Graph: Improved how the sleep state is updated for particle systems receiving GPU events. (UUM-73758)
  - VFX Graph: Wrong mesh rendered with instancing, when using multi mesh output and exposed submesh mask. (UUM-74240)
  - VisionOS: Consider plugins compatibility even if their .meta files are empty (default import settings). (UUM-72377)
