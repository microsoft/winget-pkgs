ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Improved lock feature so that it works properly in both the main window and note windows. When you lock the main window, note windows will also show the lock screen instead of closing.
  - When moving a list item up or down, its nested items will now move together as a group.
  - Improved exporting notes with links to elements in HTML format, so clicking a link will scroll directly to the linked element in the browser.
  - Improved exporting notes from a notebook – when merging into a single note, the content will now follow the order of notes in the notebook.
  - The note info panel can now be resized.
  - Fixed an issue with the Reset Zoom shortcut on Mac.
  - Fixed a bug where toggling bold, italic, or underline formatting did not always work reliably.
  - Fixed an issue where deleting an empty collapsible section or blockquote sometimes didn’t work.
  - Fixed an issue where pasting text from Perplexity.ai did not preserve code blocks.
