  What to download
  - For Windows (two options, functionally the same)
  - QuPath-0.4.4-Windows.msi - if you want a standard Windows (local) installer
  - QuPath-0.4.4-Windows.zip - unzip it and double-click QuPath-0.4.4.exe (no further installation needed)
  - For Mac (two options, depending upon processor)
  - QuPath-0.4.4-Mac.pkg - for Macs with Intel Processors or Apple Silicon (M1/M2)
  - QuPath-0.4.4-Mac-arm64.pkg - for Macs using Apple Silicon only (experimental).
    This runs much faster, but you'll need to install OpenSlide separately.
  - To install: right-click and choose Open to install.
    Note that this will try to install to /Applications/QuPath.app - if you have an older version at that location that you want to keep, you should rename it before installation.
  - For Linux
  - QuPath-0.4.4-Linux.tar.xz - use chmod u+x /path/to/QuPath/bin/QuPath to make the launcher executable.
    If you suffer pixman problems, you might find the alternative bash script /path/to/QuPath/bin/QuPath.sh better for launching the software.
