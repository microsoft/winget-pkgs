Description: |-
  USBDLM is a Windows service that gives control over Windows' drive letter
  assignment for USB drives.

  Running as service makes it independent of the logged on user's privileges, so
  there is no need to give the users the privilege to change drive letters. It
  automatically solves conflicts between USB drives and network or subst drives of
  the currently logged on user.

  Furthermore you can define new default letters for USB drives and much more.

  It works on Windows XP to Windows 11 and Server 2003 to 2025.
ReleaseNotes: |
  - Bugfix: Size of network and subst drives not determined
  - Bugfix: On high DPI sometimes too small icons in the balloontip
