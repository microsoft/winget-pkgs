Description: |-
  USBDLM is a Windows service that gives control over Windows' drive letter assignment for USB drives.
  Running as service makes it independent of the logged on user's privileges, so there is no need to give the users the
  privilege to change drive letters. It automatically solves conflicts between USB drives and network or subst drives of the currently logged on user.
  Furthermore you can define new default letters for USB drives and much more.
  It works on Windows XP to Windows 11 and Server 2003 to 2022.
