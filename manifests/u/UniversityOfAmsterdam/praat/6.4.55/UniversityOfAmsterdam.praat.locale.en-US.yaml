  - Opening TIFF files with Read from file..., as well as Insert picture from file...: rid a bug that would show monochrome TIFF files in four vertical stripes.
  - Scripting: in pause forms, allow vector expressions as defaults in vector fields.
  - Backslash trigraph for apico-postalveolars: ṣ (s\.v), following Ladefoged & Maddieson (1996), who wanted to distinguish them from the more extreme retroflexes, i.e. apico-palatals such as ʂ (\s.).
