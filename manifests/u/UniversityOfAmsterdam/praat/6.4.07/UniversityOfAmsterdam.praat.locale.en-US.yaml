ReleaseNotes: |-
  - The command Sound & Pitch: To PointProcess (cc), which is also used when computing the times of pulses in the Sound window, could cause Praat to freeze when the pitch ceiling (and the measured pitch) were very high; this problem existed since at least 2001.
  - eSpeak: new version, with e.g. Tigrinya.
  - Support for 119-dpi graphics on Windows.
  - Repaired a bug that could cause the Artword windows to crash if the Time field was left empty.
