ReleaseNotes: |-
  • TextGrid window: removed a bug that caused slow scrolling (i.e. computation of whole-sound Pitch and Formant objects) if the TextGrid was much longer than the Sound and the Sound was scrolled out of sight.
  • EEG window: repaired a bug that caused Praat to crash when clicking View & Edit.
  • Windows Demo window: made Escape key available to demoKey$() (this had been a bug since the beginning of the Demo window, i.e. since May 2009).
  • Read TextGrid from ESPS label file...
  • Repaired a bug that could cause Praat to crash on pitch analysis when a part of the sound was constant.
  • Insert picture from file...: the picture is now embedded into Praat picture files; this also solves a problem with file paths that surfaced when a script called another script that inserted a picture.
  • Photo: Save as PNG file...: repaired a bug that caused a crash on the Mac.
