ReleaseNotes: |-
  - MacOS Tahoe: support making menu choices or turning windows to full screen if a script is paused (by the Demo window or the Pause window), as on earlier MacOS versions and on Windows and Linux.
  - Windows: support horizontal scrolling in three ways (two-finger swiping on the touchpad; left and right tilting of the mouse’s scroll wheel; turning the mouse’s scroll wheel while keeping the Shift key pressed).
  - Windows: better dotted or dashed thick lines.
  - Sound: To PowerCepstrogram... now averages the power over channels instead of taking only channel 1.
  - Opening TIFF files with Read from file..., as well as Insert picture from file...: rid a bug that would show monochrome TIFF files in four vertical stripes.
  - Mac and Linux: made Insert picture from file... work for PDF files again (bug since 6.4.28).
  - Backslash trigraph for apico-postalveolars: ṣ (s.v), following Ladefoged & Maddieson (1996), who wanted to distinguish them from the more extreme retroflexes, i.e. apico-palatals such as ʂ (\s.).
  - Linux: prevented a crash when a “barren” edition tried to run runAllTests_batch.praat.
  - Scripting: runSubprocess and runSystem now support asynchronous, with which you can spawn a subprocess without waiting for it to finish.
  - Scripting: randomImax.
  - Scripting: in pause forms, allow vector expressions as defaults in vector fields.
  - Scripting: syntax check against duplicate procedure names.
  - Scripting: no longer any limits on the number of labels and procedures.
