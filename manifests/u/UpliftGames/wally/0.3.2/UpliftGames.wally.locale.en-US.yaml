ReleaseNotes: |-
  It's finally time... 0.3.2 IS HERE!
  ðŸ’ª Link generation and dev dependencies are fully stable!
  That's right! Use dev dependencies however you want and it should just work! No matter how many packages you use and how complex the resolution is, wally should correctly deduplicate and link them in the most efficient way possible.
  âš¡ Packages now download fast
  How fast? We benchmarked installing over 1200 packages and on average internet it took just under 10 seconds! Before it would take almost 5 minutes! It is time to use all the packages. There is even a pretty output to make it feel extra smooth.
  ðŸ”’ Lockfiles are improved
  Lockfiles only stored shared dependencies! They will now store all dependencies. This is notable because it means when you next wally install your lockfiles will change. Don't fear, they will now be correct!
  ðŸ’ž And finally
  A big thanks to everyone who contributed to this release! It's great to see people getting involved even if it does take some time to get those changes merged. I hope to increase our merge speed and release cadence moving forward.
