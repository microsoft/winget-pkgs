ShortDescription: VNC client and server graphical desktop sharing via RFB protocol
Description: |-
  UltraVNC is an open source application that uses the VNC protocol to control another computer remotely over a network connection.
  UltraVNC allows the use of a remote computer as if the user were in front of it.
  This is achieved by sending mouse movements and key-presses to the remote computer, and replicating the remote computer's display (subject to differences in resolution) locally in real time.
  UltraVNC bears a strong resemblance to RealVNC Free Edition.
  However, in addition to remote control it adds various features, such as an encryption plugin to secure the client/server connection.
  It also supports file transfers, chat functionality and various authentication methods.
  The two computers must be able to communicate across a network, such as a local subnet, internal network, or the Internet.
