ShortDescription: A free, secure, portable, extendable, high-performance executable packer for several executable formats.
Description: |-
  UPX is an advanced executable file compressor. UPX will typically reduce the file size of programs and DLLs by around 50%-70%, thus reducing disk space, network load times, download times and other distribution and storage costs.
  Programs and libraries compressed by UPX are completely self-contained and run exactly as before, with no runtime or memory penalty for most of the supported formats.
  UPX supports a number of different executable formats, including Windows programs and DLLs, macOS apps and Linux executables.
