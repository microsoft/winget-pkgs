ReleaseNotes: |-
  ðŸ“¦ Rust Coreutils 0.0.30 Release:
  We are excited to announce the release of Rust Coreutils 0.0.30!
  Highlights:
  - Improved Compatibility:
    - This release focused on compatibility with the upstream GNU Coreutils 9.6 release. This is why the number of passing tests didn't change much - our effort was directed at adapting to the new upstream version rather than fixing existing test failures.
    - Passing GNU tests increased to 507 (+1 compared to 0.0.29).
  - Contributions: This release was made possible by the dedication of 22 contributors, including 8 newcomers.
  - We also announced at FOSDEM the extension of this project to cover other key Linux tools through our uutils initiative. This will extend the Rust rewrite effort to additional common Unix tools. See the presentation on YouTube (slides) or read the LWN article for more details about our vision.
  GNU Test Suite Compatibility:
  Here's how version 0.0.30 compares to the previous release:
