  Rust Coreutils 0.6.0 Release:
  We are happy to announce the release of Rust Coreutils 0.6.0 — a major milestone achieving 96% GNU compatibility with significant safety improvements, enhanced locale support, and extensive bug fixes!
  Highlights:
  - Major GNU Compatibility Leap
    - 622 passing tests (+56 from 0.5.0), achieving 96.28% compatibility
    - Reduced failures from 55 to just 16 (-39) and skipped tests from 23 to 7 (-16)
    - Extensive test suite improvements across sort, ls, date, cksum, tail, and many more
  - Safety & Code Quality
    - Removed unsafe code from date, sort, locale.rs, and other utilities
    - Replaced raw libc calls with safe nix crate equivalents throughout
    - Enhanced error handling to avoid panics on /dev/full writes across many utilities
  - Locale & Internationalization
    - Added ICU support for locale-aware day/month names in date
    - Implemented locale-aware hour formatting and calendar support
    - Added locale-aware numeric sorting with thousand separator support in sort
    - Locale-aware collation support in join
  - Performance Improvements
    - base32/base64/basenc: Optimized with reduced memset operations
    - shuf: Optimized numeric output and added --random-seed option
    - date: Wrapped stdout in BufWriter for batch processing
    - uniq: Optimized memory usage for ignore-case comparison
    - tsort: Avoid reading entire input into memory, intern strings
