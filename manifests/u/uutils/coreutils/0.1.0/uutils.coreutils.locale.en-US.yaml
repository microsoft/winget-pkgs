    New SELinux integration in cp, ls, mkdir, mknod, mkfifo, install, and stat.
    Plus, SELinux-aware CI testing is now live!
  - Performance Improvements
    Notable speedups in cat, ls, wc, tail, seq, and more â€” many now match or exceed GNU performance.
  - Ubuntu Plans to Ship uutils
    Ubuntu is beginning to integrate Rust Coreutils into its base system!
    âž¤ Oxidizing Ubuntu
  - Huge Contribution Wave
