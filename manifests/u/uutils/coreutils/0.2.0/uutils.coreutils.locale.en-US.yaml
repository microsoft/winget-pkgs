ReleaseNotes: |-
  📦 Rust Coreutils 0.2.0 Release:
  We are excited to announce the release of Rust Coreutils 0.2.0 — our first fully internationalized release!
  This milestone brings comprehensive localization support, major performance improvements, and enhanced Unicode handling.
  Highlights:
  - Full Internationalization & Localization
    Complete translation infrastructure using Mozilla's Fluent framework with French translations included.
    Support for complex plural forms (Arabic, Hebrew, etc.) and locale-aware formatting.
    Even error messages from clap are fully localizable!
  - Community Translation Platform
    Join our translation efforts at Weblate
    or contribute directly via our l10n repository
  - Unicode & Non-UTF8 Path Support
    All programs now handle non-UTF8 paths seamlessly while supporting full Unicode features.
    Example: echo "🍔🍟🥤" | cut -d"🍟" -f1 works perfectly with emoji delimiters!
  - Massive Performance Gains
    Notable example: tr went from 9.81x slower than GNU to 1.58x faster — a 15x improvement!
    Additional optimizations in sort, cat, and other utilities.
  - Enhanced GNU Compatibility
    538 passing tests (+16 from 0.1.0), with reduced failures from 65 to 52.
    Continued improvements in edge case handling and behavior matching.
  - Production Ready for Ubuntu
    As part of Ubuntu's announcement of plans to integrate Rust Coreutils, this release focuses on stability and compatibility improvements to ensure Ubuntu users have the best possible experience.
