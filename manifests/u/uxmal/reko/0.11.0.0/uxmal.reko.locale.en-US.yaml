# Agreements: 
ReleaseNotes: |-
  This release of Reko has breaking changes in interfaces and classes, and completes the move to .NET 5.0.
  
  Many classes were also moved to different namespaces:
  • you'll need to recompile your project.
  • The file loading code was refactored heavily to be easier to use and to support the reading of files stored in (potentially deeply nested) archives.
  • Many fixes were made in the AArch64 rewriter (with gentle prodding from @rfalke).

  Some other new features are:
  • Wasm files can be loaded and disassembled. A rewriter will materialize in a later release.
  • Reko Gui is asynchronous. This will help the ongoing port to Avalonia.
  • Stack variable references that escape to other procedures are now tracked (courtesy of @ptomin).
  • The new ByteTrie class can be used for pattern matching.
  • Added support for PDP-10 architecture. The PDP-10 is word-addressable, has 36-bit words, 18-bit addresses, and variable sized bytes, all of which contrast vividly with present day 8-bit-based architectures.
  • The MemoryControl displays sizes other than bytes. This accommodates PDP-10, Microchip PIC, and Mil-Std-1750A.
  • Intrinsic procedures can now have generic parameter and return types.
  • Added initial support for COFF files.
  • Adapted OllyLangInterpreter to other architectures than X86.
  • Added m6502 emulator, c64 emulator.
  • Various CI improvements and fixes. Also, Reko now builds on ARM64! (courtesy of @smx-smx)
  • Added support for constants larger than 64 bits.
  • Support for reading TAR and AR archives.
  • Support loading files from arbitrarily nested archives.
  • Rewrote the loader so it is much easier to use (and understand).
  • Extended C parser to handle more GCC attributes.
  • Support for Sanyo LC8670.
