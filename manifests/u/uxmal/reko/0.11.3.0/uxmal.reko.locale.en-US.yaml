ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Introduced the notion of Unlikely instructions: instructions that while well-formed are unlikely to be present in a "normal" program.
    Reko can optionally be instructed to treat such unlikely instructions as invalid
  - The user may also optionally instruct the Reko to treat protected/system instructions as invalid.
  - Since the move to .
    NET 6, Reko's custom 16-bit IEEE float implementation became redundant and was removed.
  - The GUI client now supports multiple scanning heuristics.
  - Support for user-defined segments was added.
  - Improvements in handling of varargs procedures.
  - Switch statements for MIPS, MIL-STD-1750A and Intel 8051 improved.
