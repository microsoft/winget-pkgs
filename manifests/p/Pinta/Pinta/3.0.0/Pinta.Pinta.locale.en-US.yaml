ReleaseNotes: |-
  ### Credits

  This is a major new release of Pinta, with large changes to its architecture
  including porting to GTK4 and libadwaita. Using GTK4 also required porting Pinta
  to use a new library (Gir.Core) for C# bindings to GTK and other GObject
  libraries, so special thanks goes to @badcel and the @gircore contributors for
  their excellent work on that project!

  This release also coincides with a new and improved project website, contributed
  by @rolandixor !

  Also, thanks to everyone who contributed translations, filed bugs, made
  packages, and everything else!

  ### Added

  - Ported to GTK4 and libadwaita
  - Upgraded the minimum required .NET version to 8.0
  - Added an arm64 installer for macOS (Apple silicon)
  - Restored support for add-ins, which had been disabled in Pinta 2.0 due to technical limitations
  - Added a preference (in the View menu) for switching between a dark or light color scheme
  - Added an improved color picker dialog (#570, #761, #1025)
  - Added a canvas grid with customizable size, replacing the previous pixel grid (#1028, #1105)
  - Added ability to choose tile type (#1051) and edge behavior (#1141) in tile reflection effect
  - Added a new "Dithering" effect (#457)
  - Added "Voronoi Diagram" effect (#692)
  - Ported "Vignette" and "Dents" effects from Paint.NET 3.36 (#881, #885)
  - Added "Feather Object" effect (#886, #953)
  - Added "Align Object" effect (#936, #961)
  - Added "Outline Object" effect (#971)
  - Added support for exporting to portable pixmap (.ppm) files (#549)
  - Added a nearest-neighbor resampling mode when resizing images (#596)
  - Added support for customizable gradients in the fractal and clouds effects (#578, #678, #683)
  - Added a new Offset Selection option to the Edit menu to expand or contract the current selection (#661, #740, #746)
  - The Windows build of Pinta now supports loading .webp images (#770)
  - Improved zooming behavior with trackpads, including support for the pinch to zoom gesture (#634, #715)
  - The Windows installer is now signed, thanks to the support of SignPath (#1054)
  - The brush size and line width settings for many tools can now be adjusted with the [ and ] keyboard shortcuts (#796, #1155)

  ### Changed

  - Due to API changes in GTK4, the File -> New Screenshot option now invokes
    platform-specific tools (the XDG screenshot portal on Linux, and the screenshot
    tool on maCOS). This is currently unsupported on Windows
  - When building Pinta using the Makefile, 'dotnet publish' is now run during the build step rather than the install step.
  - Added a "Reseed" button for the random noise used by several effects (such as "Add Noise" and "Frosted Glass"). Previously,
    the noise pattern changed every time the effect was computed (including when other parameters were changed).
  - Saving an image already saved in a format that supports multiple layers to a format that does not support layers will now
    explicitly prompt the user to flatten the image before saving, rather than silently flattening it (#909)
  - The add-in manager dialog now filters out old versions incompatible with the current version of Pinta, or new addins requiring
    future version of Pinta (#1580205)
  - The tool windows on the right side of the dock layout can now be completely hidden (#1179)

  ### Fixed

  - Twist effect applied locally based on selection instead of entire image (#1089)
  - Zoom blur effect now zooms inside the image's bounds instead of way outside of them (#1125)
  - Fixed issues where the system language settings on macOS did not properly take effect in Pinta (#1976178)
  - Fixed an issue where the Pan tool's cursor could show up as a missing icon (#2013047)
  - Fixed errors when saving a file that was opened with a missing or incorrect extension (#2013050)
  - Fixed a bug where certain layer opacity settings could be incorrectly rounded (#2020596)
  - Fixed bugs in the shape tools and the Lasso Select tool which prevented the last row and column of the image from being used (#467)
  - Fixed issues where the Curves dialog could not easily edit existing control points (#1973602)
  - Fixed a bug where dragging a control point in the Curves dialog could unexpectedly erase other control points (#1973602)
  - Improved error handling when loading incompatible add-ins (#2047274)
  - The Clone Stamp tool no longer resets the destination offset after each stroke (#2031257)
  - Fixed potential errors when pasting in the text tool if the clipboard didn't contain text (#2047495)

  - Fixed layout issues in the effect dialogs (#2049937)
  - Fixed a bug where the Flip Horizontal / Vertical items in the Image menu incorrectly activated the Layer menu's flip actions (#2051430)

  - The Text tool now supports configuring whether antialiasing is enabled (#935)
  - Fixed various artifacts in the shape tools, particularly with larger brush widths (#733, #955)
  - Fixed an issue where the text tool did not immediately redraw after changes to the font or color of unfinalized text (#952, #975)
  - Fixed an issue where the text tool could unexpectedly redraw existing text with the latest palette color, or fail to finalize uncommitted text (#1097, #1176)
  - Fixed a bug where cut / paste operations did not behave as expected with complex selections (#951, #978)
  - Fixed transparency behavior for several effects (#1184, #1229)
