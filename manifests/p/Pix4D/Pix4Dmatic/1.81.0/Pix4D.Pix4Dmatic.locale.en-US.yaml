ShortDescription: Next generation photogrammetry software for professional drone and terrestrial mapping
Tags:
- 3d
- photogrammetry
ReleaseNotes: |-
  New Capabilities
  - Faster mesh generation: Mesh generation is 20% faster in version 1.81 when compared to earlier versions.
  Additional Updates and Improvements
  - Polygons passed to the DSM generation are now used to estimate the automatic region of interest
  - The mesh quality setting is now saved in the processing template
  - Improved densification normals quality for some datasets, mostly drone datasets with larger GSD.
  - Better point cloud completeness for mixed aerial and terrestrial datasets
  - Improved performance when adding new layers, placing markers, and creating geometry in projects with a large number of existing layers
  - Improve the zoom behavior in the 3D view when using a touchpad
  Bug Fixes
  - Paths have been removed from processing templates
  - Bug fixes in DSM generation
  - Fixed an issue where some onboardings in the toolbar would be shown again after confirmation
  - Fixed "Import images from folder" not working
  - Fixed bad GCP matches being added by default to the merge projects dialog
  - Fixed images being non-square in the full-screen view of the image viewer
  - Fixed an issue where automarking would fail to properly center images in full-screen mode
  - Fixed some UI components being disabled after a failed import of a Pix4Dmapper project
  - Fixed JPEG compressed TIFF images not being displayed in the image viewer
  - Fixed an issue where the Welcome view did not suggest a project CRS based on the imported images when a default CRS was set and the corresponding checkbox was unchecked
  - Fixed some issues related to the inventory snapshots of the custom report:
    - Volumes are now rendered with the volume tin
    - Circles are now always fully visible
  - Fixed an issue where the point cloud registration onboarding would be hidden if the content panel is docked to the right or as a window
  - Fixed an issue where the export image geolocations & orientations dialog would truncate text for some languages
  - Fixed an issue where closing some projects while they are currently loading could cause a crash and data loss.
  - Fixed a crash that would occurr when creating geometries in the 2D view if automatic tie points were not loaded
  - Fixed an issue where layers would stay disabled after editing a vertex
  - Layers, point clouds, and orthomosaics that are importing or processing no longer show in the content panel until they are finished
  - Fixed the UI freezing when selecting a large closed polyline
