ReleaseNotes: |-
  1.86.0
  Additional Updates and Improvements
  - The “Process in PIX4Dcloud” workflow now uses the current coordinates from the camera table, enabling the processing of images where geolocation was imported (e.g., via CSV) or modified
  - Added undo/redo support for vertex placement when drawing geometries and ortho patches in the 2D view
  - Unified the behavior of the Esc and Enter keys across all 2D creation tools (ROI, orthomosaic patches, polylines, and polygons) and selection modes
  - Coordinates in the status bar now display the elevation at the hovered location in both display and project CRS units
  - Views in the custom report now preserve the original projection mode (perspective or orthographic)
  - Automatic tie points (ATPs) are no longer affected by Terrain or ASPRS class coloring and visibility settings
  Information
  - Small GeoTIFF files are exported again in a standard TIFF format compatible with mainstream viewers.
  Bug fixes
  - Fixed an issue where a backup file created by a newer version of the software was incorrectly deleted when opening the project in an older version
  - Fixed an issue where invalid coordinate or orientation accuracies were not replaced by default values when importing OPF or PIX4Dmapper projects
  - Fixed an issue where importing image geolocation reset the position accuracy to default values if the imported file did not contain accuracy data
  - Fixed an issue where orthomosaic patches could be misplaced in certain cases when the orthomosaic was generated using a region of interest
  - Fixed an issue where measurement labels in the 2D view did not update when changing the display unit
  - Fixed an issue where the region of interest (ROI) interfered with drawing polylines in the 2D view
  - Fixed the color of the polygon preview in the 2D view when the active layer is hidden
  - Fixed an issue where the DSM was hidden and displayed incorrect elevations when reopening projects with non-metric units
  - Fixed an issue where “Process in PIX4Dcloud” incorrectly geolocated projects using left-handed coordinate systems
  - Fixed an issue where the column format in the import dialogs did not consistently update to reflect the selected columns
  - Increased the size of the scale constraint input field to accommodate up to 6 digits
  - Fixed an issue that caused LAS and XYZ point cloud exports to be empty when filtering by an ASPRS class
  - Fixed an issue where the image viewer did not correctly sort images to show those with marks on top when selecting a marker
  - Fixed an issue that prevented inserting a vertex on a polyline edge between two vertex tie points (VTPs) in the 2D view
  - Improved the logic for the auto-selection of point cloud inputs in the processing panel to prevent invalid configurations when applying templates
  - Fixed an issue where the progress bar would run from 0% to 100% twice during DSM creation when using automatic tie points (ATPs) as the input
  - Fixed an issue where uncalibrated cameras were not correctly displayed as input cameras after removing the project calibration
  - Fixed an issue where moving a polygon between layers could result in duplicate polygon names
  - Fixed an issue related to the minimum and maximum values in the exported DSM, which made it incompatible with some third-party software.
  - Fixed an issue where non-fatal internal errors could cause the densification process to fail
  - Fixed a crash that could occur during mesh generation when estimating the point cloud scale
  - Fixed an issue where PIX4Dcloud project links, generated after sharing or processing, would not open a web browser

  1.85.0
  New Capabilities
  - Added a new dialog to select both the organization and license type after logging in
  - Custom ASPRS classes can now have their id set manually
  - The orthomosaic generation now respects the region of interest (ROI), allowing the orthomosaic area to be restricted without regenerating the DSM
  - Added an “Ortho mode” button to the section view toolbar to easily toggle 90-degree angle vectorization
  - Added Ukrainian as an available language
  Additional Updates and Improvements
  - Split processing options in the processing panel, moving advanced settings under a new "More options" button
  - Updated the processing option logic in the PIX4Dcloud "Process" tab:
    - The "PIX4Dcatch" option is now disabled for drone-only projects
    - Mixed (drone + PIX4Dcatch) projects now default to "Nadir" and display a warning, as this combination is not officially supported. The "Oblique" and "PIX4Dcatch" options remain enabled
  - Added a validation to block project uploads to PIX4Dcloud if the horizontal and vertical CRS units do not match
  - Improved the mesh generation to avoid gaps between adjacent tiles
  - Improved the mesh generation for merged projects to better handle varying point cloud densities
  - Made several improvements to the orthomosaic editor:
    - The visibility of patch borders can now be controlled independently from the patch content
    - Patches are now always rendered as flat horizontal polygons in the image viewer
  - Added an option to export the orthomosaic without transparency to improve compatibility with third-party software
  - Updated the drag-and-drop behavior for folders: project files (e.g., .opf) are now detected and opened directly, which also allows for opening multiple projects in one operation
  - Improved camera support:
    - Added more robust focal length reading from EXIF data
    - Included support for Skydio-specific GPS accuracy
    - Refined minimum GPS accuracy for DJI cameras
  - Updated project calibration behavior to properly integrate GCPs for georeferencing when input DJI RTK imagery is tagged with too-high geotag accuracies
  - Added new menu options to the ASPRS class panel to toggle class visibility, switch between RGB/monochrome view, and remove classification
  - Polygon vertex tie-points are now rendered in the 2D view
  - The quality report now correctly displays the DSM interpolation strategy
  - Added support for two new geoid models:
    - Norway/Svalbard: Svalbard_EGG2015_2024
    - Netherlands/Bonaire: BONGEO2004
  - Changed the "Add keyframe" shortcut to Ctrl+K
  - Updated the user account menu: "Organizations" is now "Organizations & licenses", "Licenses" is now "Plan and licenses", and icons were added for external links
  - Improved the error message when trying to re-upload to a project with a different CRS
  Bug fixes
  - Fixed a crash that could occur when exporting an orthomosaic with large empty regions into multiple tiles
  - Fixed an issue where DSM generation could get stuck or crash when using the “Expand area” option if all point cloud points were above the cameras
  - Fixed an issue that prevented users from entering certain characters in the custom report input fields
  - Fixed an issue where the sky background would flicker in orthographic mode
  - Fixed several issues related to mesh generation:
    - Corrected an issue that could cause the surface to be trimmed too aggressively in datasets with very different point cloud densities
    - Addressed a rare issue where the mesh generation algorithm could spend considerable time estimating the point cloud density
    - Resolved an issue that caused long processing times during mesh generation for non-axis-aligned corridor projects
