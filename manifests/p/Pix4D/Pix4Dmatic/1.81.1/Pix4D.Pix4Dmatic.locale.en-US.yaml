  New Capabilities
  - Faster mesh generation:Â Mesh generation is 20% faster in version 1.81 when compared to earlier versions.
  Additional Updates and Improvements
  - Polygons passed to the DSM generation are now used to estimate the automatic region of interest
  - The mesh quality setting is now saved in the processing template
  - Improved densification normals quality for some datasets, mostly drone datasets with larger GSD.
  - Better point cloud completeness for mixed aerial and terrestrial datasets
  - Improved performance when adding new layers, placing markers, and creating geometry in projects with a large number of existing layers
  - Improve the zoom behavior in the 3D view when using a touchpad
  Bug Fixes
  - Paths have been removed from processing templates
  - Bug fixes in DSM generation
  - Fixed an issue where some onboardings in the toolbar would be shown again after confirmation

    - Circles are now always fully visible
  - Fixed an issue where the point cloud registration onboarding would be hidden if the content panel is docked to the right or as a window
  - Fixed an issue where the export image geolocations & orientations dialog would truncate text for some languages
  - Fixed an issue where closing some projects while they are currently loading could cause a crash and data loss.
  - Fixed a crash that would occur when creating geometries in the 2D view if automatic tie points were not loaded
  - Fixed an issue where layers would stay disabled after editing a vertex
  - Layers, point clouds, and orthomosaics that are importing or processing no longer show in the content panel until they are finished
