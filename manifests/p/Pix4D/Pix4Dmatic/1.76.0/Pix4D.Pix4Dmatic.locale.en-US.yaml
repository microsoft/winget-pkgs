ReleaseNotes: |-
  What's new
  - User confirmation is now requested before canceling a point cloud import
  - Added a new geoid model:
    - Japan: JPGEO2024
  - Point clouds without normals can no longer be selected as input for the mesh generation
  - Saving a copy of the project (File>Save copy…) now also saves a copy of the unsaved active processing template (template.json)
  - Updated the point cloud point size slider to use a logarithmic scale
  - The point cloud import dialog can now be resized
  - The quality report is now available in German
  - Added an onboarding GIF for the point cloud manual registration tool
  - When a user cancels a project upload and the corresponding PIX4Dcloud project was not previously created, it will be removed
  Bug fixes and improvements
  - Fixed an issue where tie points could not be marked on uncalibrated images in projects using an arbitrary CRS
  - Restored the section line display in the image viewer when selecting a section geometry node
  - Fixed an issue that prevented the dense point cloud generation in a merged project created in versions 1.74 or 1.75
  - Fixed the update of the reprojection errors in the tie point table when importing marks while calibration is running
  - Fixed the issue with automatic processing template and settings selection failing for projects in ft or ftUS
  - Fixed an issue that prevented point clouds from becoming outdated when adding/editing tie points
  - Resolved an issue preventing the drag-and-drop functionality for LAS/LAZ files within a project
  - Fixed orthoplane issues:
    - The orthoplane pixel size now updates correctly when switching display units
    - Resolved an issue where the orthoplane pixel size used an incorrect value for processing when display units were set to feet
    - Fixed a rendering issue affecting small, low-resolution orthoplanes in the section view
  - Fixed an issue where mesh generation was incorrectly enabled when no calibrated cameras were available
  - Processing templates will now store and restore export paths relative to the project folder
  - Fixed the issue where the "Gaussian Splat" upload option was occasionally incorrectly enabled or disabled due to a bug in detecting whether the cloud "credits" feature was active in the user’s account
  - Fixed the issue where PIX4Dmatic/PIX4Dsurvey occasionally uploaded projects to the user's "default" organization instead of the organization chosen via the "Switch organization" tool
  - Fixed an issue where "Process in PIX4Dcloud" sometimes uploaded inconsistent tie point accuracy values, leading to processing failures in PIX4Dcloud
  Known issues
  - The SLPK mesh export format was temporarily removed for scalable meshes due to exporting issues
