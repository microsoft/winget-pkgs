ReleaseNotes: |-
  The pgAdmin Development Team is pleased to announce pgAdmin 4 version 9.0. This release of pgAdmin 4 includes 25 bug fixes and new features. For more details please see the release notes.
  Note:(Windows only)
  In this release, the 'vX' suffix has been removed from the application name. You will now see 'pgAdmin 4' as the app name. Starting from version 8, we also removed the 'vX' folder from the default installation path, allowing users to seamlessly upgrade to major versions. As a result of this change, if version 8 is already installed on the machine, the uninstaller will first run, followed by the installation of version 9.
  Notable changes in this release include:
  Features:
  - Enhanced pgAdmin 4 with support for Workspace layouts.
  Starting with this release, pgAdmin introduces two layout options: the Classic layout, a familiar design users know well, and the new Workspace layout, which provides a streamlined, distraction-free environment with dedicated areas for the Query Tool, PSQL, and Schema Diff tools. The Workspace layout is set as the default, but users can easily switch to the Classic layout through the preferences. In the Workspace layout, the Query Tool, PSQL, and Schema Diff tabs are organized and opened within their respective workspaces for a more focused experience.
  - Added the MAINTAIN privilege for PostgreSQL version 17 and above.
  - Add support for OAuth2 profile array response, which handles the GitHub Private Email ID issue.
  - Change button labels and color in the delete confirmation dialog for all objects to improve UX.
  Bugs/Housekeeping:
  - Fixed an issue where pgadmin cannot install into the path with non-ASCII characters.
  - Fixed an issue where filter dialog save fails when the PostgreSQL server/database connection is lost.
  - Fixed an issue where an error message from the database server needs space between two sentences.
  - Fixed an issue where the query tool throws utf-8 decode error when using a cursor with binary data.
  - Fixed an issue where the option key was not registering in the PSQL tool.
  - Fixed an issue where copying query tool output cell is not working if any SQL text is selected.
  - Remove the option "With no data (concurrently)" from the Refresh MATERIALIZED VIEW context menu.
  - Fixed an issue where Default Privileges and Privileges not working correctly.
  - Fixed an issue where quotes were missing in the CREATE script for the tablespace.
  - Change the logic of the setval function, so that the next nextval of sequence will return exactly the specified value.
