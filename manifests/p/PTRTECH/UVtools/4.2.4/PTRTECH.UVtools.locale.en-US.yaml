ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Setting - MaxDegreeOfParallelism:
  - (Add) Value -2: Will utilize an optimal number in order to relief some load and therefore preventing the computer from lags and freezes, mostly this is the processor core count less a few.
    The more cores the CPU haves the larger is the margin up to a limit. (Optimal/Recommended)
  - (Add) Value 0: Will utilize the processor core count. (Fast/Performance).
    Note that 0 is only equal to Max if you don't change your CPU or translate settings to other machine.
  - (Change) ! preset will set the value as would the -2 in the runtime.
    However it's recommended to use -2 instead of the fixed positive number
  - (Change) Default value from -1 to -2 (For current users is recommended to change to -2)
  - Tool - Stir resin:
  - (Add) Option to output a dummy pixel
  - (Add) Exposure time setting to allow to set the time of layer exposure
  - (Add) Informative text warning about the fact that each stir will increase in height due no ability to run layers in same Z position
  - (Add) Tooltips on the labels
  - (Improvement) Always allow the tool to run even if applied before
  - (Improvement) Do not allow to run the tool when stir number multiplied by layer height pass the set lift height when running on printers with no ability to run layers in same Z position
  - (Improvement) Instead of grey out incompatible fields, hide them and show the text (Incompatible with the current printer / file format)
  - (Add) Benchmark tool: Allow to change thread count for the multi-thread test
