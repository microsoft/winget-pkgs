ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Layers:
  - (Add) Brotli compression codec with good performance and compression ratio (Choose it if you have low available RAM)
  - (Improvement) Use ResizableMemory instead of MemoryStream for GZip and Deflate compressions, this results in faster compressions and less memory pressure
  - (Improvement) Changed how layers are cached into the memory, before they were compressed and save for the whole image.
    Now it crops the bitmap to the bounding rectangle of the current layer and save only that portion with pixels.
  - Issues Detection:
  - (Fix) When detecting for Islands but not overhangs it will throw an exception about invalid roi
  - (Fix) Huge memory leak when detecting resin traps (#830)
  - (Improvement) Core: Changed the way "Roi" method is returned and try to dispose all it instances
  - (Fix) EncryptedCTB, GOO, SVGX: Huge memory leak when decoding files that caused the program to crash (#830)
  - (Fix) UI: Missing theme styles
  - (Fix) PrusaSlicer profiles for Creality Halot Mage's: Enable the "Horizontal" mirror under the "Printer" tab to produce the correct orientation when printing (#827)
