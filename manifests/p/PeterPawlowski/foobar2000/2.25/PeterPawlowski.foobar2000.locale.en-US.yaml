ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Built-in UPnP media renderer, both client (play to another device) and server (be controlled by another device).
    - Other foobar2000 instances on your local network, with UPnP remote control feature active, will be listed as output devices.
    - foobar2000-to-foobar2000 playback shows tags with album covers on the other end, using Ogg FLAC as stream container.
  - Media Library improvements, most notably:
    - Can natively index FTP/WebDAV/SMB network shares.
    - Improved response to enabling/disabling/installing/uninstalling decoders - only reloads info from affected music files.
  - Codecs, most notably:
    - FFmpeg updated to 8.0, added native support for xHE-AAC decoding.
    - Rewritten Ogg FLAC tag handling, properly implemented embedded album art.
    - Fixed ReplayGain tags not being saved in multichapter Ogg/Opus files.
  - Portable install improvements
    - Changed the way relative paths are handled, so cached tags are no longer forgotten after relaunching from a different path.
    - Made possible so specify no-cover pics as relative path to install location.
  - Converter:
    - Enabled RF64 writing.
    - Fixed Converter failing to function until foobar2000 restart after removal of %TEMP%\foo_converter.
  - Other
    - Added preferences page for network share credentials so you don't have to place them in URLs anymore.
    - Made editing DSP settings momentarily lower output latency to make DSPs appear more responsive.
    - Fixed Properties 'rewrite tags' not working if nothing has been edited.
    - Installer is now hi-DPI friendly.
    - Made system file dialogs invoked out-of-process, to avoid stability issues.
  - See release notes for full list of changes.
