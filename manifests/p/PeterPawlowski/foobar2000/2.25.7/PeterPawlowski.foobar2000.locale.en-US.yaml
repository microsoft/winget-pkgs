ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Fixed portable relative path handling bug affecting having portable foobar2000 itself as indexed music folder.
  - Fixed Direct2D visualization race condition bug resulting in random instability.
  - Rebuilt FFmpeg without MSVC /fp:fast, which fixes a mis-compilation bug that resulted in crashing on Wine.
  - Fixed default AccurateRip log save location not being reliably set to scanned album folder.
  - Improved behavior of Advanced Limiter, made sure it resumes outputting bit identical signal after attenuation.
  - Internet Radio: Worked around radio-browser site not working as documented, all tags get fetched again.
  - Fixed a bug in SMB code that prevented password-less user logins (other than guest user) from working.
  - Fixed horrible regression in FPL serialization code that caused nonsensical output when copying or drag&dropping playlist contents between foobar2000 instances using relative paths.
