ReleaseNotes: |-
  • Removed gnudb from default online tagger settings, as gnudb now demands users to input their actual email addresses.
    ◦ If you wish to use gnudb, you can configure it manually, but we strongly recommend against it.
    ◦ Online tagger now defaults to freedb.dbpoweramp.com which works once again.
    ◦ Changed storage of freedb-compatible server list settings, to a text file in profile folder.
  • Reverted compiler to Visual Studio 2019, as current version of Visual Studio 2022 outputs AVX opcodes when explicitly configured not to, making foobar2000 crash on old PCs.
  • ReFacets added "last modified" column, fixed playlist interaction bugs.
  • Converter: Fail harder if "don't reset DSP between tracks" is on and one of files can't be converted - output past the point of failure wasn't valid anymore anyway.
  • Fixed WASAPI Exclusive timing glitches with exotic settings.
