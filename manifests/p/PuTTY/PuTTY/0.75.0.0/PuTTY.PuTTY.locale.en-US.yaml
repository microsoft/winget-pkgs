ReleaseNotes: |-
  • Security fix: on Windows, a server could DoS the whole Windows GUI by telling the PuTTY window to change its title repeatedly at high speed.
  • Pageant now supports loading a key still encrypted, and decrypting it later by prompting for the passphrase on first use.
  • Upgraded default SSH key fingerprint format to OpenSSH-style SHA-256.
  • Upgraded private key file format to PPK3, with improved passphrase hashing and no use of SHA-1.
  • Terminal now supports ESC [ 9 m for strikethrough text.
  • New protocols: bare ssh-connection layer for use over already-secure IPC channels, and SUPDUP for talking to very old systems such as PDP-10s.
  • PuTTYgen now supports alternative provable-prime generation algorithm for RSA and DSA.
  • The Unix tools can now connect directly to a Unix-domain socket.
