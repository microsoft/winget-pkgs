ReleaseNotes: |-
  • Security fix: if an SSH server accepted an offer of a public key and then rejected the signature, PuTTY could access freed memory, if the key had come from an SSH agent.
  • Security feature: new config option to disable PuTTY's dynamic host key preference policy, if you prefer to avoid giving away to eavesdroppers which hosts you have stored keys for.
  • Bug fix: the installer UI was illegible in Windows high-contrast mode.
  • Bug fix: console password input failed on Windows 7.
  • Bug fixes in the terminal: one instance of the dreaded "line==NULL" error box, and two other assertion failures.
  • Bug fix: potential memory-consuming loop in bug-compatible padding of an RSA signature from an agent.
  • Bug fix: PSFTP's buffer handling worked badly with some servers (particularly proftpd's mod_sftp).
  • Bug fix: cursor could be wrongly positioned when restoring from the alternate terminal screen. (A bug of this type was fixed in 0.59; this is a case that that fix missed.)
  • Bug fix: character cell height could be a pixel too small when running GTK PuTTY on Ubuntu 20.04 (or any other system with a similarly up-to-date version of Pango).
  • Bug fix: old-style (low resolution) scroll wheel events did not work in GTK 3 PuTTY. This could stop the scroll wheel working at all in VNC.
