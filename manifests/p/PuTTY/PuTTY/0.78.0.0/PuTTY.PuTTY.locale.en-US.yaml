ReleaseNotes: |
  • Support for OpenSSH certificates, for both user authentication keys and host keys. • New SSH proxy modes, for running a custom shell command or subsystem on the proxy server instead of forwarding a port through it. • New plugin system to allow a helper program to provide responses in keyboard-interactive authentication, intended to automate one-time password systems. • Support for NTRU Prime post-quantum key exchange, • Support for AES-GCM (in the OpenSSH style rather than RFC 5647). • Support for more forms of Diffie-Hellman key exchange: new larger integer groups (such as group16 and group18), and support for using those and ECDH with GSSAPI. • Bug fix: the 32-bit Windows build now runs on Windows XP again. • Bug fix: server-controlled window title setting now works again even if the character set is ISO 8859 (or a few other affected single-byte character sets). • Bug fix: certain forms of OSC escape sequences (sent by some real servers) could cause PuTTY to crash. • Bug fix: the -pwfile/-pw options no longer affect local key passphrase prompts, and no longer suppress Plink's anti-spoofing measures.
