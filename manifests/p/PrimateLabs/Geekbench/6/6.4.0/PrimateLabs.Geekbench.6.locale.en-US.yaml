ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Introduce support for RISC-V Vector Extensions.
    - Geekbench 6.4 introduces support for RISC-V Vector Extensions, boosting the performance of workloads that leverage SIMD instructions when run on RISC-V CPUs that implement RVV.
  - Improve support for Arm Scalable Matrix Extensions instructions.
    - Previously, Geekbench 6.3 Scalable Matrix Extensions (SME) support required CPUs to implement both SME and SME2 instructions. Geekbench 6.4 SME support now requires CPUs to either implement SME instructions or implement SME and SME2 instructions, improving compatibility and performance for upcoming CPU releases.
  - Report instruction set usage.
    - Geekbench 6.4 now reports the instruction set extensions detected and used during the CPU Benchmark (e.g., AVX2, AVX512, SME, and RVV). These reports provide insight into which instruction sets Geekbench uses during performance measurement.
  - Improve CPU topology detection on Linux.
    - Geekbench 6.4 improves CPU topology detection on Linux, in particular enhancing detection on systems with ARM and RISC-V processors.

  Geekbench 6.4 scores are comparable with Geekbench 6.3 scores. Geekbench 6.4 is a recommended update for all Geekbench 6 users.
