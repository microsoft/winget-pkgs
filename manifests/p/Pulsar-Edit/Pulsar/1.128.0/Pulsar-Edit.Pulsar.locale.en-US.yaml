  Pulsar v1.128.0: May There Be a Spring in Your Step!
  Hello, folks. Another month or so, another Pulsar release!
  We've got performance improvements, an improved editing experience for RTL languages, and comment handling for JSON and JSONC files. Please also be aware this month's release contains a security fix, so do update when you can. Thank you to the reporter of this issue.
  As always, a huge thank you to our community, contributors, and donations.
  Happy coding, and see you amongst the stars!
  - The Pulsar Team
  - Vastly improved support for right-to-left text editing — meaning languages like Arabic, Hebrew, and Farsi.
  - Added support for comments in JSON — both via a new grammar for .jsonc files and via a setting to enable comments in regular .json files.
  - Fixed performance issues that can arise when reopening a project with existing editor windows.
  - Updated DOMPurify. This is a security fix.
