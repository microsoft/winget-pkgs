ReleaseNotes: |-
  Hello, and welcome, one and all! This release brings the long-awaited (and long-previewed in our Rolling releases) upgrade to Electron 30 to our stable "Regular" releases!
  Catching up, at least somewhat, with the rapid pace of new Electron versions is a goal we've been actively working on since we started Pulsar almost 4 years ago. We're happy to make one of the larger steps in that direction since we began with this release (from Electron 12 to Electron 30.) We recognize that Electron 30 is still not the latest Electron version, but it took a tremendous amount of work to get here, and we are still working diligently on further upgrades.
  On a more business-as-usual note, we also have several language/grammar improvements, various bugfixes and miscellaneous improvements. Please see the full changelog below for details.
  We're very excited for this milestone, and please do let us know if anything needs fixing -- this was a huge undertaking under the hood! (Did we mention the accompanying blog post?: https://blog.pulsar-edit.dev/posts/20251202-savetheclocktower-pulsar-on-electron-30/)
  As always, a huge thank you to our community, contributors, and donations.
  Happy coding, and see you amongst the stars!
  - The Pulsar Team

  ## 1.131.0

  Because this is such a huge upgrade to Pulsar, some of your community packages may be affected!
  If you handle distributions for Pulsar as a community maintainer make sure to read this changelog carefully to make things compatible!
  For more information, read [Pulsar on Electron 30: what it means for you](https://blog.pulsar-edit.dev/posts/20251202-savetheclocktower-pulsar-on-electron-30/).

  - Update Electron to version 30!
    * Node is now version 20.11.1
    * Chromium is now version 124
    * This means better performance, better Node library compatibility, and ability for community packages to use newer features of Chromium.
    * It should also vastly improve the Pulsar experience for Linux users in Wayland environments.
    * Because this is such a big upgrade, some of your community packages might be affected!
  - Bump ppm to use Node 20.11.1
    * For the first time in a long time, both ppm and Pulsar are using the same version of Node; this should avoid some rare bugs encountered when installing certain packages.
  - Fix handling when opening files to certain line numbers via CLI - e.g. pulsar foo.txt:30.
  - Prevent packages from spawning new background tasks if the environment is unloading (as would happen during a window reload or while quitting Pulsar).
  - [find-and-replace] Fix an issue where certain files would show results in a project-wide search even when they would be excluded by the file/directory pattern.
  - [markdown-preview] Fix situations where "Save as HTML" and "Copy as HTML" silently failed with certain kinds of content.
  - [autocomplete-plus] Prevent certain kinds of suggestions from being incorrectly filtered out of the result set.
  - [language-java] Update to the latest tree-sitter-java parser, adding support for multiline strings, among other things.
  - [language-python] Better highlighting of except clauses; fixed folding of certain if blocks.
  - [language-typescript] Better highlighting of template literals; adding folding of interface and enum blocks.
  - [language-javascript] Proper highlighting of JSX with namespaced attributes.

  #### Changes for Electron 30
  > Internals of 'Update to Electron 30' PR

  - Remove all support for legacy Tree-sitter
  - Prefer @electron/remote, deprecate direct usage of electron.remote and switch all internal usages to @electron/remote.
  - Decaffeinate tree-view
  - Fix a failing autocomplete-plus spec
  - Get dev-live-reload specs passing
  - Get image-view specs passing
  - [language-ruby] Add a basic grammar test spec
  - [markdown-preview] Get specs passing
  - [settings-view] Get specs passing
  - Point to Electron 30.0.9 and point our dependencies to the NPM-published versions under the @pulsar-edit namespace that are compatible with Electron 30.0.9.
  - Fix some TextEditorComponent issues related to changes in Chromium sometime between Electron 12 and Electron 30.
  - Eliminate reliance on typescript-simple in favor of a custom solution that uses the typescript package directly.
  - Consume get-scrollbar-style to replace the deprecated scrollbar-style module
  - Additional changes related to device pixel ratio that probably should have gone in the earlier commit.
  - Add the ability to report crashes via Electron's standard crashReporter interface.
  - Delete deprecated "app.allowRendererProcessReuse = false"
  - Enable @electron-remote for the given window during startup and disable a Blink experimental feature that was causing trouble with package compatibility (because it added an on method to all DOM nodes!).
  - Be more paranoid about release channels in a handful of places in case we want to maintain a next (or nightly or preview) release channel on an ongoing basis.
  - Cache Language instances in web-tree-sitter so that the specs don't run out of memory.
  - Preserve an ATOM_CHANNEL environment variable if it exists and other changes related to release-channel agnosticism.
  - [snippets] Get specs passing
  - [spell-check] Get specs passing and abandon atom-pathspec in favor of an internal implementation.
  - [tabs] Fix an exception that can happen in unusual scenarios when the browser can't give us an element under a given X/Y coordinate.
  - [update-package-dependencies] Get specs passing
  - [symbol-provider-tree-sitter] Unmock clock in the standard way
  - Remove outdated Tree-sitter documentation
  - Update GitHub Actions CI jobs to include Wayland-related keyboard dependencies.
  - Update CirrusCI build job to include Wayland-related keyboard dependencies.
  - Revert to a single entitlements.plist now that we're no longer affected by the awful libuv bug that was present in Electron 12.
  - Update script/electron-builder.js to support a couple of command-line switches and to build correctly for Electron 30.
  - Fix ThemeManager specs
  - Define two methods on the atom global to work around tree-view issues related to trashing and revealing items in electron.shell.
  - Comment reformatting
  - Some integration test fixes
  - Fix PackageManager specs
  - Use yarn.lock from updated-latest-electron branch
  - Swallow exceptions raised by pending tests
  - Disallow if( and the like in .eslitrc
  - Add submodules: true back into certain workflows
  - Remove atom.trashItem and atom.showItemInFolder since they weren't even being used. The equivalent functions from the shell module of @electron/remote have been performing the same task in PulsarNext for a while now.
  - Update ppm to commit d288b0978b35f7c0ffb3dc5c1e50c
  - Update ppm to commit 07faba10096ee4239ce671218d9953fb2e40ecbf
