ReleaseNotes: |-
  Pulsar 1.130.1 (Hotfix Release)
  Hotfix: Restore Windows app to working condition, after it was mis-built in v1.130.0.
  Description of the issue affecting v1.130.0 on Windows: The Windows version of the app was broken, 
  due to its native C/C++ dependencies remaining built for NodeJS when electron-rebuild failed, 
  and due to our CI being mistakenly configured in a way that hid the failure. 
  Electron-rebuild failed in CI due to a missing Windows 10 SDK.
  Resolution: We have worked around the missing Windows 10 SDK issue in CI by installing it manually, 
  and also updated our CI workflow so that a failure of electron-rebuild would be more likely to be caught.
  Note: Binaries for macOS and Linux are also provided to make it simple to find the latest binaries 
  for all platforms attached to one GitHub Release. Other than coming from a new CI run with a new 
  patch version bump, there should be no other changes from v1.130.0 on macOS or Linux.
  See v1.130.0 "Spooktacular Edition" for new features: website revamp with
  improved docs/API, Tree-sitter/language updates, autocomplete improvements,
  experimental i18n support, tree-view focus fix on Windows, and emmet compatibility.
  Happy coding, and see you amongst the stars!
