ReleaseNotes: |-
  Hotfix: Restore Windows app to working condition, after it was mis-built in v1.130.0.
  Description of the issue affecting v1.130.0 on Windows: The Windows version of the app was broken, due to its native C/C++ dependencies remaining built for NodeJS when electron-rebuild failed, and due to our CI being mistakenly configured in a way that hid the failure. Electron-rebuild failed in CI due to a missing Windows 10 SDK.
  Resolution: We have worked around the missing Windows 10 SDK issue in CI by installing it manually, and also updated our CI workflow so that a failure of electron-rebuild would be more likely to be caught.
  Note: Binaries for macOS and Linux are also provided to make it simple to find the latest binaries for all platforms attached to one GitHub Release. Other than coming from a new CI run with a new patch version bump, there should be no other changes from v1.130.0 on macOS or Linux.
