  Pulsar 1.129.0: An August Occasion
  Howdy folks,
  Another fine Pulsar release, Pulsar 1.129.0, is available for your use and enjoyment. See changelog below for details.
  A big shout-out to @Drsheppard01 for their first contribution in the form of PR #1241, and to @jmanuel1 for the issue report #1302 that led to a quick fix from @savetheclocktower in PR #1303. And to several members of the community who have given feedback on GitHub, Discord, etc.
  As always, a huge thank you to our community, contributors, and donations.
  Happy coding, and see you amongst the stars!
  - The Pulsar Team

  - Some minor Tree-sitter fixes, including fixing a bug in SCSS highlighting and ensuring proper highlighting support for abstract methods in TypeScript.
  - When viewing a file that exists on disk outside of your project root, you may now use Tree View: Rename to “import” it into your project folder by giving it a relative path.
  - Updated various dependencies for security reasons.
  - Updated AppImages to type 2 runtime -- libfuse is no-longer required to be installed on the end-user's system to use Pulsar's AppImages!
