  What's Changed
  - Fixes occasional issue where items in the "Fetch" page would fail to correctly scan the files & show "Loading..." forever. Also a speed bump to the file scanning.
  - Fixes a few things that've been annoying for a while by @neil-morrison44 in #358
      - The "next" and "previous" buttons in the screenshot view now actually do different things instead of both being previous
      - Image Packs are now sorted by most-populated & when looking at images for a single platform ones without that platform aren't shown
      - The "fetch" part will no longer incorrectly show progress bars on all items instead of just the one that's being fetched
      - If a core has multiple cores within a zip there's now UI for enabling each core individually. Note: this doesn't fix it silently downloading all the bundled cores when updating one.
      - Show MSX in the games list (or any core that has entries in data.json that aren't required but start with "Slot")
  - Bulgarian language added by @toto99303 in #357
  - Adds a way to view the changelog by @neil-morrison44 in #359
      - "What's new?" button on the about screen
  New Contributors
  - @toto99303 made their first contribution in #357
