  Added:
  - Support for workspaces inspired by Cargo Workspaces
  - Dependency group support.
  - The version and project metadata commands now support projects that do not use Hatchling as the build backend

  - Build environments can now be configured, the default build environment is hatch-build
  - The environment interface now has the following methods and properties in order to better support builds on remote machines: project_root, sep, pathsep, fs_context
