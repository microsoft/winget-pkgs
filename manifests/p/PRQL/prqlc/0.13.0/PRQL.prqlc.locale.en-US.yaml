ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Parentheses are always required around pipelines, even within tuples.
    For example:
  - prqlc compile --debug-log=log.html will generate an HTML file with a detailed log of the compilation process. (@aljazerzen, #4646)
  - Added prqlc debug json-schema command to auto-generate JSON Schema representations of commonly exposed IR types such as PL and RQ. (@kgutwin, #4698)
  - Add documentation comments to the output of the documentation generator. (@vanillajonathan, #4729)
  - Add CLI syntax highlighting to prqlc.
    You can try it as prqlc experimental highlight example.prql. (@vanillajonathan, #4755)
  - Using in with an empty array pattern (e.g. expr | in []) will now output a constant false condition instead of an expr IN (), which is syntactically invalid in some SQL dialects (@Globidev, #4598)
  - The Snap package previously released on the edge channel is now released on the stable channel. (@vanillajonathan, #4784)
  - Major reorganization of prqlc-parser â€” prqlc-ast is merged into prqlc-parser, and prqlc-parser's files are rearranged, including its exports.
    This is part of an effort to modularize the compiler by stage, reducing the amount of context that's required to understand a single stage.
    There will likely be some further changes (more detail in the PR description). (@m-span, #4634)
  - This is a breaking change for any libraries that depend on prqlc-parser (which should be fairly rare).
  - Renamed prql-compiler-macros to prqlc-macros for consistency with other crates (@max-sixty, #4565)
  - prql-compiler, the old name for prqlc, is removed as a facade to prqlc. It had been deprecated for a few versions and will no longer be updated. (@max-sixty)
  - New benchmarks (@max-sixty, #4654)
  - @Globidev, with #4598
