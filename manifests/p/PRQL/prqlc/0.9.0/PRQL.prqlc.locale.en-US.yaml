ReleaseNotes: |-
  - The major breaking change is a new syntax for lists, which have been renamed to _tuples_, and are now represented with braces {} rather than brackets [].
  - Some significant changes regarding SQL dialects:
  - Operators and functions can be defined on per-dialect basis. (@aljazerzen, #2681)
  - _Breaking_: The sql.duckdb target supports DuckDB 0.8 (@eitsupi, #2810).
  - _Breaking_: The sql.hive target is removed (@eitsupi, #2837).
  - New arithmetic operators.
    These compile to different function or operator depending on the target.
  - _Breaking:_ Operator / now always performs floating division (@aljazerzen, #2684). _TODO: add link to division operator docs_
  - Truncated integer division operator // (@aljazerzen, #2684).
  - Regex search operator ~= (@max-sixty, #2458).
    An example:
  - New aggregation functions: every, any, average, and concat_array.  _Breaking:_ Remove avg in favor of average.
  - _Breaking:_ We've changed our function declaration syntax to match other declarations.
    Functions were one of the first language constructs in PRQL, and since then we've added normal declarations there's no compelling reason for functions to be different.
  - Experimental modules, which allow importing declarations from other files.
    Docs are forthcoming.
  - Relation literals create a relation (a "table") as an _array_ of _tuples_.
    This example demonstrates the new syntax for arrays [] and tuples {}. (@aljazerzen, #2605)
  - this can be used to refer to the current pipeline, for situations where plain column name would be ambiguous:
  - _Breaking:_ functions count, rank and row_number now require an argument of the array to operate on.
    In most cases you can directly replace count with count this.
    The non_null argument of count has been removed.
  - We've changed how we handle colors.
  - prqlc can now show backtraces when the standard backtrace env var (RUST_BACKTRACE) is active. (@max-sixty, #2751)
  - Numbers expressed with scientific notation — 1e9 — are now handled correctly by the compiler (@max-sixty, #2865).
  - prql-python now provides type hints (@philpep, #2912)
  - Annotations in PRQL.
    These have limited support but are currently used to specify binding strengths.
    They're modeled after Rust's annotations, but with @ syntax, more similar to traditional decorators. (#2729)
  - Remove BigQuery's special handling of quoted identifiers, now that our module system handles its semantics (@max-sixty, #2609).
  - ClickHouse is tested in CI (@eitsupi, #2815).
  - @maxmcd, with #2533
  - @khoa165, with #2876
  - @philpep, with #2912
  - @not-my-profile, with #2971
