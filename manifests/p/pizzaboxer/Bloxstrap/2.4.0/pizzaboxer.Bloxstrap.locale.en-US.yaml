ReleaseNotes: |-
  New features
  - Added a full FastFlag editor.
    Yep, it took this long, but it's finally here, no more JSON editing!
  - Added context menu support for the notification area icon. (#186)
  - Added ability to view server details at any time, not just through a notification.
  - Added a new bootstrapper style mimicing the fake Byfron bootstrapper that fooled a lot of people.
    Okay, look, it was funnier back when it was still relevant :( (#169 - @1011025m)
  - Added support for game message communication.
    Just wait, I'll get around to writing docs for this. (#171)
  - [Mod] Added the option to configure the emoji set that Roblox uses. (#148)
  - [Mod] Added the option to use the pre-2013 style mouse cursor.
    If you had the old cursor option enabled, you'll have to reconfigure it.
  - [Mod] Added the option to use the old avatar editor background used prior to 2020 in the desktop app. (#353)
  - [Mod] Added the option to roughly emulate the old character sounds used prior to 2014.
  - [Mod] Added the ability to easily choose the font that Roblox uses.
    Comic sans galore.
  - [FastFlag] Added flags for fixing DPI scaling, which are automatically set.
  - [FastFlag] Added the option to use the new v4/2023 escape menu.
  - [FastFlag] Added the option to use ShadowMap/Phase 2 lighting. (#263)
  - [FastFlag] Added the option to use the old material textures used prior to 2022. (#215)
  - [FastFlag] Added the option to enable in-game GUI hiding. (#230#issuecomment-1542966228)
  Changes, fixes, and improvements
  - [FastFlag] Flag for Direct3D fullscreen is now applied automatically, no need to manually set it.
  - Extra help information is now shown throughout the menu
  - Dialog boxes now follow the style of Bloxstrap's main look.
  - Fixed weird looking titlebar in the menu on Windows 11.
    Similarly, the padding has been changed to look more like native windows.
  - Made the Fluent bootstrapper style more visually comforting, now more akin to the Vista style.
  - Fixed progress bar marquee not having rounded corners. (#96 - @bluepilledgreat)
  - More helpful details and information are now shown whenever an exception happens, instead of just throwing the error in your face.
  - Fixed user interface not showing on beta/leaked builds of Windows 11.
    Yes, I actually had to account for this. (#413)
  - Fixed bug with Bloxstrap not cleaning up the notification area icon after exit.
    Sorry about that. (#295)
  - Channel selector in the menu now checks if the channel you've chosen is out of date (behind LIVE).
    This replaces the startup check.
  - Pre-installation notice now shows as its own page, instead of just an easily dismissable dialog box.
  - Bloxstrap now checks to ensure the install location you've selected is not empty, extra cautious when uninstalling too. (#314)
  - The Bloxstrap installation folder is now fully cleaned up after uninstallation.
  - Approximate disk space that Bloxstrap consumes is now calculated and set in the installation manifest.
  - Improved handling of Roblox updates while Roblox is already running. (#253)
  - If the desktop app is disabled, it'll now be temporarily re-enabled when launching a deeplink.
  - Bloxstrap now assumes the channel to be LIVE if Roblox does not specify a channel from web launch.
  - Channel change prompt now only shows once during the enrollment period.
  - Channel change stuff has been moved to the Behaviour tab, it's the most suitable place for it.
  - Added notice for people using N editions of Windows without the necessary Windows Media libraries.
  - Fixed problems related to UAC when launching Roblox, auto-stripping executable flag to run as admin.
  - Fixed problems with old Roblox versions not being cleaned up correctly.
  - Improved handling of launching two or more instances simultaneously.
  - Mitigated problems with desktop icon creation (#410)
  - Only one instance of the Bloxstrap menu can now be launched.
  - Fixed problems related to system locale. (#268)
  - Better handling of malformed installation registry key. (#264)
  - Self-updating system has been changed to update based on file hash, not version.
  - Join server button on rich presence presence now no longer shows if in a private/reserved server.
  - Activity tracking is now shown as its own option, partly for the new context menu, and to make it clearer on how rich presence and other dependent features work.
  - Activity tracking no longer screws up if it detects a Roblox log file _from the future_.
    Because yes, that's a thing that can happen.
  Removals
  - [FastFlag] Removed the option to enable the v3/2021 escape menu, because it doesn't exist anymore. (#328)
  - [FastFlag] Removed the option to enable the mobile layout in the desktop app.
    Being honest here, it was only added as filler.
  - Oh, that's it?
