ReleaseNotes: |-
  - 32-bit builds of Bloxstrap have now been completely dropped. I think you can imagine why.
  - ReShade has now been removed, as it does not work with the new 64-bit game client. It's finally over.
  - If you have server details notifications enabled, you can now copy the server's job ID by clicking on the notification. (suggested by @vydf_)
  - You can now choose to ignore automatic channel changes completely. If you previously had this configured, you will have to reconfigure it. (#166)
  - Old log files are now automatically cleaned up. (suggested by @bluepilledgreat)
  - FastFlag management is now separated from the Mods tab, as it's grown big enough to become its own thing.
  - You can now choose to force Future or Voxel lighting technology in all games. (thanks @EasternBloxxer!)
  - The time playing stat on Discord Rich Presence now persists through server teleports within the same game.
  - Bloxstrap now has a notification area icon that shows whenever its running.
  - Fixed a bug with Discord Rich Presence not working with single letter game names.
  - Fixed a bug with Direct3D 11 incorrectly being enforced when choosing a rendering mode. (#162)
  - Free disk space is now checked depending on how much data needs to be downloaded. (suggested by @apprehensions)
  - Bloxstrap should no longer crash for some users when attempting to load the user interface. (#170, #173)
  - Oh yeah, this update features a logo refresh! (thanks again to Multako for helping me out)
