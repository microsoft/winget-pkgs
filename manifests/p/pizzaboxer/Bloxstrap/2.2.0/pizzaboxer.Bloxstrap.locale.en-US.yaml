ReleaseNotes: |-
  Important fixes:
  - Bloxstrap no longer trips Byfron and crashes Roblox after a minute of running (if you're on the 64-bit/Byfron channel).
  - If you're using ReShade, you'll now be forced to use the 32-bit Roblox channel.
    ReShade is on its last knees, but hopefully this extends its life by a few weeks.
  - rbxfpsunlocker has been removed altogether, being replaced in favour of a FastFlag mod preset.
   v2.2.0 feature updates:
  - In the menu's Appearance tab, Icon selection is automatically changed to 'Custom' when selecting a custom icon location. (#109)
  - In the menu's Installation tab, you can now enter any custom channel name. (#132)
  - More FastFlag mod presets have been added (Lua App mobile interface, showing full graphics slider, menu version selection)
  - Bloxstrap's behaviour when launching Roblox is now closer to the official Roblox bootstrapper.
