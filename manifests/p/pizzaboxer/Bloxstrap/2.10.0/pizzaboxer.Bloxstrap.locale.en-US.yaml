ReleaseNotes: |-
  This version of Bloxstrap is mostly just cutting down on features and options that now no longer work, due to some Roblox changes over the past few months.
  - The following options have been removed:
    - Multi-instance launching (roblox broke it)
    - Old death sound (roblox added it back)
  - The following Engine Settings presets have been removed:
    - Disable player shadows
    - Disable post-processing effects
    - Disable terrain textures
    - Disable full-screen titlebar
    - Enable ability to hide GUIs (you can leave the group if you wish)
    - Font size (can now be adjusted in-game)
    - Framerate limit (should use the in-game one)
    - Rendering mode (we didn't remove it properly in this update but it doesn't work)
  - The Fast Flag editor has now been removed for people using Roblox Player
  It's a lot, unfortunately. For some context, Roblox now whitelists what Fast Flags are allowed to be used by players (Devforum announcement). They've also been cracking down on multi-instance launching and now have preventative anti-measures for it.
  All of Bloxstrap's other features like modding and activity detection will continue to work. We'll also be adding some new presets in the future that Roblox has decided to allow for.
