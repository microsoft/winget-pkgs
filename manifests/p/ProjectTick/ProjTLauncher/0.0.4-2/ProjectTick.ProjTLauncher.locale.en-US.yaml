ReleaseNotes: |-
  We are excited to announce the official release of ProjT Launcher: version 0.0.4-2.
  This release is a structural consolidation and infrastructure refinement update following the 0.0.4-1 transition.
  It focuses on stabilizing versioning logic, modernizing CI workflows, unifying documentation under a single handbook, and improving project automation policies.
  User-facing behavior remains unchanged, while internal systems are now significantly cleaner, more deterministic, and easier to maintain.

  - Documentation and website alignment
    - Unified handbook generation across docs/ and website-root/handbook (#271)
    - Updated .eleventyignore to reflect the new handbook layout (#271)
  Fixed
  - Handbook and site build issues

    - Removed unused handbook.11tydata.js and corrected Eleventy ignore rules (#271)
  - Release consistency
    - Consolidated post-0.0.4-1 cleanup fixes to ensure metadata and version state correctness (#264, #265)

  Important Notes
  - This release intentionally focuses on internal consistency and long-term maintainability, not new end-user features.
  - Documentation is now single-source-of-truth, eliminating wiki drift and duplicated content.
  - CI workflows are aligned with the new versioning model and prepared for future automation.
  - No vendored third-party code was introduced; all external dependencies remain maintained forks.
