  Breaking changes
  Project renamed and moved
  The exporter has been renamed to windows_exporter, and moved to the prometheus-community organization (see #519).
  This includes changing the metrics' name prefixes from wmi_ to windows_, meaning that all queries need to be changed to match the new names.
  For example, windows_cpu_time_total replaces wmi_cpu_time_total.
  There are no functional changes in this release.
