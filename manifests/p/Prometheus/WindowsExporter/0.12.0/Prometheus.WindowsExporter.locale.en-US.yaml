ReleaseNotes: |-
  Deprecation note
  This is the last planned release with the wmi_exporter name, future releases will be named windows_exporter. See #499 and #519 for context.
  This also means that the next release will have a breaking change, the metrics will change names from wmi_... to windows_.... You will need to adjust your dashboards and alerts. See this comment for a suggestion if you want to rename metrics already now.
