ReleaseNotes: |-
  26.1.15
  - Fixed a regression where pressing Ctrl + Space to format a markdown table would show
    "An url was opened at the current cursor position" but no table formatting would happen
    (for #3454)
    - Table formatting with Ctrl + Space now works correctly again
    - The issue was caused by the fix for double-opening links in 26.1.14
  - Fixed an issue where Ctrl + Shift + Click on note links would not open notes in a new tab
    (for #3447)
    - When clicking a note link with Ctrl + Shift, the note now opens in a new tab as expected
    - Previously, if the note was already open in a tab, it would just switch to that existing tab
      instead of creating a new one
