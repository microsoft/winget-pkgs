ReleaseNotes: |-
  26.2.4
  - Added a "Copy note filename" menu action to copy the filename of the current note to the clipboard
    (for #3462)
    - This action is available in the note list context menu and in the status bar path label context menu
    - It copies just the filename (e.g., MyNote.md) instead of the full path
  - Added support for additional note link formats in the note relation graph and backlinks panel
    (for #3266)
    - Links using hyphens instead of underscores in note:// protocol are now recognized
      - Example: <note://Link-test2> now matches notes named "Link test2.md"
      - Previously only <note://Link_test2> was supported
    - Links with non-URL-encoded filenames with spaces are now recognized
      - Example: <Link test2.md> now works in addition to <Link%20test2.md>
    - Both markdown link syntax [text](link) and angle bracket syntax <link> are supported
    - Backlinks for those new links will display readable names in the navigation panel
  - Also fix hiding of the Command snippets in the settings dialog
    (for #3314)
  - Fixed an issue where enabling a panel in the Windows menu would not store the state
    immediately, causing the panel to be hidden again after an app restart
    (for #3463)
  - The AUR build is now done with cmake, aspell, libgit and system botan for improved build time
    and improved git and spellchecking support (for #3461)
