ReleaseNotes: |-
  25.7.7
  - Fixed a possible crash when locally diffing notes with enabled libgit2 support
    (for #3296)
  - In the Interface settings, there now is a setting to override the interface scale factor
    if you have scaling issues (for #3324)
    - Keep in mind that if you are disabling this setting and had it previously
      enabled, you need to restart the application manually so the previous environment
      variable that overrides the scale factor is not in your environment again
  - Added more Spanish, Finnish, Korean, French translation (thank you, alejandromoc, samlehtonen, venusgirl, jd-develop)
