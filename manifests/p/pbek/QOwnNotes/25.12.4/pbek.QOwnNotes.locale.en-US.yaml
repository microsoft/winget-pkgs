ReleaseNotes: |-
  25.12.4
  - Fixed an issue where external changes to recently edited notes were silently
    ignored instead of showing the diff dialog (for #3366)
    - When a note was edited within the last 60 seconds and then changed externally,
      small changes (≤8 characters difference) would be ignored without notification
    - The similarity check is now skipped for recently edited notes to ensure the
      diff dialog is always shown, preventing potential data loss
    - Notes that haven't been edited for a while continue to auto-reload silently
      for small external changes as intended
