ReleaseNotes: |-
  25.5.2
  - The OBS packages for Debian 12 and Debian Unstable are now built with cmake
    and Qt6, because CDBS doesn't support qmake after Debian 12 anymore
    (for #3267)
    - Please visit the Debian installation page
      for instructions and report issues
  - If you paste text as attachment, some file formats can now be detected if they
    match a certain pattern (for #3269)
  - Added more Korean translation (thank you, venusgirl)
