ReleaseNotes: |-
  25.6.0
  - QOwnNotes now builds with with Botan 3, when built with the system Botan library
    (cmake build parameter -DBUILD_WITH_SYSTEM_BOTAN=ON), because of the end of life of Botan 2
    (for #2786)
    - Keep in mind that Botan 3 needs C++20, which causes issues on Qt5
    - QMake and Qt5 will still use the internal Botan 2 amalgamation
    - Creating an amalgamation Botan 3 did work, but caused major issues with various build processes
  - The filename in checksum files of the Qt6 AppImages in the releases on GitHub was fixed
    (for #3286)
