ReleaseNotes: |-
  26.2.1
  - Added ability to rename headings directly in the Navigation panel
    (for #3459)
    - You can now double-click, press F2, or right-click and select "Rename heading"
      on any heading in the "Headings" tab of the Navigation panel to rename it
    - The heading text in your note will update automatically while preserving the heading level
    - When you rename a heading, QOwnNotes will scan all notes that link to the current note and prompt you to update any links that reference the old heading
    - This ensures that note links with heading fragments (e.g., [Link](note.md#old-heading)) remain valid after renaming
    - This provides a quick way to reorganize your note structure without manually editing the text or breaking backlinks
  - Added more French translation (thank you, baptistou)
