  25.6.4
  - Support for libgit2 was added to QOwnNotes, so it can be built with git support
    without the need for the git command line tool (for #3296)
    - This is an experimental feature and needs to be enabled with the CMake build
      parameter -DBUILD_WITH_LIBGIT2=ON
    - Keep in mind that you need to have the libgit2 development files installed
      on your system to build QOwnNotes with this feature
