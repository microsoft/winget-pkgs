ReleaseNotes: |-
  26.2.10
  - Fixed Nextcloud desktop client sync changes to non-current note files not being picked up by QOwnNotes
    (for #3468)
    - The Nextcloud client uses a temp-file + atomic rename strategy to update note files; the rename
      typically completes before the directoryChanged signal handler runs, so the temp file is already
      gone when QOwnNotes looks for it — the deferred re-index was therefore never triggered
    - The notes directory watcher now always schedules a deferred re-index (1 second after the directory
      change event) so the final on-disk state of all note files is captured regardless of whether a
      temp file is visible at the time the event fires
    - The note index rebuild also refreshes the note list when an existing note's content was updated
      on disk, not only when notes were added or removed
