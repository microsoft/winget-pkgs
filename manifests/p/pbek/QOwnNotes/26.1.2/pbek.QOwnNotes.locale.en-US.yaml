ReleaseNotes: |-
  26.1.2
  - Added Redo last action feature to quickly repeat the most recent action
    (for #3424)
    - Every action triggered from menus or toolbars is now automatically remembered
    - The "Redo action" menu item dynamically updates to show which action will be repeated
      (e.g., "Redo action: Insert text link")
    - Use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Alt+Shift+A or click the "Redo action" menu item to repeat the last action
    - The action is disabled initially and enabled after the first action is triggered
    - This allows for quick repetition of common actions without having to navigate back through menus
  - The Joplin Import Dialog now supports importing image tags with attributes
    (for #3419)
    - Image tags like <img width="640" height="364" src=":/imageId"/> are now properly recognized
    - Previously, only simple <img src=":/imageId"/> tags without attributes were supported
  - The Joplin Import Dialog now remembers the last selected directory
    - The directory path is automatically restored when reopening the dialog
    - The directory is only restored if it still exists on disk
  - The Evernote Import Dialog now remembers the last selected ENEX file
    - The file path is automatically restored when reopening the dialog
    - The file is only restored if it still exists on disk
  - Tried to fix an issue for some users where deleting notes with folders in a single
    operation when enabling the experimental note tree feature resulted in the deleted
    note still be shown in the note text edit (for #3374)
  - Added more Korean translation (thank you, venusgirl)
