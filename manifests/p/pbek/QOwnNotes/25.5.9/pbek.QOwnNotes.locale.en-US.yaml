ReleaseNotes: |-
  25.5.9
  - The packages on the Ubuntu repositories for Qt6 on Launchpad are now built with
    Qt6 and cmake, because of the dropped qmake support on Ubuntu 25.10+
    - See Install on Ubuntu
      for more information
    - This took a long time to complete, but scripting still doesn't seem to work
      in those packages
  - Added more Croatian, Spanish, Korean translation (thank you, milotype, alejandromoc, venusgirl)
