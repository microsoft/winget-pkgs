ReleaseNotes: |-
  25.10.0
  - There now is a new menu action and tray icon action to send the clipboard
    content via the QOwnNotes web application to another instance of QOwnNotes
    (for #3371)
    - You need to set the same security token in both instances to be able to
      send clipboard content
    - The tray action will also bring the app to focus, because it can happen that
      the app needs to get focus first before the correct clipboard content can be read
  - A tooltip for the tray icon was added
  - A crash on wayland was fixed when a global shortcut was set
