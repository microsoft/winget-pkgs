  25.12.5
  - Added ability to mark notes as favorite (for #351)
    - Right-click on a note and select "Mark as favorite" or "Unmark as favorite"
    - Favorite notes are displayed with a star icon in the note tree widget
    - Favorite notes are automatically positioned at the top of the note list
    - Favorite status is stored per note folder in local settings
    - The feature uses subfolder path and filename to identify notes (persistent across restarts)
    - Works with all sorting modes (alphabetical, by date)
    - Automatic migration: When a note is moved, renamed, or its headline changes
      (triggering auto-rename), favorite status is preserved
    - Automatic cleanup: When a note is deleted, it's removed from the favorites list
    - Periodic cleanup: Non-existent notes are automatically removed from favorites on note list refresh
