ReleaseNotes: |-
  26.2.7
  - The note list tooltip now shows the note file created date
    (for #841)
  - Added a search dialog to the QLiteHtml preview
    (for #3466)
    - The search dialog supports plain text, whole words, and regular expression search modes
    - Keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl+F to open, F3 for next/previous, Escape to close
  - The QLiteHtml preview now uses the editor background color from the color schema
    (for #3466)
  - The font size in the QLiteHtml preview is now aligned with the note text edit font size
    (for #3466)
    - Fixed an issue where fonts stored with pixel size would result in a smaller font size in the preview
    - The preview now properly uses the configured font size
  - Added support for copying selected text with Ctrl + C in the QLiteHtml preview
    (for #3466)
    - Both plain text and HTML (rich text) formats are copied to the clipboard
    - The copied HTML includes all formatting (colors, fonts, bold, italic, etc.) as inline styles
  - Improved text selection in the QLiteHtml preview (but it's still clunky)
    (for #3466)
    - Selection now only selects the specific text you click and drag over
    - Fixed an issue where entire paragraphs or blocks would be selected instead of precise text
