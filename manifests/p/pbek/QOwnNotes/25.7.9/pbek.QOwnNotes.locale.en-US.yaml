ReleaseNotes: |-
  25.7.9
  - When applying a formatter like bold, italic or underline to a text selection,
    a trailing paragraph separator will now be removed from the selection, so the
    formatting is applied to the line without the separator (for #3312)
  - More libraries were added to the Windows release of QOwnNotes to improve the
    compatibility with certain scripts from the script repository
    (for #3332)
