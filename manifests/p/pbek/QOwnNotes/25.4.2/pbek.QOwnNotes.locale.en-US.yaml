ReleaseNotes: |-
  25.4.2
  - Most of the initialization of the pages in the Settings dialog will now be
    done once when the page is shown, not when the settings dialog is created to
    speed up the opening of the dialog (for #3250)
  - The cloud connections test will now not be made automatically, when switching
    to the Nextcloud settings page, because that will store the settings,
    which takes a while (for #3250)
  - The maximum note save interval time was increased to 6 digits in the
    General settings (for #3254)
