ReleaseNotes: |-
  26.1.14
  - Fixed a regression where Ctrl + Click on links in the note editor caused them
    to be opened twice (for #3447)
    - Links are now opened only once when clicked with Ctrl
  - Added bookmark markers (1-9) next to line numbers in the note editor
    (for #3453)
    - When you store a note bookmark (Ctrl+1 through Ctrl+9), the bookmark slot number
      is now displayed in red next to the line number in the editor
    - Bookmark markers are only shown for the current note
    - The "Show line numbers" setting needs to be enabled in the editor settings
  - Fixed table border colors in dark mode preview to be white instead of black
    (for #3442)
    - Table borders are now properly visible in dark mode
    - Border colors automatically adapt based on the dark mode setting
