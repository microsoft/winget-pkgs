ReleaseNotes: |-
  26.1.1
  - Notes and note folders can now be deleted together in a single operation when enabling
    the experimental note tree feature (for #3374)
    - When both notes and folders are selected, they will all be deleted after confirmation
    - The context menu remove action adapts its text based on selection ("Remove notes", "Remove folders", or "Remove notes and folders")
    - The selection label now shows counts for both notes and folders when selected together (e.g., "5 note(s) and 2 folder(s) selected")
    - The confirmation dialog adapts to show what will be deleted (notes only, folders only, or both)
    - The current note is now properly reset after deletion to prevent deleted notes from remaining visible
    - This avoids having to delete notes and folders separately
  - The "Missing trigrams for languages" warning was changed to a debug message to reduce
    noise in the log output (for #3417)
    - This informational message now only appears when debug logging is enabled
    - The warning was triggered when regional language variants (e.g., it_CH) were installed
      but didn't have corresponding trigram models for automatic language detection
    - Spell checking functionality remains completely unaffected
  - Try to apply more snap deployment issues fixes (for #3416)
