ReleaseNotes: |-
  26.2.2
  - Improved the refactoring of heading links when renaming headings in the Navigation panel
    (for #3459)
    - Fixed an issue where heading backlink updates would incorrectly replace links to other notes with the same heading name
      - The backlink update now correctly matches the full link path, only updating links that point to the current note
      - Both URL-encoded and unencoded paths in links are now properly handled (e.g., My%20Note.md and My Note.md)
      - This prevents accidentally breaking links to other notes when renaming headings
    - Table of contents links within the same note (e.g., [Section](#old-heading)) are now also updated when renaming headings
      - This is useful for notes with TOC sections that link to headings within the note
      - Same-note links are properly detected and updated alongside backlinks from other notes
  - Added more Korean, Spanish translation (thank you, venusgirl, alejandromoc)
