  26.1.7
  - The Microsoft Visual C++ 2015–2022 x64 redistributable (vc_redist.x64.exe)
    will not not be bundled with the Windows release anymore to reduce the archive size
    (for #3431)
    - It was never documented that it was distributed together with QOwnNotes
  - For the Windows release, the language file structure was reorganized by moving
    .qm files from the root release directory into a dedicated language subdirectory
