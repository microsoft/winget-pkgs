ReleaseNotes: |-
  25.7.8
  - After a huge amount of work over many weeks, there now is a universal binary
    for macOS, built with Qt6 that works natively on Intel and Apple Silicon Macs
    (for #2912)
    - A big thank you to everyone involved
    - The universal binary is available in the releases on GitHub
      as QOwnNotes.dmg and is replacing the previous Intel Qt5 build
    - You need at least macOS 13 (Ventura) to run the new universal binary,
      the Qt5 legacy version will still be available as QOwnNotesQt5.dmg
    - A known issue with Qt6 on Intel Macs is that the application might crash on
      exit when the logging panel was turned on
    - Please visit the macOS installation page
      for more information
  - An issue with storing settings in the settings dialog would overwrite the toolbar
    settings in some circumstances was fixed (for #3318)
  - Added more Spanish, Thai, Korean translation (thank you, alejandromoc, tony.chompoo, venusgirl)
