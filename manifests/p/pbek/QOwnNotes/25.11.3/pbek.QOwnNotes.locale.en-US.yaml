ReleaseNotes: |-
  25.11.3
  - There now is an extra detection of external changes to note files while your
    changes to notes were not yet written to disk, to prevent overwriting external
    changes (for #3366)
    - This also works if you change multiple notes in a row and they are supposed
      to be stored to disk at a later time
    - Checksums are created for all notes to detect differences
    - A text diff dialog will be shown if such a change is detected
    - The text diff dialog will not be shown if ignoreAllExternalModifications
      is enabled, or the note diff dialog is shown (for the current note)
  - Fixed dependencies of .SRCINFO file being not consistent with those of
    PKGBUILD on the AUR (for #3392)
  - Added more Spanish, Korean, Chinese Simplified translation (thank you,
    alejandromoc, venusgirl, sr79368142)
