ReleaseNotes: |-
  26.2.9
  - Added experimental Markdown LSP support with settings for server command/arguments
    (for #3467)
    - The integration is experimental and currently provides completions via the autocomplete action
    - LSP info logs are no longer shown as warnings; only error-like stderr output is surfaced
    - Diagnostics published by the LSP server are now displayed as wave underlines in the editor;
      severity is reflected by color: red for errors, orange for warnings, blue for information,
      and green for hints
    - Hovering over a diagnostic underline shows a tooltip with the diagnostic message
    - Diagnostics are cleared automatically when switching to a different note
  - Fixed a vertical stripe flickering artifact in the QLiteHtml preview when dragging to select text
    (for #3466)
    - Degenerate zero- or negative-width selection highlight rects are now suppressed; these were
      generated when the cursor was at or near the start of a text element, causing a 1-pixel-wide
      highlight to be painted over the full height of the preview during mouse-drag selection
    - Mouse-move repaints now use a single full-viewport update instead of multiple partial dirty-rect
      updates, preventing intermediate frame artifacts during rapid selection drags
  - Improved text selection contrast in the QLiteHtml preview, especially in dark mode
    (for #3466)
    - Selected text now uses the palette highlight text color (QPalette::HighlightedText) instead of
      the original CSS text color, ensuring readable contrast over the selection highlight background
