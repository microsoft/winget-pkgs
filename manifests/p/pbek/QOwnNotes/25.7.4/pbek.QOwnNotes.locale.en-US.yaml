ReleaseNotes: |-
  25.7.4
  - With enabled libgit2 support, the amount of note versions gathered from the local
    git repository was limited to 100 to prevent performance issues with huge note folders
    and lots of git commits (for #3296)
  - The drawmode property assignment for the toolbars was removed to fix the warning
    QTabBar(0x3121e2c0, name="qt_tabwidget_tabbar") does not have a property named "drawbase"
    on newer Qt versions (for #3319)
