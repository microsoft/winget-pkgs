ReleaseNotes: |-
  25.12.0
  - Fixed PDF export from markdown preview now renders in color instead of grayscale
    (for #3399)
    - The printer color mode is now explicitly set to color when exporting notes as PDF
  - Added comprehensive protection against overwriting notes with empty or corrupted content
    (for #3400)
    - Notes with more than 100 bytes of content are now protected from being overwritten by empty files
    - Protection applies when loading notes from disk (updateNoteTextFromDisk)
    - Protection applies when creating notes from files (createFromFile)
    - Protection applies when writing notes to disk (storeNoteTextFileToDisk)
    - Protection applies when storing note text in memory (storeNewText)
    - Additional safeguards prevent loading files that have suspiciously shrunk by more than 90%
    - Warning messages are logged when protection is triggered to help with troubleshooting
    - This prevents data loss from file corruption, sync conflicts, external program errors, and accidental deletions
    - Small notes under 100 bytes can still be intentionally cleared without restrictions
