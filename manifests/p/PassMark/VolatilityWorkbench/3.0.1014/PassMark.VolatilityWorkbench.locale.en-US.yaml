ShortDescription: >
  Volatility Workbench is a graphical user interface (GUI) for the Volatility
  tool.
Description: |-
  Volatility is a command line memory analysis and forensics tool for extracting
  artifacts from memory dumps. Volatility Workbench is free, open source and runs
  in Windows. It provides a number of advantages over the command line version
  including,

  - No need to install Python script interpreter.
  - No need of remembering command line parameters.
  - Storage of the platform and process list with the memory dump, in a .CFG file.
    When a memory image is re-loaded, this saves a lot of time and eliminates the
    need to get process list each time.
  - Automatic platform detection with .CFG files
  - Simpler copy & paste.
  - Simpler printing of paper copies (via right click).
  - Simpler saving of the dumped information to a file on disk.
  - A drop down list of available commands and a short description of what the
    command does.
  - Time stamping of the commands executed.
  - Auto-loading the first dump file found in the current folder.
  - Support for analysing Mac and Linux memory dumps.
  - Up to 20% increase in speed compared to interpreted version.
