ShortDescription: >
  OSFClone is a free, self-booting solution which enables you to create or clone
  exact raw disk images quickly and independent of the installed operating
  system.
Description: |-
  In addition to raw disk images, OSFClone also supports imaging drives to the
  open Advance Forensics Format (AFF), AFF is an open and extensible format to
  store disk images and associated metadata, and Expert Witness Compression Format
  (EWF). An open standard enables investigators to quickly and efficiently use
  their preferred tools for drive analysis. After creating or cloning a disk
  image, you can mount the image with PassMark OSFMount before conducting analysis
  with PassMark OSForensics™.

  OSFClone creates a forensic image of a disk, preserving any unused sectors,
  slack space, file fragmentation and undeleted file records from the original
  hard disk. Boot into OSFClone and create disk clones of FAT, NTFS and
  USB-connected drives! OSFClone can be booted from CD/DVD drives, or from USB
  flash drives.

  OSFClone can create disk images in the dc3dd format. The dc3dd format is ideal
  for computer forensics due to its increased level of reporting for progress and
  errors, and ability to hash files on-the-fly.

  Verify that a disk clone is identical to the source drive, by using OSFClone to
  compare the MD5 or SHA1 hash between the clone and the source drive. After image
  creation, you can choose from a range of compression options to reduce the size
  of the newly created image, increasing portability and saving disk space.

  Use OSFClone to save forensic meta-data (such as case number, evidence number,
  examiner name, description and checksum) for cloned or created images.
