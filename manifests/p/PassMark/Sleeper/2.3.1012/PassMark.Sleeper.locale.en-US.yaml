ShortDescription: PC Sleep and Hibernation test tool
Description: |-
  Sleeper is a small utility program developed by PassMark Software to help test
  the ability of PC systems to enter and recover from sleep and hibernation. It
  has been designed to work with PassMark BurnInTest but will also work with 3rd
  party applications. Sleeper allows you to:

  - Put a PC into any sleep state (S1, S2, S3) supported by the system
  - Place your PC into hibernation (S4)
  - Wake the computer after a specified period of time.
  - Put a PC to sleep or hibernation from the command line
  - Force the PC into the requested sleep state
  - Cycle through all sleep states or just all states supported by the system
  - Launch Sleeper from BurnInTest scripts to test sleep states between test runs.
  - Display the supported sleep states
