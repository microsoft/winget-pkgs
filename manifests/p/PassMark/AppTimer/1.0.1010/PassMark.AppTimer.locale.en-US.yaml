ShortDescription: Application Startup Timer
Description: |-
  AppTimer will run an executable a number of times and time how long it takes for
  the application to reach a state where user input is being accepted before
  exiting the application.

  After each run of the application AppTimer will attempt to close the application
  in an automated fashion while logging the startup time measurements to a log
  file.

  It's main use is in benchmarking an application's startup time. This can be
  useful when comparing the performance of different products on the same
  hardware, or comparing the performance of the same product on different
  hardware.

  Using AppTimer will give far a more consistent and repeatable measurement than
  manual measurements with a stopwatch. Especially when the applications startup
  time is less than a couple of seconds.
