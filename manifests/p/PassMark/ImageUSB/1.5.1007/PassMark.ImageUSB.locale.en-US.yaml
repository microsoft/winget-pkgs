ShortDescription: >
  ImageUSB is a free utility which lets you write an image concurrently to
  multiple USB Flash Drives.
Description: |-
  Capable of creating exact bit-level copies of USB Flash Drive (UFDs), ImageUSB
  is an extremely effective tool for the mass duplication of UFDs. ImageUSB also
  supports writing of an ISO file byte by byte directly to an USB drive (*).
  ImageUSB can also be used to install OSFClone to a USB Drive for use with
  PassMark OSForensics™.

  Unlike other USB duplication tools, ImageUSB can preserve all unused and slack
  space during the cloning process, including the Master Boot Record (MBR).
  ImageUSB can perform flawless mass duplications of all UFD images, including
  bootable UFDs.

  imageUSB includes functionality to Zero a USB Flash Drive. This will replace the
  contents of the entire drive with 0s. Or alternatively to just Zero the MBR
  and/or GPT entries that exists on the drive. In addition, imageUSB has the
  ability to reformat even hard to format drives and reclaim any disk space that
  may be lost previously.

  (*) CD ISO images use a different file systems compared to USB drives. So the
  direct imaging of ISO9660, Joliet or UDF file system, from a CD, to a USB drive,
  might not allow the USB drive to function in all operating systems. A reformat
  can recover the drive however. As of V1.5, imageUSB now supports extraction of
  ISO contents onto USB Drive.

  Warning: Due to the forensic nature of image duplication by ImageUSB, please
  ensure that you select UFDs with a storage size similar to the image you wish
  to duplicate. For example, if a 2GB image is copied to an 8GB USB Flash Drive,
  the drive will only be able to use two out of the eight gigabytes of storage
  space. In this scenario, users will need to reformat the UFD in order to
  access the rest of the storage space.
