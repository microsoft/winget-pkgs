ReleaseNotes: |-
  1. Much quicker loading when downloading an app
  Previously when trying to download an app, there was a slight freeze of the UI before the download page is loaded. This was because it was checking whether the core modules have been already installed or not every time the download page loaded. This is unnecessary and just making the UX bad, so now it instead checks the core modules at launch, and the download page will load instantly.

  AFTER

  2. PINOKIO_SHARE_LOCAL_PORT
  The Local Network Sharing feature is great but by default the local share proxy servers are started at random ports. Sometimes you may want to fix these ports instead of dynamically generated.
  Now you can do this by setting the PINOKIO_SHARE_LOCAL_PORT environment variable inside each app's "Configure" page.
  3. Delete apps from home
  Now you can delete apps from Pinokio home with just a click of a button.

  4. Blue Screen
  Previously when something went wrong on Pinokio it would just freeze with a blank white screen, with no way of understanding what's gone wrong. Now when something goes wrong, Pinokio will displays a "blue screen", displaying the error messages.
  5. ENVIRONMENT Inheritance
  Now when you set a custom environment variable in the ~/pinokio/ENVIRONMENT file, whenever a new app is installed, the generated ENVIRONMENT file will inherit from the custom attributes in ~/pinokio/ENVIRONMENT.
  For example, if you set PINOKIO_SHARE_CLOUDFLARE to true globally through ~/pinokio/ENVIRONMENT, every app folder will automatically inherit this value true (by default it's false)
  6. Various Bug Fixes
  Some people experienced a blank white screen when upgrading to the last version. Have fixed a couple of issues which probably has fixed this.
  7. Port 80 or 42000
  Prior to Pinokio 2.0, the default port used by Pinokio has been 42000. With 2.0 this has changed to port 80 (in order to make the URL shorter when using Pinokio in zero-click launch mode inside regular browsers).
  However, some people run web servers on their machine (which use port 80), and this caused problems for these users. So with this release, Pinokio tries to use port 80 but if it's already occupied, it uses port 42000.
  This should get rid of all the issues related to the port (This was another reason some people were experiencing the "blank white screen" crash)
