ReleaseNotes: |-
  What's new
  1. Mac conda environment fix
  2. Mac xcode command line tools install fix
  3. Windows visual studio build tools install fix
  4. Linux build tools support (GXX via conda)
  5. Linux CUDA + G++ compatibility support (via an environment variable)
  6. More robust port availability checking logic.
  1. Mac Conda Environment Fix
  Set
  CONDA_ENVS_PATH: ~/pinokio/bin/miniconda/envs
  CONDA_PKGS_DIRS: ~/pinokio/bin/miniconda/pkgs
  2. Mac xcode command line tools install fix
  - just because xocde-select -p returns a path doesn't mean it's installed.
  - to properly check the install state, must run ls -m $(xcode-select -p) to see if it returns Library, SDKs, and usr
  3. Windows Visual Studio Refactor
  1. Handle cases where there are already multiple visual studio instances installed
  2. Handle cases where there are corrupt or paused installations of visual studio (build tools)
  3. Display a warning that if you get in an install loop, the best solution is to just open visual studio installer and uninstall broken installs
  4. Linux CUDA & G++ Compatibility Fix
  By default NVCC for CUDA121 requires G++ no greater than 12. But globally installed G++ may have higher versions and it would result in failure
  5. More robust available port checking
  is_port_running(port): To take into account ALL possible cases, instead of trying to create sockets to a url with a port, just simulate starting a server at the port, and if there's an exception, then it means the port doesn't work.
