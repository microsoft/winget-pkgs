ShortDescription: AI Browser
Description: Pinokio is a browser that lets you install, run, and programmatically control ANY application, automatically.
ReleaseNotes: |-
  Linux install issue fix
  Because on linux installing playwright with --install-deps flag requires root access, the initial requirement setup step fails for every linux user.
  So just don't do it for now. Only install playwright itself and the browsers.
  The dependencies can be installed manually only if needed (by the users).
  Now Playwright is installed under ~/pinokio/bin/playwright/node_modules, and the browsers are stored at ~/pinokio/bin/playwright/browsers
