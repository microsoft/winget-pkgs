ReleaseNotes: |-
  Visual Studio Build Tools Hotfix
  Previous fix from 3.3.25 neglected the scenario where the user doesn't have visual studio build tools installed (which will be true for most new--non developer--users just installing pinokio).
  Because i couldn't uninstall and reinstall visual studio every time i test the new version, neglected to check this scenario. But just replicated this by actually uninstalling build tools and starting from scratch.
  The problem has been fixed now. New users should not have any issue getting started
