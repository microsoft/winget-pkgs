ReleaseNotes: |-

  false


  - The fend CLI now uses native-tls by default, instead of rustls. On Windows this uses SChannel (via the schannel crate), on macOS it uses Secure Transport via the security-framework crate, and on Linux it links to OpenSSL with the openssl crate. You can continue using rustls by compiling with the --no-default-features --features rustls flags. See the CLI's Cargo.toml for further details.
