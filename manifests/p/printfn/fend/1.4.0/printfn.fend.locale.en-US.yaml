ShortDescription: Arbitrary-precision unit-aware calculator
ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Change unit simplification and unit aliasing to be simpler and more consistent. Units like `%` and `million` are now simplified unless you explicitly convert your result to one of those units. fend will now also simplify certain combinations of units, such as `volts / ohms` becoming `amperes`.

    For example:
    ```
    > 5%
    0.05
    > 46 million
    46000000
    > 0.5 to %
    50%
    > 34820000 to million
    34.82 million
    > (5 volts) / (2 ohms)
    2.5 amperes
    > 3 feet * 125 kg * s^-2
    114.3 newtons
    > c / (145MHz)
    approx. 2.0675341931 meters
    ```
  - Rename Windows installer artifacts (MSI files) to also include the version number, e.g. `fend-1.4.0-windows-x64.msi`.
  - Replace `nanorand` dependency with `rand`, which is better supported and fixes compilation errors on FreeBSD.
