  Editor
    Make editor flip, rotate, and scale tools revolve around the grid center (#26311 by @OliBomby)
    Changes how the Ctrl+H and Ctrl+J flip mechanic works. It now takes into account the origin and rotation of the grid to flip around that axis. This makes it easy to map symmetric patterns which are off-angle or not around the center of the playfield.

    Also the Ctrl+R rotation tool uses the grid origin as the center of the playfield.
    The precision scale tool uses the grid origin as the center of the playfield and uses the grid rotation for axis constrained scaling (for scaling only along the X or Y axis)

    Fix scaling sliders ignoring the scale origin (#29942 by @minetoblend)
    Makes sure that when scaling sliders with the scale box, they are scaled relatively to the scale origin instead of the slider head.

    Freeze select box buttons position on press (#29950 by @minetoblend)
    Will freeze the position of the SelectBox buttons in place when one of the buttons was clicked until the clicked button is no longer hovered. This ensures that buttons can be pressed repeatedly without having to reposition the mouse on every click.

    Especially when rotating the selection by 90 degrees, the buttons moving around on each press was a major pain point for me since I often wanna rotate by 180 degrees and just wanna double click the button for that.

    Support scaling around center when scaling with select box (#29949 by @minetoblend)
    Will scale around the center when pressing alt while scaling things with the select box.

    Add to existing selection when dragging with control pressed (#29918 by @bdach)

    Add button to centre editor grid to current hit object (#30069 by @peppy)

    Add hotkey hints to editor menus (#29691 by @bdach)

    Redesign editor setup screen with new "form" controls (#30099 by @bdach)
    Also contains some assorted drive-by fixes. See commit messages for details.

    Move setup screen background preview to appropriate form control (#30109 by @bdach)

    When adding a new combo colour, use the last colour as a starting point (#30110 by @peppy)
    Also opens the popover automatically because you always want to edit it.

    Smaller changes

      Fix occasional crash when changing samples of hitobjects (#29933 by @bdach)
      Refactor placement blueprints to not be limited to hit objects (#29986 by @OliBomby)
      This makes it possible to make placement tools which add something other than a hit object.
      Fix argon volume-aware hitsounds not correctly playing immediately after object placement (#29970 by @bdach)
      Use minimum enclosing circle as selection centre for scale and rotate (#29938 by @OliBomby)
      Ensure selection is preserved when moving selected objects between osu!mania columns (#29899 by @bdach)

      Only allow seek to next/previous object via keybinding if there is no selection (#29860 by @bdach)
      Fixes a key bind conflict.
      Fix "Center on selected object" button not changing grid coordinates (#30134 by @bdach)
      Add grid placement tool (#26313 by @OliBomby)
