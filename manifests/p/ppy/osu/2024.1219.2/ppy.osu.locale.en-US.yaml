ReleaseNotes: "Christmas!\nAdd Christmas festivities (ppy/osu-resources#350 by @peppy)\nOne Christmas at a time, we will make lazer the festive paradise it deserves to be.Special thanks to nekodex for the new track and pishifat for helping make the beatmap that fuels the lighting system. Also to everyone else who gave feedback along the way.Code Quality\n- Update game packages (ppy/osu-server-spectator#250 by @bdach)\n- Allow tsunyoku and stanriders to trigger diffcalc spreadsheet generator (ppy/osu#31071 by @smoogipoo)\n- Fix potential issues with medal display (ppy/osu#30877 by @peppy)\n    - Intends to address rare instances of medal display \"soft-locking\" the game.\n- Access beatmap store via abstract base class (ppy/osu#31076 by @peppy)\n- Attempt to fix flaky editor beatmap creation test (ppy/osu#31107 by @bdach)\n- Update localisations (ppy/osu-resources#349 by @peppy)\n- Fix BindableList methods crashing with non-IList collections (ppy/osu-framework#6466 by @smoogipoo)\nEditor\nImplement basic bookmark support in editor (ppy/osu#30960 by @bdach)\nFront-loaded as \"basic\" support because:\n- Bookmarks only display on bottom timeline. I thought a bit about having them show on the top timeline too, but I'm not sure I can fit it in there and not make the timeline even more oversaturated with info than it already is.\n- Hotkeys from stable work, with slight alterations:\n- Ctrl-B to add a bookmark\n- Ctrl-Shift-B to remove the closest bookmarks (all within 2s of current timestamp)\n- Alt-← to seek to previous bookmark\n- Alt-→ to seek to next bookmark\n- The only exposed way to mutate the bookmarks from the UI that is not the hotkey is in the timing menu. That's different from stable where there are bookmark controls near the bottom timeline, but again, not sure how to make that happen without cluttering things further.\nAllow choosing different background/audio files for individual difficulties (ppy/osu#30860 by @frenzibyte)\nSmaller changes\n- Preserve effect point specifications when creating blank difficulties (ppy/osu#30973 by @frenzibyte)\n    - Fixes kiai time and scroll speed specifications being lost when creating a new difficulty.
