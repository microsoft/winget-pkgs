ReleaseNotes: |
  Christmas!
    Add Christmas festivities (ppy/osu-resources#350 by @peppy)
    One Christmas at a time, we will make lazer the festive paradise it deserves to be.Special thanks to nekodex for the new track and pishifat for helping make the beatmap that fuels the lighting system. Also to everyone else who gave feedback along the way.
  Code Quality
    - Update game packages (ppy/osu-server-spectator#250 by @bdach)
    - Allow tsunyoku and stanriders to trigger diffcalc spreadsheet generator (ppy/osu#31071 by @smoogipoo)
    - Fix potential issues with medal display (ppy/osu#30877 by @peppy)
    - Intends to address rare instances of medal display "soft-locking" the game.
    - Access beatmap store via abstract base class (ppy/osu#31076 by @peppy)
    - Attempt to fix flaky editor beatmap creation test (ppy/osu#31107 by @bdach)
    - Update localisations (ppy/osu-resources#349 by @peppy)
    - Fix BindableList methods crashing with non-IList collections (ppy/osu-framework#6466 by @smoogipoo)
  Editor
    Implement basic bookmark support in editor (ppy/osu#30960 by @bdach)
    Front-loaded as "basic" support because:
    - Bookmarks only display on bottom timeline. I thought a bit about having them show on the top timeline too, but I'm not sure I can fit it in there and not make the timeline even more oversaturated with info than it already is.
    - Hotkeys from stable work, with slight alterations:
      - Ctrl-B to add a bookmark
      - Ctrl-Shift-B to remove the closest bookmarks (all within 2s of current timestamp)
      - Alt-← to seek to previous bookmark
      - Alt-→ to seek to next bookmark
    - The only exposed way to mutate the bookmarks from the UI that is not the hotkey is in the timing menu. That's different from stable where there are bookmark controls near the bottom timeline, but again, not sure how to make that happen without cluttering things further.
    Allow choosing different background/audio files for individual difficulties (ppy/osu#30860 by @frenzibyte)
  Smaller changes
    - Preserve effect point specifications when creating blank difficulties (ppy/osu#30973 by @frenzibyte)
    - Fixes kiai time and scroll speed specifications being lost when creating a new difficulty. Scroll speed specifications are only retained when creating a new difficulty for the same ruleset as the original beatmap.
    - Fix adjusting control point offset after undo/redo causing catastrophic failure (ppy/osu#31109 by @peppy)
    - Change the way "current" points are hinted on timing screen (ppy/osu#31110 by @peppy)
  Gameplay
    - Fix player settings overlay cog overlapping skin elements (ppy/osu#31106 by @peppy)
    - This brings it down to be in line with the flowing elements that usually do their best to not get in the way.
    Gameplay (osu!)
      - Use time-based resume overlay when playing osu! on touchscreen (ppy/osu#31156 by @frenzibyte)
      - The "click to resume" overlay does not work on touchscreen devices as the idea is to point with a pointer and press a key / mouse button to resume.
    Gameplay (osu!catch)
      Add convert to stream functionality for juice streams (ppy/osu#30763 by @Darius-Wattimena)
    Gameplay (osu!taiko)
      - Update recommended difficulty for osu!taiko (ppy/osu#31103 by @Joehuu)
      - Implement considerations for Relax within osu!taiko diffcalc (ppy/osu#30591 by @Lawtrohux)
      - Adjust DifficultyValue curve to avoid lower star rating of osu!taiko being too inflated (ppy/osu#31067 by @YaniFR)
    Multiplayer
      Improve multiplayer room status handling (ppy/osu#30838 by @smoogipoo)
      Thanks to this change, you can now see whether players in a multiplayer room are currently playing a map or not on the listing.
      Add ability to filter out currently playing rooms (ppy/osu#31073 by @bdach)
    Performance
      Fix increased CPU usage when game is in the background (ppy/osu-framework#6451 by @smoogipoo)
    Smaller changes
      - Avoid beatmap lookup per bar in logo visualisation (ppy/osu#31047 by @peppy)
      - Improve BindableList performance + reduce allocations (ppy/osu-framework#6450 by @smoogipoo)
  Platform
    Enable beatmap exports on iOS (ppy/osu#31037 by @frenzibyte)
    Bump OpenTabletDriver to 0.6.5.0 (ppy/osu-framework#6465 by @jamesbt365)
    Pulls in detection & support improvements for tens of tablet models.Smaller changes
    - Fix IPC not working in release (ppy/osu#31000 by @LittleEndu)
    - Prefer HDTV / Rec. 709 colorspace for videos with HD resolution and unspecified colorspace (ppy/osu-framework#6403 by @frenzibyte)
    - Fix unobserved exceptions on named pipe shutdown (ppy/osu-framework#6447 by @peppy)
    - Add descriptions to osu! file associations in iOS (ppy/osu#31035 by @frenzibyte)
    - Add support for presenting/opening files on iOS (ppy/osu-framework#6448 by @frenzibyte)
    - Use temporary storage for file exports on iOS (ppy/osu#31039 by @frenzibyte)
    - Fix multiple instances of a game being allowed to start concurrently (ppy/osu-framework#6452 by @peppy)
    - Bring back iOS application delegates and fix many issues (ppy/osu-framework#6453 by @frenzibyte)
    - Fix iOS audio session allowing other background audio to mix with game audio (ppy/osu-framework#6457 by @frenzibyte)
    - Fix disabling hold-to-right-click not cancelling in-progress actions (ppy/osu-framework#6459 by @frenzibyte)
    - Affects mobile devices. Noticed in osu! gameplay, where if you press resume from the pause overlay, a right click is always triggered at the point where the button was clicked:
    - Fix iOS app configuration missing certain specifications (ppy/osu#31162 by @frenzibyte)
    - Fixes some iOS submission guideline failures.
  Results
    Allow using "quick retry" shortcut in more cases from results screen (ppy/osu#31108 by @peppy)
    Fixes "quick retry" hotkey not working for autoplay, but also allows using it for other replays when the replay is already guaranteed to be local (ie. on the second playback).Skin Editor
    Fix player settings overlay appearing while in skin editor (ppy/osu#31105 by @peppy)
    Also stops the settings appearing if the mouse is too far away from the window.Skinning
    - Fix lookups of hit circle slider pieces potentially using wrong source skin (ppy/osu#31052 by @peppy)
    - Visible on some maps with partial beatmap skins included:
    Add recommended difficulty numerical value near filter in beatmap listing (ppy/osu#31101 by @Joehuu)

    - Fixes total score displaying completely wrong and mangled values on languages that use spaces as thousands separators.
    - Expose high precision mouse toggle when searching for "sensitivity" and other keywords (ppy/osu#31139 by @peppy)
