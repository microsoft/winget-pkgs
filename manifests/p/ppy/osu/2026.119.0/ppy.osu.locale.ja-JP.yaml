  ✓ Ensure global leaderboard state matches beatmap when loading player (osu#33878)by spaceman_atlas
  ✓ Fix beatmap skin sample lookups falling back to non-custom sample banks if the custom bank sample was not found (osu#33908)by spaceman_atlas

  # Skin Editor
  ✓ Fix rotating objects in the skin editor not rotating as expected (osu#33856)by peppy
  + Add ability to edit skin externally from skin editor (osu#30226)by smallketchup82
    Similarly to the analogous option in beatmap editor, this allows arbitrary external modifications to skins. In particular this means that it is now possible to change gameplay assets without exporting and re-emporting the skin.
  ✓ Fix skins containing subdirectories breaking on external edit on windows (osu#33999)by spaceman_atlas
    For anyone who broke their skins because of this, this change also allows them to be retroactively fixed by starting an external edit operation and immediately finishing it (you don't need to make any changes to the skin files).
  # Skinning
  + Add support for rank change sound effects in legacy skins (osu#33657)by nekodex
  ✓ Allow changing weight in TextElement and similar skin elements (osu#33888)by frenzibyte

  # Song Select
  ✓ Calculate PP in leaderboard tooltips if missing (osu#33545)by nobbele
  ✓ Fix touch mod not being set correctly (osu#33564)by tsunyoku
  ✓ Fix unnecessary GPU overhead on carousel scroll (osu#33570)by EVAST
  ✓ Adjust max sizing at song select slightly (osu#33577)by peppy
    The carousel will now take up more screen real estate on very-widescreen resolutions.
  ✓ Remove logo scale when mod select appears (osu#33597)by peppy
    Having it scale was causing quick user interactions to fail.
  ✓ Remove shear on update button to match non-sheared panel design (osu#33605)by peppy
  ✓ Show full mod details in footer mod icons (osu#33607)by peppy
  ✓ Allow changing difficulties using up and down arrows when sets are grouped (osu#33598)by peppy
  ✓ Fix scrollbar getting hidden underneath the osu! logo (osu#33628)by peppy
  ✓ Fix clicking in the bottom-left corner not always going back (osu#33632)by peppy
    Due to popular demand, you can now click outside of the visible back button region and still arrive back at the main menu.
  ✓ Fix leaderboard scores not visually updating correctly after resolution change (osu#33638)by frenzibyte
  + Add ability to reveal background when long pressing in empty space (osu#33629)by peppy
  ✓ Fix skin layer not hiding when revealing background (osu#33734)by peppy
  ✓ Adjust rank formatting logic to avoid getting cut in score (osu#33753)by frenzibyte
  + Add support for traversing and toggling expanded state of song select groups (osu#33668)by peppy
    This adds back some keys which users have learned to depend on (and I have forgotten ever existed).
    - Shift + Left / Right now allows traversing between groups
    - Shift + Enter now toggles the expanded state for the current group
    This also changes the behaviour such that when you open a group which contains the currently selected beatmap, keyboard selection (and scroll target) will be transferred to it.
  ✓ Fix incompatible mods not retaining settings after selecting autoplay via ctrl+enter (osu#33765)by frenzibyte
  ✓ Fix pressing multiple traversal keys in same frame causing weirdness (osu#33775)by peppy
  + Add more localisation support back (osu#33787)by diquoks
  ✓ Restrict random selection to currently open group (osu#33773)by peppy
    This also make random button work well with difficulty grouping mode for the first time.
  ✓ Improve random button sound effects (osu#33957)by peppy
    - Now plays an error sound if random / rewind fails, to better inform the user of what happened.
    - Adjusts the "swoosh" pitch to work more closely to how it did at v1 song select.
    - Fixes regression causing sound to not play when it should.
  ✓ Fix Difficulty Adjust extended mod icon information not showing with extended limits active (osu#33962)by spaceman_atlas
  ✓ Use floored star rating when determining beatmap groupings by difficulty and when star rating is displayed in AdvancedStats (osu#33968)by chris-ehmann
  ✓ Change audio ducking at song select v2 to be temporary to avoid conflict with overlays (osu#33971)by peppy
  ✓ Fix footer appearing at loader screen on quick retries (osu#33973)by peppy
  ✓ Make Song Select v2 the new default (osu#33970)by peppy
    Note that it is still not used in multiplayer and playlists. This will be the final step required to remove the old version from the code base.
  + Add back background blur support back (osu#33997)by peppy
  ✓ Adjust score tooltip design slightly (osu#33998)by frenzibyte
  ✓ Adjust carousel sizing to better accommodate to ultra-wide-screen display (osu#34013)by peppy

  + Add mode for grouping beatmaps by their source (osu#33889)by frenzibyte
  ✓ Disallow hiding beatmap difficulties if only one difficulty remains (osu#34088)by peppy
  ✓ Improve song select's automatic selection behaviour when current selection is no longer valid (osu#34087)by peppy
  # UI
  ✓ Visual pass on loading spinner (osu#33723)by peppy
    Slightly adjusted animations and transparency levels.
  ✓ Adjust some button's hover colours to improve visual contrast with text (osu#33754)by peppy
  ✓ Remove fade from footer display transition (osu#33664)by peppy
  ✓ Fix dropdown search bar not having placeholder text (osu#33852)by frenzibyte
  ✓ Fix inconsistent rounding strategy for PP (osu#33830)by EYHN
  + Add missing Chinese character ranges characters (osu-resources#368)by frenzibyte
  + Add menu tip exposing song select right click scroll behaviour (osu#33979)by peppy

  + Add custom keybinds support to tips in Main menu (osu#33863)by diquoks
  ✓ Update flag assets (osu-resources#372)by spaceman_atlas
