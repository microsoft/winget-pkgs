  Editor
  Fix changing slider path segment type not being undoable (ppy/osu#26423 by @B3nn1)
  Add precise scaling control to osu! editor (ppy/osu#28309 by @OliBomby)
  This adds the scale popover tool from osu!stable to lazer. I tried to mimic the original functionality as closely as possible, and in some aspects improve it.The default hotkey for the scaling tool which is Ctrl+E (to avoid conflicts with the skin layout editor).The maximum value of the scale slider is determined based on the current choice of origin and axis. The maximum value will always be the maximum scaling value that still keeps the scaling objects on screen.This also slightly changes how the rotation popover works. Now it will automatically select the text in the textbox input, so the user can instantly type the value they want after opening the tool.osu Game Rulesets Osu Tests_EcLev87sNtFix legacy osu!mania note body animation not resetting sometimes (ppy/osu#28339 by @bdach)

  Add support for editing per-node hitsounds on sliders (ppy/osu#23443 by @OliBomby)
  osu Game Rulesets Osu Tests_y2uv5bNj0BDisplay breaks on editor timeline & allow manually adjusting their duration (ppy/osu#28523 by @bdach)
  Add automatic generation of breaks in editor (ppy/osu#28528 by @bdach)
  Breaks are automatically inserted between objects if there is ample time to do so, namely there must be at least:- 200ms between the last object before break and the break's start
  - 650ms for the break itself
  - 2 beat lengths between the break's end and the first object after break. This is a departure from stable wherein this was ruleset- and AR-dependent (by way of using preempt time), but in talking with the NAT it looked like most didn't know the specifics of how that worked so I decided I'd just use something simpler. This also probably works better for something like mania wherein the "preempt time" is largely user-settings-dependent (scroll speed).
  Breaks that have been manually adjusted are not moved by the automatic regeneration on changes, unless they would break gameplay (by having an object's duration intersect a break), in which case they are forcibly removed. This manual adjustment tracking state is dodgy at best (will not work properly with undo/redo, because this info is not and should not be serialised out by the legacy beatmap encoder, which means that the manual tracking will be dropped upon undo), but it is what it is. That subsystem needs to get replaced by something else at some point anyway.Fix osu!taiko playfield not updating after changing scroll speed (ppy/osu#28444 by @bdach)
