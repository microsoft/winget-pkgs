ReleaseNotes: |-
  New features
  - Support for PicoScope 3000E MSO devices.
  - AuxIO on 6000E and 3000E scopes now provides a trigger output signal when not in use as an input.
  - Code optimization and core technology enhancements have improved speed and responsiveness of the software in several areas.
  - The connected device's maximum bandwidth and sample rate is now displayed within the application title bar.
  - Command-line batch conversion of psdata files to CSV, Text, or Matlab file format for Mac and Linux.
  - Mac Sonoma support for drivers: ps6000a, ps5000a.
  - The Mono framework is no longer required for PS7 installation (Mac & Linux).
  - Updates to translations in all languages.
  - Filters update live when editing Serial decoding or DeepMeasure filters.
  - Added Bit order (MSB/LSB) to Extended UART decoder.
  - Serial decoding now supports a new "Index of" operator to select a specific section of data from a column
  - Various improvements to demo mode, providing a better experience and allowing access to some of the wider capabilties of the PicoScope 7 software, including MSO channels and the Signal Generator / AWG, as well as offering a selection of different test signals to choose from.
  - Added new maths functions for; RMS (DC coupled), Cycle time, High/Low pulse width, Rise/Fall time and Rising/Falling rate.
  - Maths wizard information button added, linking to more maths function information within the online knowledge base articles.
  - Tracking Rulers are now available within the Rulers options panel. Enabling these will automatically read the channel trace value at the rulers' time/frequency positions.
  - Enable / Disable each channel's rulers independently from the the rulers options panel.
  - Ruler delta values now shows greater precision when zoomed in.
  - Trigger type icons in the options panel now update with the trigger direction, for easier visualization of trigger settings.
  - Channel options panels now feature a colored bar for easier identification of the channel being controlled.
  - Control added to the MSO options panels to enable or disable all digital channels at once.
  - The TA167 200/2000A current probe has been added to the built-in software probe list.
  - Increased max input range to 10V for TA398 BNC+ coil-on-plug and signal probe.
  - Keyboard shortcuts user-interface improvements.
  - A new settings option to choose for the options panel to open over the scope trace, rather than pushing the trace to the side.
  - Horizontal zoom can now be controlled using the mouse wheel or trackpad scroll.

  Bug fixes
  - The Connect Device dialog now automatically updates when a new device is connected. (Linux only)
  - Updated Linux packages to resolve a dependency error installing on non-LTS Ubuntu 24.10. Note PicoScope is only fully tested and supported on LTS releases.
  - Graph data is now correctly cleared if no waveforms have been captured in the buffer.
  - Fixed issue where driver information was incorrect in the About dialog for certain devices (Mac and Linux).
  - Various fixes and improvements to stability.
  - Fixed a couple of issues when trying to use masks when using Spectrum mode.
  - Rising rate Measurements stability improvement.
  - Crest factor maths function now gives a suitable automatic range.
  - Frequency Math channel function validation fix.
  - Spaces removed from the Serial Decoding table to reduce confusion for filtering.
  - Fixed channel trace color preference not being saved if set to white.
  - Fixed issues with channel invert not applying to math channels, when zooming in with filtering applied, when using sin(x)/x interpolation or when saving reference waveforms.
  - When appropriate, PicoConnect and BNC+ probes now keep any applied software probe after loading a file.
  - Zero Offset functionality reinstated for PicoConnect D9 probes for PicoScope 4444, including TA300, TA301 and TA368.
  - Fixed crash generating a mask on timebases slower than a minute across the screen.
  - Fixed an issue where Rulers were not visible when exporting images in dark theme.
  - Fixed issue where "%20" replaces spaces in a folder path in the save Dialog.
  - Fixed an issue where Matlab files would sometimes fail to export correctly.
  - Several fixes to the graph drawing for print and copy as image.
  - Fixed occasional missed triggers at very slow timebases with PicoScope 3000E.
  - ps6000a : The max trigger cycles should be uint32_t max value.
  - ps3000a: Fixed external trigger direction not correctly behaving with above/below triggers.
