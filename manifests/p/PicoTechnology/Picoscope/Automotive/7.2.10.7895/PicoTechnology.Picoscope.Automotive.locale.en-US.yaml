ReleaseNotes: |-
  New features
  - NOTE: From this version, PS7 will no longer install on MS Windows 7, 8, 8.1 and the earliest release versions of 10.
  - A new Channel Deskew control has been integrated into the Channel Display tabs.
  - A new Waveform Overlay tool allows multiple scope or spectrum traces to be overlaid using controls in the Waveform Navigator, enabling range selection to identify anomalies or visualize changes over time.
  - The amplitude strategy (Top/Base or Peak-to-Peak) can now be selected for Rise/Fall Time and Rise/Fall Rate measurements and math channels.
  - Measurements can now be selected or deselected to show or hide their graph indicators, with only one measurements indicators displayed at a time. This is currently supported for Pk-Pk, Min, Max, Edge Count, Cycle Time, Frequency, Pulse Width, Rise/Fall Time, Rise/Fall Rate, RMS, RMS ripple, Top/Base, Amplitude, Mean, Phase, Delay, Duty Cycle, Overshoot and Crest Factor measurements. The feature can be enabled or disabled in Add Measurement > Settings.
  - Serial decoder filters now display the filtered data on the graph.
  - Serial decoding filter settings are now saved within .psdata and .pssettings files.
  - Added an isoSPI decoder to Serial Decoding.
  - Actions can now be configured to trigger when a measurement passes or fails its limit, either for specific measurements or across all added measurements.
  - Ruler values are now included in printouts, when printing to PDF and when copying as image.
  - Phase rulers can now be locked together when moving them.
  - Ruler delta and tracking ruler values can now be selected and copied.
  - Waveform capture times can now be exported to a CSV file via the Waveform Navigator and Save dialog.
  - A new tool button has been added to return to factory settings, alongside the existing Reset Configuration control, which restores settings from the start of the session (Factory, User-defined, or Last Session settings).
  - Measurements, Notes and Ruler information is now appended when saving as PNG.
  - Spectrum view data can now be exported to the Matlab file format.
  - Reference waveform delay adjustment has been improved to cover the entire current capture time.
  - Setup Wizard has been added to the top toolbar for quick access.
  - Numeric values can now be fine-adjusted by holding the SHIFT key while using the + / - buttons or mouse wheel.
  - Some translations updates.

  Bug fixes
  - Resolved an issue where the trace could flicker when zooming in Persistence mode.
  - Spectrum views now update correctly when the number of bins is changed after stopping a capture.
  - Resolved an issue where the Start Up/Down control in Spectrum skipped a value when clicking the - button.
  - Resolved an issue when exporting serial decoded data in ODS file format.
  - Fixed an issue in which Serial Decoding settings were not saved when channels were disabled and re-enabled.
  - Resolved an issue where Auto Range did not function with overranged input when a linear probe was in use.
  - Improvements to edge count measurement stability.
  - Resolved an issue where only a single buffer could be captured in certain situations.
  - Various timestamp-related fixes have been implemented.
  - Improvements have been made to address slow or unresponsive rulers when used with math channels and large datasets.
  - Saving user default .pssettings files no longer causes subsequent customer data file saves to default to AppData\Local\Pico Technology.
  - Fixed a hang when trying to export large captures with maths channels to csv.
  - Resolved an issue when loading files containing serial decoded data saved in older PS7 versions.
  - Fixed a software hang that occurred during the export of large captures containing math channels to CSV format.
  - Resolved an issue where actions triggered by a mask limit test results could become unsynchronized.
  - Resolved an issue where the "Stop Capture" action in Actions would not trigger in certain situations.
  - Resolved an issue where part of the trace could temporarily disappear when zooming with multiple viewports.
  - Tabbed viewports now display graphs correctly when loading files.
  - Resolved an issue that made graph adornments difficult to move when using touch controls.
  - Some general performance optimisations when opening the Save dialog, when using the Waveform Navigator and after capturing with Rapid trigger.
  - General stability fixes have been applied.
  - [Toolbox] PicoScope 7 and Toolbox are now aligned, allowing selection of engine capacities up to 150 litres.
  - [Toolbox] The Maximise button no longer closes Toolbox.
  - [PicoDiagnostics] Compression test translation has been fixed for Italian.
  - [PicoDiagnostics] Resolved an issue where road speed vibration orders were displayed incorrectly.
  - [PicoDiagnostics] Resolved an issue where RP1210 devices were not displaying the port.
  - [PicoDiagnostics] Resolved an issue where the crash reporter was not displayed when PicoDiagnostics crashed.
  - [PicoDiagnostics] Resolved an issue with ELM327 connections.
  - [PicoDiagnostics] Resolved multiple NVH powertrain view issues.
  - [PicoDiagnostics] Accelerometer calibration support reinstated.
  - [PicoDiagnostics] RP1210 bug fixes.
  - [PicoDiagnostics] Minor updates to improve stability.
  - [PicoDiagnostics] Other general bug fixes.
  - [PicoDiagnostics] Improved debug logging.
