  - Clicking on a session entry in the RSW homepage will always attempt to launch it – the title is no longer a link. Clicking on “Info” will always show info. (Pro #3082)
  - With the options launcher-sessions-create-container-user, and launcher-sessions-container-forward-groups enabled, RSW will now add a group to the user even if the group with a matching id exists but with a different name. (Pro #2971)
  - Added SSL communication between RSW and remote sessions (using the job launcher). It’s enabled by default and can be disabled in rserver.conf by setting session-ssl-enabled=0. Certificates are generated for each job by default or can be manually configured. (Pro #3026)

  - Sessions that attempt to automatically suspend, but were blocked by some operation, will report what’s blocking suspension in the IDE in the R Console toolbar (Pro #2618)
