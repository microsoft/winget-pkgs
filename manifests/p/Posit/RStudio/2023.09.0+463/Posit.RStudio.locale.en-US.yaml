ReleaseNotes: |-
  New
  RStudio
  - Update to Electron 25.5.0 (#13457)
  - Add support Quarto Manuscript projects, a new Quarto feature that will be released in Quarto 1.4.
  - Added option to sign Git commits (#1865)
  - Add section to theme generation that will use theme-specific color(s) to set colors of vim/emacs-mode cursor
  Posit Workbench
  - An initial set of Prometheus metrics and grafana dashboard are available for the Workbench server (rstudio/rstudio-pro#3273)
  - Additional support for publishing new content types to Posit Cloud (rstudio/rstudio-pro#4541)
  - Update code-server to version 4.14.1 (VS Code version 1.79.2) bundled with node 16.20.2 (rstudio/rstudio-pro#4774, rstudio/rstudio-pro#5012)
  - Update rserver-saml to 0.7.0 (rstudio/rstudio-pro#4903)
  - Change the default behavior of the load-balancer configuration setting launcher-balancing-enabled to always be true. This has no effect on non load-balanced environments. (rstudio/rstudio-pro#4953)
  - Auto-generate the secure-cookie-key and launcher key pair in load-balanced environments (rstudio/rstudio-pro#4985)
  - Add the secure-cookie-key and launcher key pair to the node table of the database for load-balanced environments. (rstudio/rstudio-pro#4985)
  - Multiple instances of the Slurm plugin can now point at the same backing cluster without interfering with one another, provided they have different names (rstudio/launcher#706)
  - The Slurm plugin now has a default-partition setting that allows choosing a different partition than the cluster-wide default. The default partition is also put at the top of the list and highlighted in the UI when launching sessions (rstudio/launcher#551, rstudio/launcher#627, rstudio/rstudio-pro#4658)
  - Resource profiles for the Slurm plugin now support setting the partition (rstudio/launcher#695, rstudio/rstudio-pro#4658)
  - Resource profiles for the Kubernetes plugin now support setting placement constraints (rstudio/launcher#714, rstudio/rstudio-pro#4767)
  - When launching sessions or Workbench jobs, available clusters are now shown only when there is more than one option (rstudio/rstudio-pro#4675)
  - Non-shared projects on the home page no longer show a superfluous “Owner” field (rstudio/rstudio-pro#4984)
  - Users can now opt to receive desktop notifications when their sessions are ready, which is especially useful on platforms like Slurm or Kubernetes where this may take more than a few seconds (rstudio/rstudio-pro#3432)
  - While waiting to auto-join a session from the home page, the popup now shows additional status information on Kubernetes and Slurm and no longer warns about sessions that take more than 30 seconds to start (rstudio/rstudio-pro#4813)
  - Projects that can’t be found by the server are no longer completely hidden on the home page; rather, they are flagged as potentially moved or deleted (rstudio/rstudio-pro#4958)
  - Workbench now sets the SPARK_CONNECT_USER_AGENT environment variable for all sessions. This can help users of hosted Apache Spark clusters (including Databricks) identify when Workbench users are accessing Spark (rstudio/rstudio-pro#5015)
  - Security audit and file size optimization for VS Code Workbench extension (rstudio/rstudio-workbench-vscode-ext#227)
  - Added delete-node-on-exit option for load balancing to cleanup node table and fixed error caused by stale nodes (rstudio/rstudio-pro#4888)
  - Added explicit load-balancing-enabled option to rserver.conf (rstudio/rstudio-pro#4836)
  - Sticky sessions are no longer required to use OpenID Connect authentication (rstudio/rstudio-pro#2451)
