ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Changed from semantic versioning to calendar based versioning (Pro #2652)

  Python
  - Projects containing a Python environment are now automatically activated (#9489)

  Logging
  - In an effort to help make the RStudio Team products more cohesive, logging has been changed significantly.
  - By default, server logs will now be written to file instead of syslog. Warnings and errors will still log to syslog. This can be controlled by the warn-syslog parameter in logging.conf.
  - By default, server logs will now be written under /var/log/rstudio/rstudio-server.
  - Logs can now be written in JSON lines format.
  - Reloading the logging.conf configuration by sending a SIGHUP to the rserver process will now cause all RStudio managed subprocesses to also refresh their logging configuration.
  - Logging can now be partially configured using environment variables (RS_LOGGER_TYPE, RS_LOG_LEVEL, RS_LOG_MESSAGE_FORMAT, and RS_LOG_DIR).
  - Log files will now rotate by time in addition to the existing rotation by file size. This can be controlled by the rotate-days parameter in logging.conf.
  - For more information, see section 2 of the Admin Guide.

  - Use of the [config] or [nodes] headers, or the precense of nodes, in the load-balancing configuration file will lead to warning messages logged. (Pro #2167)
