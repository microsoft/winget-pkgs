ReleaseNotes: |-
  Deprecated / Removed
  Posit Workbench
  - We have removed support for decrypting or providing encrypted database passwords for the internal PostgreSQL database. Instead, we now strongly recommend a more robust authentication mechanism, such as SSL certificate-based authentication. When a password appears to be encrypted, Workbench will log a warning, and attempt to use it as an unencrypted password. For more information please see the Posit Workbench admin guide section on PostgreSQL.

  New
  RStudio
  - GitHub Copilot is available as an opt-in integration with RStudio. This feature is currently in public Preview, and has only been tested on RStudio Desktop. Copilot support is expected to be generally available in RStudio Desktop, RStudio Server and Posit Workbench in a future release.
  - Update to Electron 26.2.4 (#13457)
  - Upgrade Node to 16.20.2 (rstudio-pro#5275)
