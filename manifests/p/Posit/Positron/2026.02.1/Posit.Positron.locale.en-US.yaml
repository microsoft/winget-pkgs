ReleaseNotes: |-
  New Positron Notebook Editor is available for alpha testing! 📓
  We're excited to invite you to try the new Positron Notebook Editor, our reimagined experience for working with Jupyter (.ipynb) notebooks. While still in alpha, we're releasing early because we believe the best tools are built in collaboration with the community.
  The Positron Notebook Editor provides a batteries-included environment for data science workflows with integrated panes for inspecting variables and exploring dataframes, context-aware AI that understands your notebook's execution history and variables, and streamlined interpreter management.
  To try it out, enable the positron.notebook.enabled setting. Check out our documentation to get started, and please share your feedback!
  Connections Pane 🔌
  The Connections Pane lets you create connections to databases, explore their schemas, and interactively preview tables in the Data Explorer. This release expands Python database support with new drivers for SQL Server (via pymssql or pyodbc), Databricks, Snowflake, and BigQuery, each with multiple authentication methods including OAuth and service account options.
  For R users, database connections now also appear in the Variables Pane, making it easier to access and explore your connections alongside other session objects.
  Breakpoints and debugging in R 🛠️
  R now has first-class support for breakpoints in Positron. Set breakpoints in the editor gutter and step through your code interactively. In scripts, breakpoints are enabled after evaluation or sourcing. In packages, install the latest version of pkgload and call load_all() to activate breakpoints.
  This release also adds debug-specific command history; use Ctrl+R or Cmd/Ctrl+Up to navigate through commands from your debugging sessions separately from your regular console history.
  Check out the changes for this release.
