  New Features
  - The current working directory is now preserved across R and Python restarts. #3188
  - Enabled auto-update notifications by default. Future versions will automatically download and install in the background for Windows and Mac. #6296
  - Improved the matrix representation in the variables pane. #3656
  - Added new python.interpreters.include and python.interpreters.exclude settings to include additional Python interpreter search directories or exclude Python interpreters from the UI. #3574
  - Show summary statistics in Data Explorer for pandas columns with mixed data types. #3401
  - Note if a language session was used when making the Positron update check. #6388
  - Our new editor action bar is now enabled by default. You can switch this bar off by toggling the editor.actionBar.enabled setting. #6317
  - Copy-pasting when opening files in the data explorer from the file explorer (DuckDB backend) is now supported. #5157
  - Added an action to open Quick Pick to allow user to choose active runtime session, or to create a new one. Replaced main interpreter picker dropdown with a button to trigger this Quick Pick. Modified Positron action bar button to allow display of custom icon (vs. only Codicons as was previously) to support language icons in new interpreter button. #6150, #3596, #2143
  - Added support for custom icons in the Connections pane. #6187
  - R completions in specific contexts (such as with the ? help operator or inside debug()) no longer add trailing parentheses to functions. #1818, #2338
  - Positron now searches Workbench's recommended R installation directories during interpreter discovery. #6257
  - Positron now searches /opt/python for Python installations. #6254
  - Added an option to optionally apply a color filter to plots in dark mode for automatic theming. #6255
  - Sped up console startup and Positron now shows which interpreter will start. #3566
  Bug Fixes
  - The initial memory usage of the R backend (ark) has been reduced by 2/3. #5050
  - Fixed banding in the display of code blocks in LLM responses using chatlas. #6445
  - Fixed LLM response formatting from chatlas. #5819
  - Fixed scrolling in modal popups so that the last item in the list can be seen. #3061
  - Fixed a bug when autocompleting data.table column names. They are no longer quoted. #3140
  - Filtered out unsupported (<3.8) Python versions from the Python: Select Interpreter dropdown. #3740
  - Restored R package testing functionality. #6345
  - Ensured Python objects with invalid __qualname__ return values do not stop Variables inspection. #6237
  - Fixed bug when reconnecting to a database connection for which the 'host' attribute contained values that should be escaped. #5692
  - Fixed display of row.names of R matrixes in the Data Explorer. #6287
  - Synchronized VerticalSplitter state with column collapsed state in Data Explorer. #6318
  - Allowed _ to show up in the Python Variables pane if defined by the user. #3366
  - Fixed an issue causing some Polars query plans to break the Console when printed. #6258
  - User-specified R binaries now show "User-specified location" as reason discovered in R Language Pack output. #6257
  - Fixed the display of active runtime metadata in the Console. #6259
  - R: Lists display values are now truncated in the Variables pane. #6220
