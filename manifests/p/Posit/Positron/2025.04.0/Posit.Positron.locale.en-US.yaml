  New Features
  - [#6533, #6902, #6997, #7005, #7070, #7083, #7087] Made yet further improvements to our experimental multisession console support (especially in managing LSPs); read more at #6712 for how to opt in.
  - [#6811] Python 3.8 has reached end-of-life and is no longer supported.
  - [#5166] Unsupported versions of Python are now selectable with a warning.
  - [#4263] Improved Python language server support for notebooks.
  - [#6941] Updated the WSL launcher script to support kv9898.open-remote-wsl, a community-maintained Positron-compatible WSL extension. Thank you, @kv9898!
  - [#6270] Python interpreters installed at /opt/python or included via interpreter settings are no longer tagged as "Unknown".
  - [#4630] We now display a loading indicator for the small histogram/frequency table sparkline plots in the Data Explorer.
  - [#3658] Tooltips are now displayed for truncated data when hovering over a data cell in the Data Explorer.
  - [#5849] An explanatory tooltip is now shown when hovering over the null percentage graphic in the summary pane of the Data Explorer.
  - [#7074] Added new Environment Variables built-in extension to configure global environment variables for all consoles and terminals.
  Bug Fixes
  - [#6845, #6595] Fixed bad truncation of the Console prompt and the working directory in Console bar.
  - [#6798] Fixed runtime startup progress layout on Posit Workbench.
  - [#4504] Fixed bug where Haystack didn't think it was in an iPython shell.
  - [#6948] Fixed slow Python shutdowns and restarts.
  - [#6636] Fixed ipykernel bundling not being disabled via the appropriate setting.
  - [#3085] The Console now executes code entered before the runtime has fully started up.
  - [#6289] Python autocomplete now no longer inappropriately prioritizes magics.
  - [#7027] Pyenv interpreters are now available in the New Project Wizard when using the "native" Python locator.
  - [#7058] Fixed issue with missing or duplicated Python interpreters when installed in opt/python or included via interpreter settings.
  - [#4158] duckplyr data frames are no longer immediately materialized by the Variables pane. This requires the development version of duckplyr.
  - [#6903] Improved the default width of the Data Explorer summary pane on wide displays.
  - [#6898] Fixed occasional 1-pixel gaps in sparkline histograms in the Data Explorer.
