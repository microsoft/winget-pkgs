ReleaseNotes: |-
  - macOS packages now include completion files for elvish and fish shells
  (#221, @TymekDev).
  - rig available --list-distros output now includes PPM support, whether
  the a distro is retired, the EOL and in the JSON format also the last
  R version for that distro.
  - rig add is now better at detecting PPM support for new Linux
  distribution versions. In particular, new Linux distribution releases
  do not need a rig update to learn about PPM support. Relatedly,
  rig system detect-platform now does not report PPM support.
  Use rig available --list-distros to see which Linux distributions have
  PPM binaries.
  - rig run now exits with the exit code of the R process (#261).
  - Custom certificates via the SSL_CERT_FILE environment variable
  work again (#227).
  - rig library default does not crash now (#240).
  - rig now uses a better way to get the user's home directory, that works
  on systems without an /etc/passwd database (#228).
  - Windows: rig supports Rtools45 now.
