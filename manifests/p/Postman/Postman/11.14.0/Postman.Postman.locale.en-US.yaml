  What's New
  - The biggest update to variables yet!
    - Interact with variable values on the fly. Hover on a variable, view its value, and change it in the pop-over.
    - Focus on the variables that need your attention. Postman now highlights empty variables in the interface, so you don’t leave things out while making a request.
    - No more worrying about adding variables to a scope (collections, environments or globals). Just define a variable using the {{x}} syntax, pass the value, and you’re ready.
    - Note - Values for variables without scope are stored temporarily and are local to the request. If you want your value to be reused across multiple requests, add the variable to a scope.
    - Test requests faster with all your variables in one place! Click on the button next to the environment switcher to bring up the variables pane that bubbles up the variables used in the request and lets you browse all available variables from different scopes. Set your values, hit Send, change the values, and hit Send again.
  - An easier way to create environments.
    - Set up a new environment with the new 'Create Environment' button inside the environment selector.
