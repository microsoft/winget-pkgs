  Note on Betas
  Wav2Bar is currently in beta, which means that things actively change (UI, saves, etc.)! Please backup your saves, especially when updating Wav2Bar.
  Note for Linux
  Right now Linux is not very well supported, but I try my best to make it better bit by bit. For now you should be able to use Wav2Bar without much problem by using the zipped version or using the source code after installing the dependencies (see the README or the wiki). There are some predefined (but not tested) configs to make some other linux packages that you can try.
  Note for Mac
  Mac is not supported at this moment, but you can give it a try using the source code (see the README or the wiki).
