  1.53.2078 Changes:
  We’re pleased to announce that the latest version of Recuva has had a small update.
  This change introduces some improvements to Recuva’s integration with our licensing platforms.
  This groundwork will allow us to work on changes that will provide a smoother license delivery experience in future.

  1.53.2065 Changes:
  This change introduces some basic product usage data reporting so we can understand which Recuva features are being used and which are not.
  This will allow us to decide how we develop Recuva and build features we think our users will like.

  Basic product usage reporting, covering:
  • Feature usage (click events, so we can see which features are used and not used)
  • Inactive sessions (a ping will be sent back to our servers every 6 hours so we know if users have decided not to use Recuva anymore)
