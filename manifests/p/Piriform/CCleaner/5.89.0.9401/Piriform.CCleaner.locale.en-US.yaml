  Better cleaning
  • We are cleaning Chromium browser cookies again, after a change to where Chromium stores them. This affects all Chromium browsers, e.g. CCleaner Browser, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave, Vivaldi, Opera and Yandex.
  • We've added support for cleaning Firefox where it’s installed via the Microsoft Store. Every app installed via the Microsoft Store saves to a new location, so we will be working our way through other popular apps on the Store to ensure that CCleaner is able to clean them.

  Improved technology
  • We have upgraded CCleaner to use C++ 20. This allows us to work more efficiently and deliver app improvements more quickly.
