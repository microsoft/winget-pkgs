ReleaseNotes: |-
  Taking the hassle out of PC maintenance
  - We're bringing the convenience of regular auto-scans, helping ensure you keep your software up to date and your Windows system cleaner, safer, and better performing.
  - We've improved the cleaning of browsing history, data, and cookies for Opera so it works properly with the updated Opera folder structure.
  - We've also enhanced cookie cleaning, omitting logins to Adobe.com, for Chromium-based browsers in general, including Avira Secure Browser and Norton Private Browser.
  - The latest improvements to our cleaning capabilities cover Garmin Express map files, YouCam, iTop Screenshot and iTop Screen Recorder, iTop Easy Desktop, PDF24 Creator, Oracle VM VirtualBox, and TotalRecovery Pro.
  - We've updated the databases for Software Updater and Driver Updater to support more programs and drivers.
  - We have improved the user interface and overall experience for Driver Updater, new Software Updater, and Health Check.
  - New Cloud Drive Cleaner (Beta) is being made available to a small number of paid users. It helps find and remove redundant files to free up storage space and keep Google Drive organized.

  Fixing bugs and other improvements
  - We've corrected an issue that caused the showing of popup messages more often than expected.
  - In Driver Updater, we’ve fixed several issues that caused users to see an invalid update screen, or an empty screen and incorrect number of drivers to update after updating their drivers.
  - We have corrected partial freezing that some users might have experienced during a Health Check scan.
