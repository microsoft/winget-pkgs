  Maintaining cleaning reliability
  • We’re now cleaning Google syndication cookies fully in Google Chrome

  Making CCleaner easy to use
  • We’ve created a new way to register a license key in the product (find it in ‘Options’ > ‘License Key’)
  • We’ve improved the design of the screen to make it simpler to register your CCleaner license key
  • You’ll now see a more helpful message if something goes wrong
  • Finally, we have an improved screen where you can review and manage your license

  Keeping the app running smoothly
  • We addressed a bug that was causing the ‘Save to Text File’ action in the Uninstall tool to add unwanted whitespace, making it copy-paste-unfriendly for spreadsheets
  • CCleaner no longer crashes when importing cookies from a text file (‘Cookies to Keep’ right-click menu)
