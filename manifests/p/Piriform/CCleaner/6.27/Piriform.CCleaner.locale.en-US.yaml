ReleaseNotes: |-
  Taking the hassle out of PC maintenance
  - Now, when you close a CCleaner file cleaning notification, you are asked if you want to permanently turn off these notifications.
  - We've enhanced the Uninstaller so that it now deletes all CCleaner application data for all users of the PC, if possible.

  Fixing bugs and other improvements
  - When running CCleaner for an extended time, the app now displays only the most recently missed pop-up instead of all the pop-ups you missed.
  - We fixed an issue with the Health Check when it detected that a browser was running but did not close it before continuing with a scan.
  - The Windows Defender Quarantine folder has been removed from clean up.
  - The font size in the New Driver section has been corrected.
