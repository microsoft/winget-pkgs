ReleaseNotes: |-
  Expanding our cleaning
  • Added new temp file cleaning for Chrome User Data
  • Added new temp file cleaning for various Windows system components
  • Added new temp file cleaning for Microsoft Photos app
  • Fixed a bug in cleaning for Windows Game Explorer

  Even more reliable driver updating
  • Since its release in July 2021, we have put a lot of focus on minimizing the possibility of errors when using Driver Updater
  • This release includes two new safety features in our proprietary technology, which reduce the likelihood of problems occurring
  • Driver Updater is a feature of our premium CCleaner Professional product
  • You can check for available updates for free, but you get updates you need to either upgrade or start a free trial

  NEW! Automatic language detection on install
  • Some of you told us that you uninstalled CCleaner because it doesn’t have translations when, in fact, we support over 60 languages!
  • To remedy this, when you first install CCleaner, it will intelligently start up in a suitable language based on your system settings
  • This only affects completely fresh installations (over-the-top installs do not modify language settings)
  • You can change your language setting inside the app ‘Options’ > ‘Settings’ (more).
