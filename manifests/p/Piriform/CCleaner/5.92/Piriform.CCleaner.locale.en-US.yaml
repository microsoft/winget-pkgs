ReleaseNotes: |-
  In this release, we’ve expanded cleaning for Edge, Firefox and Chrome and renamed some files for better clarity around what CCleaner is cleaning.

  We’ve also released a preview of our new Performance Optimizer feature to a limited number of CCleaner users for their feedback.
  This new feature puts apps into ‘Sleep’ mode if they’re not needed to boost system performance.

  Expanding our cleaning
  • We added cleaning of bookmark backups in Edge and Firefox
  • We expanded our Google Chrome ‘Metrics Temp Files’ rule to include Setup Metrics
  • We’ve renamed the ‘Windows SubSystems Temp Files’ rule to “Network Data Usage” to make it clearer that this rule removes historical, statistical data about your network usage.

  Helping you to keep your PC running smoothly
  • We have released a preview of our new Performance Optimizer feature to a small number of users for their feedback
  • This new feature is not yet suitable for users of assistive technologies, but will be when fully released
  • We expect to make it available to everyone very soon! :-)
