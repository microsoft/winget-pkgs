ReleaseNotes: |-
  Taking the hassle out of PC maintenance
  - The Driver Updater database has now been expanded to contain more than 90 million drivers to help maintain optimal PC performance.
  - You are now able to cancel the downloading of driver updates currently in progress.
  - We've updated the Software Updater database to the latest version so that it includes additional apps and their updates.

  Fixing bugs and other improvements
  - We fixed an issue that could have caused CCleaner to interrupt the uploading of larger files to Google Drive when running a cleanup.
  - We resolved an issue where, in certain cases, the number of drivers to update displayed on the Driver Updater icon was incorrect.
  - The "Scan Now" button on the Health Status screen now correctly triggers the Health Check scan.
  - By enabling remote log upload in the CCleaner Support Tool in the case of issues, we are now able to collect larger crash dumps that cannot be sent by email.
  - The Support Tool is now saved to a new, more suitable location.
  - We have made improvements to boost CCleaner performance and stability.
