ReleaseNotes: |-
  Taking the hassle out of PC maintenance
  - We've improved the Health Check flow to provide you with more details about the status of each step and we’ve added a button to rescan the issues found. In addition, the results screen now better summarizes the scanning and cleaning results.
  - To help ensure that all your applications are effectively updated, the Software Updater now displays the list of currently running apps that need to be closed prior to update.

  Fixing bugs and other improvements
  - We fixed an issue where the Health Check could crash in the case of numerous temporary system files.
  - The "Revert selected drivers" button in Driver Updater is now enabled only if you select at least one driver.
  - We fixed an issue with several feature shortcuts that some users were experiencing.
  - The configuration of product messages about the amount of junk files to clean was adjusted to limit the number of popups.
  - We improved the licensing integration that was slowing down CCleaner startup for some users.
  - We made several improvements to CCleaner's usability and stability.
  - We updated the Piriform certificate to a Gen Digital certificate.
