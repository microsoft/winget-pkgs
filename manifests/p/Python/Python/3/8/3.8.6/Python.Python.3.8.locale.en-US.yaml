ReleaseNotes: |-
  Core and Builtins
  - bpo-41525: The output of python --help contains now only ASCII characters.
  Library
  - bpo-41817: fix tkinter.EventType Enum so all members are strings, and none are tuples
  - bpo-41815: Fix SQLite3 segfault when backing up closed database. Patch contributed by Peter David McCormick.
  - bpo-41517: fix bug allowing Enums to be extended via multiple inheritance
  - bpo-39587: use the correct mix-in data type when constructing Enums
  - bpo-41789: Honor object overrides in Enum class creation (specifically, __str__, __repr__, __format__, and __reduce_ex__).
  - bpo-39651: Fix a race condition in the call_soon_threadsafe() method of asyncio.ProactorEventLoop: do nothing if the self-pipe socket has been closed.
  - bpo-41720: Fixed turtle.Vec2D.__rmul__() for arguments which are not int or float.
  - bpo-39728: fix default _missing_ so a duplicate ValueError is not set as the __context__ of the original ValueError
  - bpo-37479: When Enum.__str__ is overridden in a derived class, the override will be used by Enum.__format__ regardless of whether mixin classes are present.
