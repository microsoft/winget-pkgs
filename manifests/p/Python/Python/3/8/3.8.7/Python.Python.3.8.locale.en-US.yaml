ReleaseNotes: |-
  Core and Builtins
  - bpo-32381: Fix encoding name when running a .pyc file on Windows: PyRun_SimpleFileExFlags() now uses the correct encoding to decode the filename.
  - bpo-42536: Several built-in and standard library types now ensure that their internal result tuples are always tracked by the garbage collector:
    - collections.OrderedDict.items()
    - dict.items()
    - enumerate()
    - functools.reduce()
    - itertools.combinations()
    - itertools.combinations_with_replacement()
    - itertools.permutations()
    - itertools.product()
    - itertools.zip_longest()
    - zip()
    Previously, they could have become untracked by a prior garbage collection. Patch by Brandt Bucher.
  Library
  - bpo-42630: tkinter functions and constructors which need a default root window raise now RuntimeError with descriptive message instead of obscure AttributeError or NameError if it is not created yet or cannot be created automatically.
  - bpo-42644: logging.disable will now validate the types and value of its parameter. It also now accepts strings representing the levels (as does loging.setLevel) instead of only the numerical values.
  - bpo-36541: Fixed lib2to3.pgen2 to be able to parse PEP-570 positional only argument syntax.
  - bpo-42375: subprocess module update for DragonFlyBSD support.
  - bpo-39825: Windows: Change sysconfig.get_config_var('EXT_SUFFIX') to the expected full platform_tag.extension format. Previously it was hard-coded to .pyd, now it is compatible with distutils.sysconfig and will result in something like .cp38-win_amd64.pyd. This brings windows into conformance with the other platforms.
  - bpo-39101: Fixed tests using IsolatedAsyncioTestCase from hanging on BaseExceptions.
  - bpo-41907: fix format() behavior for IntFlag
  - bpo-41889: Enum: fix regression involving inheriting a multiply-inherited enum
  - bpo-41891: Ensure asyncio.wait_for waits for task completion
  - bpo-40219: Lowered tkinter.ttk.LabeledScale dummy widget to prevent hiding part of the content label.
  - bpo-40084: Fix Enum.__dir__: dir(Enum.member) now includes attributes as well as methods.
  Documentation
  - bpo-17140: Add documentation for the multiprocessing.pool.ThreadPool class.
  Build
  - bpo-42604: Now all platforms use a value for the “EXT_SUFFIX” build variable derived from SOABI (for instance in freeBSD, “EXT_SUFFIX” is now “.cpython-310d.so” instead of “.so”). Previosuly only Linux, Mac and VxWorks were using a value for “EXT_SUFFIX” that included “SOABI”.
  - bpo-42598: Fix implicit function declarations in configure which could have resulted in incorrect configuration checks. Patch contributed by Joshua Root.
  Tools/Demos
  - bpo-42613: Fix freeze.py tool to use the prope config and library directories. Patch by Victor Stinner.
