  - Issue #21425: Fix flushing of standard streams in the interactive interpreter.
  - Issue #21435: In rare cases, when running finalizers on objects in cyclic trash a bad pointer dereference could occur due to a subtle flaw in internal iteration logic.
  Library
  - Issue #10744: Fix PEP 3118 format strings on ctypes objects with a nontrivial shape.
  - Issue #20998: Fixed re.fullmatch() of repeated single character pattern with ignore case. Original patch by Matthew Barnett.
  - Issue #21075: fileinput.FileInput now reads bytes from standard stream if binary mode is specified. Patch by Sam Kimbrel.
  - Issue #21396: Fix TextIOWrapper(..., write_through=True) to not force a flush() on the underlying binary stream. Patch by akira.
  - Issue #21470: Do a better job seeding the random number generator by using enough bytes to span the full state space of the Mersenne Twister.
  - Issue #21398: Fix an unicode error in the pydoc pager when the documentation contains characters not encodable to the stdout encoding.
  Tests
  - Issue #17756: Fix test_code test when run from the installed location.

  IDLE
