ReleaseNotes: |-
  Core and Builtins
  - bpo-45121: Fix issue where Protocol.__init__ raises RecursionError when it’s called directly or via super(). Patch provided by Yurii Karabas.
  Library
  - bpo-45234: Fixed a regression in copyfile(), copy(), copy2() raising FileNotFoundError when source is a directory, which should raise IsADirectoryError
  Documentation
  - bpo-45216: Remove extra documentation listing methods in difflib. It was rendering twice in pydoc and was outdated in some places.
  - bpo-45024: collections.abc documentation has been expanded to explicitly cover how instance and subclass checks work, with additional doctest examples and an exhaustive list of ABCs which test membership purely by presence of the right special methods. Patch by Raymond Hettinger.
  Tests
  - bpo-45128: Fix test_multiprocessing_fork failure due to test_logging and sys.modules manipulation.
  - bpo-44860: Update test_sysconfig.test_user_similar() for the posix_user scheme: platlib doesn’t use sys.platlibdir. Patch by Victor Stinner.
  Build
  - bpo-45067: The ncurses function extended_color_content was introduced in 2017
    (https://invisible-island.net/ncurses/NEWS.html#index-t20170401). The
    ncurses-devel package in CentOS 7 had a older version ncurses resulted in compilation error. For compiling ncurses with extended color support, we verify the version of the ncurses library >= 20170401.
  IDLE
  - bpo-45193: Make completion boxes appear on Ubuntu again.
  C API
  - bpo-45307: Restore the private C API function _PyImport_FindExtensionObject(). It will be removed in Python 3.11.
