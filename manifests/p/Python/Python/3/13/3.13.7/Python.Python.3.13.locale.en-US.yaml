ReleaseNotes: |-
  Library
  - gh-137583: Fix a deadlock introduced in 3.13.6 when a call to ssl.SSLSocket.recv was blocked in one thread, and then another method on the object (such as ssl.SSLSocket.send) was subsequently called in another thread.
  - gh-137044: Return large limit values as positive integers instead of negative integers in resource.getrlimit(). Accept large values and reject negative values (except RLIM_INFINITY) for limits in resource.setrlimit().
  - gh-136914: Fix retrieval of doctest.DocTest.lineno for objects decorated with functools.cache() or functools.cached_property.
  - gh-131788: Make ResourceTracker.send from multiprocessing re-entrant safe
  Documentation
  - gh-136155: We are now checking for fatal errors in EPUB builds in CI.
  Core and Builtins
  - gh-137400: Fix a crash in the free threading build when disabling profiling or tracing across all threads with PyEval_SetProfileAllThreads() or PyEval_SetTraceAllThreads() or their Python equivalents threading.settrace_all_threads() and threading.setprofile_all_threads().
