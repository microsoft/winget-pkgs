ReleaseNotes: |-
  Windows
  - gh-122573: The Windows build of CPython now requires 3.10 or newer.
  Tests
  - gh-59022: Add tests for pkgutil.extend_path(). Patch by Andreas Stocker.
  - gh-99242: os.getloadavg() may throw OSError when running regression tests under certain conditions (e.g. chroot). This error is now caught and ignored, since reporting load average is optional.
  - gh-121084: Fix test_typing random leaks. Clear typing ABC caches when running tests for refleaks (-R option): call _abc_caches_clear() on typing abstract classes and their subclasses. Patch by Victor Stinner.
  - gh-121160: Add a test for readline.set_history_length(). Note that this test may fail on readline libraries.
  - gh-121200: Fix test_expanduser_pwd2() of test_posixpath. Call getpwnam() to get pw_dir, since it can be different than getpwall() pw_dir. Patch by Victor Stinner.
  - gh-121188: When creating the JUnit XML file, regrtest now escapes characters which are invalid in XML, such as the chr(27) control character used in ANSI escape sequences. Patch by Victor Stinner.
  Security
  - gh-121957: Fixed missing audit events around interactive use of Python, now also properly firing for python -i, as well as for python -m asyncio. The event in question is cpython.run_stdin.
  - gh-122133: Authenticate the socket connection for the socket.socketpair() fallback on platforms where AF_UNIX is not available like Windows.
    Patch by Gregory P. Smith <greg@krypto.org> and Seth Larson <seth@python.org>. Reported by Ellie <el@horse64.org>
  Library
  - gh-122744: Bump the version of pip bundled in ensurepip to version 24.2.
  - gh-122334: Fix crash when importing ssl after the main interpreter restarts.
  - gh-87320: In code.InteractiveInterpreter, handle exceptions caused by calling a non-default sys.excepthook(). Before, the exception bubbled up to the caller, ending the REPL.
  - gh-122400: Handle ValueErrors raised by os.stat() in filecmp.dircmp and filecmp.cmpfiles(). Patch by Bénédikt Tran.
  - gh-122311: Fix some error messages in pickle.
  - gh-121650: email headers with embedded newlines are now quoted on output. The generator will now refuse to serialize (write) headers that are unsafely folded or delimited; see verify_generated_headers. (Contributed by Bas Bloemsaat and Petr Viktorin in gh-121650.)
  - gh-122332: Fixed segfault with asyncio.Task.get_coro() when using an eager task factory.
  - gh-122170: Handle ValueErrors raised by os.stat() in linecache. Patch by Bénédikt Tran.
  - gh-121723: Make logging.config.dictConfig() accept any object implementing the Queue public API. See the queue configuration section for details. Patch by Bénédikt Tran.
  - gh-82951: Serializing objects with complex __qualname__ (such as unbound methods and nested classes) by name no longer involves serializing parent objects by value in pickle protocols < 4.
  - gh-120930: Fixed a bug introduced by gh-92081 that added an incorrect extra blank to encoded words occurring in wrapped headers.
  - gh-121474: Fix missing sanity check for parties arg in threading.Barrier constructor. Patch by Clinton Christian (pygeek).
  - gh-121025: Improve the __repr__() of functools.partialmethod. Patch by Bénédikt Tran.
  - gh-121018: Fixed issues where argparse.ArgumentParser.parse_args() did not honor exit_on_error=False. Based on patch by Ben Hsing.
  - gh-119614: Fix truncation of strings with embedded null characters in some internal operations in tkinter.
  - gh-120910: When reading installed files from an egg, use relative_to(walk_up=True) to honor files installed outside of the installation root.
  - gh-101830: Accessing the tkinter object’s string representation no longer converts the underlying Tcl object to a string on Windows.
  - gh-120811: Fix possible memory leak in contextvars.Context.run().
  - gh-120769: Make empty line in pdb repeats the last command even when the command is from cmdqueue.
  - gh-120732: Fix name passing to unittest.mock.Mock object when using unittest.mock.create_autospec().
  - gh-120495: Fix incorrect exception handling in Tab Nanny. Patch by Wulian233.
  - gh-120343: Fix column offset reporting for tokens that come after multiline f-strings in the tokenize module.
  - gh-119600: Fix unittest.mock.patch() to not read attributes of the target when new_callable is set. Patch by Robert Collins.
  - gh-120289: Fixed the use-after-free issue in cProfile by disallowing disable() and clear() in external timers.
  - gh-114053: Fix edge-case bug where typing.get_type_hints() would produce incorrect results if type parameters in a class scope were overridden by assignments in a class scope and from __future__ import annotations semantics were enabled. Patch by Alex Waygood.
  - gh-114053: Fix erroneous NameError when calling inspect.get_annotations() with eval_str=True` on a class that made use of

    PEP 695 type parameters in a module that had from __future__ import annotations at the top of the file. Patch by Alex Waygood.
  - gh-120268: Prohibit passing None to pure-Python datetime.date.fromtimestamp() to achieve consistency with C-extension implementation.
  - gh-120244: Fix memory leak in re.sub() when the replacement string contains backreferences.
