ReleaseNotes: |-
  Tests
  - gh-127906: Test the limited C API in test_cppext. Patch by Victor Stinner.
  - gh-127906: Backport test_cext from the main branch. Patch by Victor Stinner.
  - gh-127637: Add tests for the dis command-line interface. Patch by Bénédikt Tran.
  Security
  - gh-105704: When using urllib.parse.urlsplit() and urllib.parse.urlparse() host parsing would not reject domain names containing square brackets ([ and ]). Square brackets are only valid for IPv6 and IPvFuture hosts according to RFC 3986 Section 3.2.2.
  - gh-127655: Fixed the asyncio.selector_events._SelectorSocketTransport transport not pausing writes for the protocol when the buffer reaches the high water mark when using asyncio.WriteTransport.writelines().
  - gh-126108: Fix a possible NULL pointer dereference in PySys_AddWarnOptionUnicode().
  - gh-80222: Fix bug in the folding of quoted strings when flattening an email message using a modern email policy. Previously when a quoted string was folded so that it spanned more than one line, the surrounding quotes and internal escapes would be omitted. This could theoretically be used to spoof header lines using a carefully constructed quoted string if the resulting rendered email was transmitted or re-parsed.
  - gh-119511: Fix a potential denial of service in the imaplib module. When connecting to a malicious server, it could cause an arbitrary amount of memory to be allocated. On many systems this is harmless as unused virtual memory is only a mapping, but if this hit a virtual address size limit it could lead to a MemoryError or other process crash. On unusual systems or builds where all allocated memory is touched and backed by actual ram or storage it could’ve consumed resources doing so until similarly crashing.
  Library
  - gh-129502: Unlikely errors in preparing arguments for ctypes callback are now handled in the same way as errors raised in the callback of in converting the result of the callback – using sys.unraisablehook() instead of sys.excepthook() and not setting sys.last_exc and other variables.
  - gh-129403: Corrected ValueError message for asyncio.Barrier and threading.Barrier.
  - gh-129409: Fix an integer overflow in the csv module when writing a data field larger than 2GB.
  - gh-118761: Improve import time of subprocess by lazy importing locale and signal. Patch by Taneli Hukkinen.
  - gh-129346: In sqlite3, handle out-of-memory when creating user-defined SQL functions.
  - gh-128550: Removed an incorrect optimization relating to eager tasks in asyncio.TaskGroup that resulted in cancellations being missed.
  - gh-128991: Release the enter frame reference within bdb callback
  - gh-128961: Fix a crash when setting state on an exhausted array.array iterator.
  - gh-128916: Do not attempt to set SO_REUSEPORT on sockets of address families other than AF_INET and AF_INET6, as it is meaningless with these address families, and the call with fail with Linux kernel 6.12.9 and newer.
  - gh-128679: Fix tracemalloc.stop() race condition. Fix tracemalloc to support calling tracemalloc.stop() in one thread, while another thread is tracing memory allocations. Patch by Victor Stinner.
  - gh-128562: Fix possible conflicts in generated tkinter widget names if the widget class name ends with a digit.
  - gh-128552: Fix cyclic garbage introduced by asyncio.loop.create_task() and asyncio.TaskGroup.create_task() holding a reference to the created task if it is eager.
  - gh-128479: Fix asyncio.staggered.staggered_race() leaking tasks and issuing an unhandled exception.
  - gh-88834: Unify the instance check for typing.Union and types.UnionType: Union now uses the instance checks against its parameters instead of the subclass checks.
  - gh-128302: Fix xml.dom.xmlbuilder.DOMEntityResolver.resolveEntity(), which was broken by the Python 3.0 transition.
  - gh-128302: Allow xml.dom.xmlbuilder.DOMParser.parse() to correctly handle xml.dom.xmlbuilder.DOMInputSource instances that only have a systemId attribute set.
  - gh-112064: Fix incorrect handling of negative read sizes in HTTPResponse.read. Patch by Yury Manushkin.
  - gh-58956: Fixed a frame reference leak in bdb.
  - gh-128131: Completely support random access of uncompressed unencrypted read-only zip files obtained by ZipFile.open.
  - gh-127975: Avoid reusing quote types in ast.unparse() if not needed.
  - gh-128014: Fix resetting the default window icon by passing default='' to the tkinter method wm_iconbitmap().
  - gh-115514: Fix exceptions and incomplete writes after asyncio._SelectorTransport is closed before writes are completed.
  - gh-41872: Fix quick extraction of module docstrings from a file in pydoc. It now supports docstrings with single quotes, escape sequences, raw string literals, and other Python syntax.
  - gh-126742: Fix support of localized error messages reported by dlerror(3) and gdbm_strerror in ctypes and dbm.gnu functions respectively. Patch by Bénédikt Tran.
  - gh-127870: Detect recursive calls in ctypes _as_parameter_ handling. Patch by Victor Stinner.
  - gh-127847: Fix the position when doing interleaved seeks and reads in uncompressed, unencrypted zip files returned by zipfile.ZipFile.open().
  - gh-127732: The platform module now correctly detects Windows Server 2025.
  - gh-93312: Include <sys/pidfd.h> to get os.PIDFD_NONBLOCK constant. Patch by Victor Stinner.
  - gh-83662: Add missing __class_getitem__ method to the Python implementation of functools.partial(), to make it compatible with the C version. This is mainly relevant for alternative Python implementations like PyPy and GraalPy, because CPython will usually use the C-implementation of that function.
  - gh-127586: multiprocessing.pool.Pool now properly restores blocked signal handlers of the parent thread when creating processes via either spawn or forkserver.
  - gh-98188: Fix an issue in email.message.Message.get_payload() where data cannot be decoded if the Content Transfer Encoding mechanism contains trailing whitespaces or additional junk text. Patch by Hui Liu.
  - gh-127257: In ssl, system call failures that OpenSSL reports using ERR_LIB_SYS are now raised as OSError.
  - gh-126775: Make linecache.checkcache() thread safe and GC re-entrancy safe.
  - gh-58956: Fixed a bug in pdb where sometimes the breakpoint won’t trigger if it was set on a function which is already in the call stack.
  - gh-123401: The http.cookies module now supports parsing obsolete

    RFC 850 date formats, in accordance with

    RFC 9110 requirements. Patch by Nano Zheng.
  - gh-123085: In a bare call to importlib.resources.files(), ensure the caller’s frame is properly detected when importlib.resources is itself available as a compiled module only (no source).
  - gh-122431: readline.append_history_file() now raises a ValueError when given a negative value.
  Documentation
  - gh-125722: Require Sphinx 8.1.3 or later to build the Python documentation. Patch by Adam Turner.
  - gh-67206: Document that string.printable is not printable in the POSIX sense. In particular, string.printable.isprintable() returns False. Patch by Bénédikt Tran.
  Core and Builtins
  - gh-129345: Fix null pointer dereference in syslog.openlog() when an audit hook raises an exception.
  - gh-129093: Fix f-strings such as f'{expr=}' sometimes not displaying the full expression when the expression contains !=.
  - gh-124363: Treat debug expressions in f-string as raw strings. Patch by Pablo Galindo
  - gh-128799: Add frame of except* to traceback when it wraps a naked exception.
  - gh-128078: Fix a SystemError when using anext() with a default tuple value. Patch by Bénédikt Tran.
  - gh-128079: Fix a bug where except* does not properly check the return value of an ExceptionGroup’s split() function, leading to a crash in some cases. Now when split() returns an invalid object, except* raises a TypeError with the original raised ExceptionGroup object chained to it.
  - gh-127903: Objects/unicodeobject.c: fix a crash on DEBUG builds in _copy_characters when there is nothing to copy.
  - gh-127599: Fix statistics for increments of object reference counts (in particular, when a reference count was increased by more than 1 in a single operation).
  - gh-111609: Respect end_offset in SyntaxError subclasses.
  - gh-126862: Fix a possible overflow when a class inherits from an absurd number of super-classes. Reported by Valery Fedorenko. Patch by Bénédikt Tran.
  - gh-117195: Avoid assertion failure for debug builds when calling object.__sizeof__(1)
  C API
  - gh-126554: Fix error handling in ctypes.CDLL objects which could result in a crash in rare situations.
  - gh-107249: Implement the Py_UNUSED macro for Windows MSVC compiler. Patch by Victor Stinner.
  Build
  - gh-129539: Don’t redefine EX_OK when the system has the sysexits.h header.
  - gh-128472: Skip BOLT optimization of functions using computed gotos, fixing errors on build with LLVM 19.
  - gh-123925: Fix building the curses module on platforms with libncurses but without libncursesw.
  - gh-128321: Set LIBS instead of LDFLAGS when checking if sqlite3 library functions are available. This fixes the ordering of linked libraries during checks, which was incorrect when using a statically linked libsqlite3.
