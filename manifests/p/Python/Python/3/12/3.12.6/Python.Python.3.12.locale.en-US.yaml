ReleaseNotes: |-
  macOS
  - gh-123418: Updated macOS installer build to use OpenSSL 3.0.15.
  Windows
  - gh-123418: Updated Windows build to use OpenSSL 3.0.15.
  - gh-100256: mimetypes no longer fails when it encounters an inaccessible registry key.
  - gh-79846: Makes ssl.create_default_context() ignore invalid certificates in the Windows certificate store
  Tools/Demos
  - gh-123418: Update GitHub CI workflows to use OpenSSL 3.0.15 and multissltests to use 3.0.15, 3.1.7, and 3.2.3.
  Tests
  - gh-101525: Skip test_gdb if the binary is relocated by BOLT. Patch by Donghee Na.
  Security
  - gh-123678: Upgrade libexpat to 2.6.3
  - gh-121285: Remove backtracking from tarfile header parsing for hdrcharset, PAX, and GNU sparse headers.
  Library
  - gh-123270: Applied a more surgical fix for malformed payloads in zipfile.Path causing infinite loops (gh-122905) without breaking contents using legitimate characters.
  - gh-123213: xml.etree.ElementTree.Element.extend() and Element assignment no longer hide the internal exception if an erronous generator is passed. Patch by Bar Harel.
  - gh-85110: Preserve relative path in URL without netloc in urllib.parse.urlunsplit() and urllib.parse.urlunparse().
  - gh-123067: Fix quadratic complexity in parsing "-quoted cookie values with backslashes by http.cookies.
  - gh-122903: zipfile.Path.glob now correctly matches directories instead of silently omitting them.
  - gh-122905: zipfile.Path objects now sanitize names from the zipfile.
  - gh-122695: Fixed double-free when using gc.get_referents() with a freed asyncio.Future iterator.
  - gh-116263: logging.handlers.RotatingFileHandler no longer rolls over empty log files.
  - gh-118814: Fix the typing.TypeVar constructor when name is passed by keyword.
  - gh-122478: Remove internal frames from tracebacks shown in code.InteractiveInterpreter with non-default sys.excepthook(). Save correct tracebacks in sys.last_traceback and update __traceback__ attribute of sys.last_value and sys.last_exc.
  - gh-113785: csv now correctly parses numeric fields (when used with csv.QUOTE_NONNUMERIC) which start with an escape character.
  - gh-112182: asyncio.futures.Future.set_exception() now transforms StopIteration into RuntimeError instead of hanging or other misbehavior. Patch contributed by Jamie Phan.
  - gh-108172: webbrowser honors OS preferred browser on Linux when its desktop entry name contains the text of a known browser name.
  - gh-102988: email.utils.getaddresses() and email.utils.parseaddr() now return ('', '') 2-tuples in more situations where invalid email addresses are encountered instead of potentially inaccurate values. Add optional strict parameter to these two functions: use strict=False to get the old behavior, accept malformed inputs. getattr(email.utils, 'supports_strict_parsing', False) can be use to check if the strict paramater is available. Patch by Thomas Dwyer and Victor Stinner to improve the CVE-2023-27043 fix.
  - gh-99437: runpy.run_path() now decodes path-like objects, making sure __file__ and sys.argv[0] of the module being run are always strings.
  IDLE
  - gh-120083: Add explicit black IDLE Hovertip foreground color needed for recent macOS. Fixes Sonoma showing unreadable white on pale yellow. Patch by John Riggles.
  Core and Builtins
  - gh-123321: Prevent Parser/myreadline race condition from segfaulting on multi-threaded use. Patch by Bar Harel and Amit Wienner.
  - gh-122982: Extend the deprecation period for bool inversion (~) by two years.
  - gh-123229: Fix valgrind warning by initializing the f-string buffers to 0 in the tokenizer. Patch by Pablo Galindo
  - gh-123142: Fix too-wide source location in exception tracebacks coming from broken iterables in comprehensions.
  - gh-123048: Fix a bug where pattern matching code could emit a JUMP_FORWARD with no source location.
  - gh-123083: Fix a potential use-after-free in STORE_ATTR_WITH_HINT.
  - gh-122527: Fix a crash that occurred when a PyStructSequence was deallocated after its type’s dictionary was cleared by the GC. The type’s tp_basicsize now accounts for non-sequence fields that aren’t included in the Py_SIZE of the sequence.
  - gh-93691: Fix source locations of instructions generated for with statements.
  Build
  - gh-123297: Propagate the value of LDFLAGS to LDCXXSHARED in sysconfig. Patch by Pablo Galindo
