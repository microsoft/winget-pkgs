ReleaseNotes: |-
  Security
  - gh-103142: The version of OpenSSL used in our binary builds has been upgraded to 1.1.1u to address several CVEs.
  - gh-99889: Fixed a security in flaw in uu.decode() that could allow for directory traversal based on the input if no out_file was specified.
  - gh-104049: Do not expose the local on-disk location in directory indexes produced by http.client.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler.
  - gh-102153: urllib.parse.urlsplit() now strips leading C0 control and space characters following the specification for URLs defined by WHATWG in response to CVE-2023-24329. Patch by Illia Volochii.
  Core and Builtins
  - gh-105164: Ensure annotations are set up correctly if the only annotation in a block is within a match block. Patch by Jelle Zijlstra.
  - gh-104615: Fix wrong ordering of assignments in code like a, a = x, y. Contributed by Carl Meyer.
  - gh-104482: Fix three error handling bugs in ast.c’s validation of pattern matching statements.
  - gh-102818: Do not add a frame to the traceback in the sys.setprofile and sys.settrace trampoline functions. This ensures that frames are not duplicated if an exception is raised in the callback function, and ensures that frames are not omitted if a C callback is used and that does not add the frame.
  - gh-104405: Fix an issue where some bytecode instructions could ignore

    PEP 523 when “inlining” calls.
  - gh-104018: Disallow the “z” format specifier in %-format of bytes objects.
  - gh-103971: Fix an issue where incorrect locations numbers could be assigned to code following case blocks.
  - gh-102310: Change the error range for invalid bytes literals.
  - gh-103590: Do not wrap a single exception raised from a try-except* construct in an ExceptionGroup.
  - gh-101517: Fix bug in line numbers of instructions emitted for except*.
  - gh-103242: Migrate set_ecdh_curve() method not to use deprecated OpenSSL APIs. Patch by Dong-hee Na.
  - gh-102700: Allow built-in modules to be submodules. This allows submodules to be statically linked into a CPython binary.
  - gh-101857: Fix xattr support detection on Linux systems by widening the check to linux, not just glibc. This fixes support for musl.
  - gh-99184: Bypass instance attribute access of __name__ in repr of weakref.ref.
  - gh-96670: The parser now raises SyntaxError when parsing source code containing null bytes. Backported from aab01e3. Patch by Pablo Galindo
  - bpo-31821: Fix pause_reading() to work when called from connection_made() in asyncio.
  Library
  - gh-105080: Fixed inconsistent signature on derived classes for inspect.signature()
  - gh-104874: Document the __name__ and __supertype__ attributes of typing.NewType. Patch by Jelle Zijlstra.
  - gh-104340: When an asyncio pipe protocol loses its connection due to an error, and the caller doesn’t await wait_closed() on the corresponding StreamWriter, don’t log a warning about an exception that was never retrieved. After all, according to the StreamWriter.close() docs, the wait_closed() call is optional (“not mandatory”).
  - gh-104372: Refactored the _posixsubprocess internals to avoid Python C API usage between fork and exec when marking pass_fds= file descriptors inheritable.
  - gh-75367: Fix data descriptor detection in inspect.getattr_static().
  - gh-104536: Fix a race condition in the internal multiprocessing.process cleanup logic that could manifest as an unintended AttributeError when calling process.close().
  - gh-104399: Prepare the _tkinter module for building with Tcl 9.0 and future libtommath by replacing usage of deprecated functions mp_to_unsigned_bin_n() and mp_unsigned_bin_size() when necessary.
  - gh-104307: socket.getnameinfo() now releases the GIL while contacting the DNS server
  - gh-87695: Fix issue where pathlib.Path.glob() raised OSError when it encountered a symlink to an overly long path.
  - gh-104265: Prevent possible crash by disallowing instantiation of the _csv.Reader and _csv.Writer types. The regression was introduced in 3.10.0a4 with PR 23224 (bpo-14935). Patch by Radislav Chugunov.
  - gh-104035: Do not ignore user-defined __getstate__ and __setstate__ methods for slotted frozen dataclasses.
  - gh-103987: In mmap, fix several bugs that could lead to access to memory-mapped files after they have been invalidated.
  - gh-103935: Use io.open_code() for files to be executed instead of raw open()
  - gh-100370: Fix potential OverflowError in sqlite3.Connection.blobopen() for 32-bit builds. Patch by Erlend E. Aasland.
  - gh-103848: Add checks to ensure that [ bracketed ] hosts found by urllib.parse.urlsplit() are of IPv6 or IPvFuture format.
  - gh-103872: Update the bundled copy of pip to version 23.1.2.
  - gh-103861: Fix zipfile.Zipfile creating invalid zip files when force_zip64 was used to add files to them. Patch by Carey Metcalfe.
  - gh-103685: Prepare tkinter.Menu.index() for Tk 8.7 so that it does not raise TclError: expected integer but got "" when it should return None.
  - gh-81403: urllib.request.CacheFTPHandler no longer raises URLError if a cached FTP instance is reused. ftplib’s endtransfer method calls voidresp to drain the connection to handle FTP instance reuse properly.
  - gh-103578: Fixed a bug where pdb crashes when reading source file with different encoding by replacing io.open() with io.open_code(). The new method would also call into the hook set by PyFile_SetOpenCodeHook().
  - gh-103556: Now creating inspect.Signature objects with positional-only parameter with a default followed by a positional-or-keyword parameter without one is impossible.
  - gh-103559: Update the bundled copy of pip to version 23.1.1.
  - gh-103365: Set default Flag boundary to STRICT and fix bitwise operations.
  - gh-103472: Avoid a potential ResourceWarning in http.client.HTTPConnection by closing the proxy / tunnel’s CONNECT response explicitly.
  - gh-103449: Fix a bug in doc string generation in dataclasses.dataclass().
  - gh-103256: Fixed a bug that caused hmac to raise an exception when the requested hash algorithm was not available in OpenSSL despite being available separately as part of hashlib itself. It now falls back properly to the built-in. This could happen when, for example, your OpenSSL does not include SHA3 support and you want to compute hmac.digest(b'K', b'M', 'sha3_256').
  - gh-103225: Fix a bug in pdb when displaying line numbers of module-level source code.
  - gh-93910: Remove deprecation of enum memmber.member access.
  - gh-102978: Fixes unittest.mock.patch() not enforcing function signatures for methods decorated with @classmethod or @staticmethod when patch is called with autospec=True.
  - gh-103204: Fixes http.server accepting HTTP requests with HTTP version numbers preceded by ‘+’, or ‘-’, or with digit-separating ‘_’ characters. The length of the version numbers is also constrained.
  - gh-102953: The extraction methods in tarfile, and shutil.unpack_archive(), have a new a filter argument that allows limiting tar features than may be surprising or dangerous, such as creating files outside the destination directory. See Extraction filters for details.
  - gh-101640: argparse.ArgumentParser now catches errors when writing messages, such as when sys.stderr is None. Patch by Oleg Iarygin.
  - gh-96522: Fix potential deadlock in pty.spawn()
  - gh-87474: Fix potential file descriptor leaks in subprocess.Popen.
  Documentation
  - gh-89455: Add missing documentation for the max_group_depth and max_group_width parameters and the exceptions attribute of the traceback.TracebackException class.
  - gh-89412: Add missing documentation for the end_lineno and end_offset attributes of the traceback.TracebackException class.
  - gh-104943: Remove mentions of old Python versions in typing.NamedTuple.
  - gh-67056: Document that the effect of registering or unregistering an atexit cleanup function from within a registered cleanup function is undefined.
  - gh-48241: Clarifying documentation about the url parameter to urllib.request.urlopen and urllib.request.Requst needing to be encoded properly.
  Tests
  - gh-104494: Update test_pack_configure_in and test_place_configure_in for changes to error message formatting in Tk 8.7.
  - gh-104461: Run test_configure_screen on X11 only, since the DISPLAY environment variable and -screen option for toplevels are not useful on Tk for Win32 or Aqua.
  - gh-103329: Regression tests for the behaviour of unittest.mock.PropertyMock were added.
  - gh-85984: Utilize new “winsize” functions from termios in pty tests.
  - gh-75729: Fix the os.spawn* tests failing on Windows when the working directory or interpreter path contains spaces.
  Build
  - gh-90005: Fix a regression in configure where we could end up unintentionally linking with libbsd.
  - gh-104106: Add gcc fallback of mkfifoat/mknodat for macOS. Patch by Dong-hee Na.
  - gh-99069: Extended workaround defining static_assert when missing from the libc headers to all clang and gcc builds. In particular, this fixes building on macOS <= 10.10.
  Windows
  - gh-105146: Updated the links at the end of the installer to point to Discourse rather than the mailing lists.
  - gh-104623: Update Windows installer to use SQLite 3.42.0.
  - gh-102997: Update Windows installer to use SQLite 3.41.2.
  - gh-88013: Fixed a bug where TypeError was raised when calling ntpath.realpath() with a bytes parameter in some cases.
