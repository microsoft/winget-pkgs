ReleaseNotes: |-
  Security
  - gh-101727: Updated the OpenSSL version used in Windows and macOS binary release builds to 1.1.1t to address CVE-2023-0286, CVE-2022-4303, and CVE-2022-4303 per the OpenSSL 2023-02-07 security advisory.
  - gh-101283: subprocess.Popen now uses a safer approach to find cmd.exe when launching with shell=True. Patch by Eryk Sun, based on a patch by Oleg Iarygin.
  Core and Builtins
  - gh-101975: Fixed stacktop value on tracing entries to avoid corruption on garbage collection.
  - gh-102701: Fix overflow when creating very large dict.
  - gh-102416: Do not memoize incorrectly automatically generated loop rules in the parser. Patch by Pablo Galindo.
  - gh-102356: Fix a bug that caused a crash when deallocating deeply nested filter objects. Patch by Marta Gómez Macías.
  - gh-102397: Fix segfault from race condition in signal handling during garbage collection. Patch by Kumar Aditya.
  - gh-102281: Fix potential nullptr dereference and use of uninitialized memory in fileutils. Patch by Max Bachmann.
  - gh-102126: Fix deadlock at shutdown when clearing thread states if any finalizer tries to acquire the runtime head lock. Patch by Kumar Aditya.
  - gh-102027: Fix SSE2 and SSE3 detection in _blake2 internal module. Patch by Max Bachmann.
  - gh-101967: Fix possible segfault in positional_only_passed_as_keyword function, when new list created.
  - gh-101765: Fix SystemError / segmentation fault in iter __reduce__ when internal access of builtins.__dict__ keys mutates the iter object.
  - gh-101696: Invalidate type version tag in _PyStaticType_Dealloc for static types, avoiding bug where a false cache hit could crash the interpreter. Patch by Kumar Aditya.
  Library
  - gh-102549: Don’t ignore exceptions in member type creation.
  - gh-102947: Improve traceback when dataclasses.fields() is called on a non-dataclass. Patch by Alex Waygood
  - gh-102780: The asyncio.Timeout context manager now works reliably even when performing cleanup due to task cancellation. Previously it could raise a CancelledError instead of an TimeoutError in such cases.
  - gh-88965: typing: Fix a bug relating to substitution in custom classes generic over a ParamSpec. Previously, if the ParamSpec was substituted with a parameters list that itself contained a TypeVar, the TypeVar in the parameters list could not be subsequently substituted. This is now fixed.
    Patch by Nikita Sobolev.
  - gh-101979: Fix a bug where parentheses in the metavar argument to argparse.ArgumentParser.add_argument() were dropped. Patch by Yeojin Kim.
  - gh-102179: Fix os.dup2() error message for negative fds.
  - gh-101961: For the binary mode, fileinput.hookcompressed() doesn’t set the encoding value even if the value is None. Patch by Gihwan Kim.
  - gh-101936: The default value of fp becomes io.BytesIO if HTTPError is initialized without a designated fp parameter. Patch by Long Vo.
  - gh-102069: Fix __weakref__ descriptor generation for custom dataclasses.
  - gh-101566: In zipfile, apply fix for extractall on the underlying zipfile after being wrapped in Path.
  - gh-101892: Callable iterators no longer raise SystemError when the callable object exhausts the iterator but forgets to either return a sentinel value or raise StopIteration.
  - gh-97786: Fix potential undefined behaviour in corner cases of floating-point-to-time conversions.
  - gh-101517: Fixed bug where bdb looks up the source line with linecache with a lineno=None, which causes it to fail with an unhandled exception.
  - gh-101673: Fix a pdb bug where ll clears the changes to local variables.
  - gh-96931: Fix incorrect results from ssl.SSLSocket.shared_ciphers()
  - gh-88233: Correctly preserve “extra” fields in zipfile regardless of their ordering relative to a zip64 “extra.”
  - gh-96127: inspect.signature was raising TypeError on call with mock objects. Now it correctly returns (*args, **kwargs) as infered signature.
  - gh-95495: When built against OpenSSL 3.0, the ssl module had a bug where it reported unauthenticated EOFs (i.e. without close_notify) as a clean TLS-level EOF. It now raises SSLEOFError, matching the behavior in previous versions of OpenSSL. The options attribute on SSLContext also no longer includes OP_IGNORE_UNEXPECTED_EOF by default. This option may be set to specify the previous OpenSSL 3.0 behavior.
  - gh-94440: Fix a concurrent.futures.process bug where ProcessPoolExecutor shutdown could hang after a future has been quickly submitted and canceled.
  Documentation
  - gh-103112: Add docstring to http.client.HTTPResponse.read() to fix pydoc output.
  - gh-85417: Update cmath documentation to clarify behaviour on branch cuts.
  - gh-97725: Fix asyncio.Task.print_stack() description for file=None. Patch by Oleg Iarygin.
  Tests
  - gh-102980: Improve test coverage on pdb.
  - gh-102537: Adjust the error handling strategy in test_zoneinfo.TzPathTest.python_tzpath_context. Patch by Paul Ganssle.
  - gh-89792: test_tools now copies up to 10x less source data to a temporary directory during the freeze test by ignoring git metadata and other artifacts. It also limits its python build parallelism based on os.cpu_count instead of hard coding it as 8 cores.
  - gh-101377: Improved test_locale_calendar_formatweekday of calendar.
  Build
  - gh-102711: Fix -Wstrict-prototypes compiler warnings.
  Windows
  - gh-101849: Ensures installer will correctly upgrade existing py.exe launcher installs.
  - gh-101763: Updates copy of libffi bundled with Windows installs to 3.4.4.
  - gh-101759: Update Windows installer to SQLite 3.40.1.
  - gh-101614: Correctly handle extensions built against debug binaries that reference python3_d.dll.
