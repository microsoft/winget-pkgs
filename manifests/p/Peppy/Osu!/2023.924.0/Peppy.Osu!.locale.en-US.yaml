ReleaseNotes: |-
  Code Quality
  - Rename SliderVelocity to SliderVelocityMultiplier to distinguish from Velocity (ppy/osu#24728 by @peppy)
  - Add debug output for skin configuration lookups (ppy/osu#24726 by @peppy)
  - We've struggled with debugging these over the years so I think this was worth a couple of hours of work.
  - Clean up ImportTask / ArchiveReader implementations (ppy/osu#24807 by @peppy)
  - Remove LegacyDifficultyControlPoint / LegacyBpmMultiplier (ppy/osu#24738 by @peppy)
  - Parse only supported schemes as URIs (ppy/osu#24814 by @LukynkaCZE)
  - Refactor storyboard resource lookup to be more streamlined (ppy/osu#24809 by @peppy)
  - Fix issues after storyboard resource lookup refactor (ppy/osu#24863 by @bdach)
  - General improvements to README (ppy/osu#24875 by @peppy)
  Smaller changes
  - Fix masking broken with TexturedVertex3D (ppy/osu-framework#5987 by @smoogipoo)
  - Revert masking SSBO changes (ppy/osu-resources#279 by @smoogipoo)
  - Tidy up InterpolatingFramedClock (ppy/osu-framework#5992 by @peppy)
  - Fix opening links potentially causing crashes due to system misconfigurations (and log errors instead) (ppy/osu-framework#5989 by @yesseruser)
  - Remove local veldrid-spirv iOS native libraries (ppy/osu-framework#5995 by @frenzibyte)
  - Update all dependencies (except for Moq) (ppy/osu#24831 by @peppy)
  - Avoid throwing exception when attempting to access WebRequest response in fail path (ppy/osu-framework#5998 by @peppy)

  - Update clocks in line with framework changes (ppy/osu#24870 by @peppy)
  - Fix crash when clicking update notification on iOS (ppy/osu-framework#5991 by @peppy)
  Gameplay
  - Default to normal bank if invalid sample bank is specified (ppy/osu#24800 by @sw1tchbl4d3r)
  - Some existing beatmaps specify an invalid sample bank in the .osu file.
    While stable would fallback to the normal sample bank, lazer would - until now - just refuse to play the sample.
    This change replicates the behaviour of stable.
  - I considered having the slider ball not appear until the head is hit, but I don't think a change like this would sit well as it would potentially reduce readability
  - I intentionally made the snaking only happen on a successful hit. So if you miss the slider head completely, the outwards snaking will never complete.
    This could be a good visual cue.
  - The original plan I had animation wise was to have the portion of path before the slider ball's current position fade out on slider head hit, but this would mean duplicating the slider path.
    And I don't think this is a good idea from a performance perspective for such an edge case.
  Smaller changes
  - Apply further fixes to note lock when classic mod is enabled (ppy/osu#24720 by @bdach)
  - Apply further fixes to note lock when classic mod is enabled (ppy/osu#24762 by @bdach)
  - This change in particular moves across an edge case from stable wherein slider heads will always block input from reaching objects underneath them, until the slider is fully completed.
  - Update osu! spinner ticks calculation method to better match osu!(stable) (ppy/osu#24661 by @frenzibyte)
  - osu!(stable) calculates the spins requirement for completion in "half spins", meanwhile lazer tried to do roughly the same but applied a slightly overestimated 0.6x factor to "convert" into full spins. This PR updates the number of spins required to be closer to expectations.
  - Add two spins gap before awarding bonus score on osu! spinners (ppy/osu#24662 by @frenzibyte)
  - As it turns out, in previous lazer versions a player could gain two extra bonus spins on any spinner in any map compared to stable.
    For the sake of balancing, this PR mimics stable behaviour and adds a gap of two spins which need to be performed after required spins in order to receive bonus score.
  - Fix sliders not always being the correct length on some beatmaps (ppy/osu#24739 by @peppy)
  - Intentionally reintroduces some floating-point imprecisions from stable to fix a rare case wherein a particular beatmap was missing a slider tick.
  - Fix sliders not always being the correct length on some more beatmaps (ppy/osu#24848 by @Magnus-Cosmos)
  - Fixes another edge case beatmap wherein some sliders were too short.
  - Fix game crash when using "Bubbles" mod on a beatmap with no hit circles (ppy/osu#24889 by @Fabiano1337)
  - Fixes bubbles mod crashing when no HitCircle is placed in a map like in Issue #24444
  Gameplay (osu!mania)
  - Fix osu!mania legacy skin configurations not working when notes are not skinned (ppy/osu#24727 by @peppy)
  - Originally disabled a while back, but as far as I can tell this does not look required anymore (we have much better classic fallback support these days).
