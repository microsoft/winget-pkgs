  Skinning
  - Make spinner-top and spinner-middle2 spin at different speeds to match stable (ppy/osu#26562 by @kyubxy)
  - Change legacy beatmap skins to not handle @2x textures (to match stable) (ppy/osu#26594 by @frenzibyte)

  - Beatmaps like "new beginnings" store storyboard elements that match the name of a skin element in a nested folder (e.g.
    SB/k/hitcircle@2x.png). When stable looks up the element, it will not match it with any texture file in the user's skin, due to the user's skin not having any texture file with the path explicitly being SB/k/hitcircle@2x.png for example.
  - Fix storyboard animations stripping path directory on skin lookup (ppy/osu#26599 by @frenzibyte)
  Smaller changes
