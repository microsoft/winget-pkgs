ReleaseNotes: "Audio\nFix back sound being too loud when exiting many screens (ppy/osu#26612 by @peppy)\nCode Quality\n- Add Statistics bindable to IAPIProvider and update it from SoloStatisticsWatcher (ppy/osu#26356 by @stanriders)\n- Update localisations (ppy/osu-resources#303 by @peppy)\n- Fix score submission test failures due to checking audio playback validity (again) (ppy/osu#26669 by @bdach)\n- Update README.md to link to new development project (ppy/osu#26740 by @hrfarmer)- The ranked play GitHub project was closed and switched over to a new project, so I've updated the link to the new one.\n\n- Decouple notifications websocket handling from chat operations (ppy/osu#26724 by @bdach)\nEditor\nFix lag when dragging first slider control point in editor (ppy/osu#26499 by @OliBomby)\nFix timing point changes not applying after selecting another one (ppy/osu#26585 by @frenzibyte)\nSmaller changes\n- Fix glitchy path type correction for sliders in the editor (ppy/osu#26512 by @OliBomby)- Fixes an issue in the mechanism responsible for turning the path type to bezier when the perfect curve circle radius is too large.\n\nBefore:After:- Fix blueprint container not handling right clicks correctly while moving a blueprint (ppy/osu#26661 by @frenzibyte)\n- Fix slider sometimes not updating anchor position of nested objects (ppy/osu#26659 by @frenzibyte)\n- Prevent custom divisor ranges from halting divisor preset cycling (ppy/osu#26689 by @myQwil)\nFramework\n- Guard against potential usage of DrawablePool without being added to hierarchy (ppy/osu-framework#6136 by @peppy)\n- Make IPC port configurable via HostOptions (ppy/osu-framework#6129 by @tsunyoku)\n- Add flaky test attribute and mark CanSeekForwardOnInterpolationFail as flaky (ppy/osu-framework#6140 by @frenzibyte)\n- Fix TemplateGameTestScene showing up in test browser (ppy/osu-framework#6146 by @Joehuu)\n- Include rounded corner radius in android safe area implementation (ppy/osu-framework#6143 by @bdach)\n- Ignore autogenerated .idea android file (ppy/osu-framework#6144 by @Susko3)\n- Write log header later to ensure game identifiers are present (ppy/osu-framework#6138 by @peppy)\n- Add the ability to solo a test in visual testing using [Solo] attribute (ppy/osu-framework#6137 by @peppy)\n- Fix build warning (ppy/osu-framework#6158 by @smoogipoo)\n- Implement Padding property in GridContainer (ppy/osu-framework#6145 by @EVAST9919)\n- Fix nested absolute sequences (ppy/osu-framework#6160 by @smoogipoo)\nGameplay\nFix background dim occasionally getting in a bad state when exiting gameplay (ppy/osu#26544 by @peppy)\nFix holding keys before gameplay starts resulting in incorrect input (ppy/osu-framework#6101 by @frenzibyte)\nFade hold-for-menu button out completely on non-touch devices (ppy/osu#26542 by @peppy)\nSimplify gameplay pause sequence (ppy/osu#26605 by @peppy)\nThis removes the frequency ramp on pausing. This was something I was personally behind implementing and working to keep around, but nuking in favour of simplifying the process for now. In discussing with nekodex we both agree there is a better way forward than this.This lays groundwork for doing other things, like allowing seeking during replay pause, and changing the way offsets work without worrying about the weird application considerations from the pause ramp effect.Fix gameplay elements not correctly offsetting to avoid per-ruleset skin layout (ppy/osu#26609 by @peppy)\nChange S rank to require no miss (ppy/osu#26630 by @peppy)\nThis is a change for osu!/osu!taiko to match stable. It's not final. We're just giving people what they are used to for now. If you're about to comment about how you disagree with this, then please make sure to search first and contribute to an existing conversation.Smaller changes\n- De-dupe displayed hits in judgement counter (ppy/osu#26540 by @peppy)\n- Only display offset toast when in local gameplay (ppy/osu#26543 by @peppy)\n- Implement shaders for ArgonHealthDisplay (ppy/osu-resources#302 by @EVAST9919)\n- Fix argon health bar showing \"miss\" bar for bananas (ppy/osu#26561 by @peppy)\nGameplay (osu!)\nFix flashlight not dimming if slider head is hit early (ppy/osu#26576 by @bdach)\nFix cursor scale animation not matching stable on classic skins (ppy/osu#26567 by @peppy)\nAdjust slider tick / end miss animations to be shorter (ppy/osu#26668 by @peppy)\nThere's still a lot of feedback that these are noisy and get in the way. As a recap, you can already skin these out using sliderendmiss and sliderendtick, but adding these in a classic skin is a bit of a pain in the ass, so I want to make the defaults usable for most users.We'll continue to iterate based on feedback!Adjust slider tick / end miss visuals to be less noisy (ppy/osu#26703 by @peppy)\nMore subtle, less noisy, but still should describe the misses quite well.I toyed with bringing across the stable behaviour of ticks not fading out but people preferred this direction, so let's stick with it.Smaller changes\n- Fix pop-in scale transition in resume overlay affecting input area (ppy/osu#26545 by @frenzibyte)\n- Fix touch device not always activating when it should (ppy/osu#26575 by @bdach)\n- Adjust legacy slider misses to be smaller again (ppy/osu-resources#304 by @peppy)- People are still complaining so I want to first try to make them more subtle.\n\nGameplay (osu!mania)\nFix key overlay not showing special key in the right place (ppy/osu#26589 by @peppy)\nGameplay (osu!taiko)\nFix taiko maps containing only drum rolls / swells not being passable without mods (ppy/osu#26578 by @bdach)\nChange the input drum width to be consistent across all skins (ppy/osu#26632 by @frenzibyte)\nUp until now, the input drum width was variable per skin, which results in the overall gameplay width changing based on skin. This has been discussed to be quite bad and must not be the case (see discord).The constant width for the input drum has been defined to be 180px, visually matching osu!stable on classic skin. Default skins have been altered slightly to respect that width (basically set its height with respect to width rather than the opposite).Change hit target position in osu!taiko to always match stable (ppy/osu#26634 by @frenzibyte)\n| triangles | argon |\n|-----------|-------|\n| CleanShot 2024-01-20 at 02 01 21 | CleanShot 2024-01-20 at 02 01 01 |Move osu!taiko playfield down a nudge to match stable visually (ppy/osu#26635 by @frenzibyte)\nRemove rounding of slider velocity (when applied as scroll speed) (ppy/osu#26616 by @peppy)\nThis fixes some beatmaps using very precise slider velocities to create a speed ramp from looking too \"jumpy\".Fix osu!taiko's scroll speed not matching stable expectations (ppy/osu#26781 by @frenzibyte)\nThis finally brings osu!taiko in line with scroll speed on stable, even when \"classic\" mod is not applied.Smaller changes\n- Fix taiko input drum animation fade not matching osu!stable (ppy/osu#26608 by @mouzedrift)- \n\n- Rewrite osu!taiko playfield adjustment container to keep playfield height constant (ppy/osu#26631 by @frenzibyte)\nMain Menu\nFix toolbar buttons not being clickable at screen edges (ppy/osu#26530 by @Susko3)\nAllow adjusting volume controls via a drag (ppy/osu#26564 by @peppy)\nDid you know you could do this in stable? Well you can in lazer too now.Fix star fountains sometimes resetting visually (ppy/osu#26667 by @peppy)\nStarting/stopping the firing process was done very weirdly, causing the underlying class to get confused.Fix now playing beatmap backgrounds not being correctly centred (ppy/osu#26680 by @peppy)\nUpdate logo (ppy/osu#26704 by @peppy)\nSay hello to your new osu! logo. And don't trip on the dot.Update backgrounds (ppy/osu-resources#306 by @arflyte)\nBrand new menu backgrounds to match the fresh logo.Smaller changes\n- Update logo resources (ppy/osu-resources#305 by @peppy)\nMultiplayer\nFix touch device mod getting selected as a free mod in playlists (ppy/osu#26492 by @frenzibyte)\nRemember the user's selected multiplayer room filter mode (ppy/osu#26538 by @peppy)\nFix multiplayer scores not updating after failing (ppy/osu#26751 by @frenzibyte)\nSmaller changes\n- Fix multiplayer potentially selecting mods of wrong ruleset when starting match (ppy/osu#26496 by @frenzibyte)\nOnline\nAdd user card with global/country ranks to login overlay (ppy/osu#26340 by @stanriders)\nimageAdd two factor authentication flow (ppy/osu#25480 by @peppy)\nCredit to spaceman_atlas / nanaya for the API side of this implementation.Smaller changes\n- Update to use new score storage backend (ppy/osu-server-spectator#209 by @peppy)\n- Fix incorrect handling of StartChatRequest in websocket chat client (ppy/osu#26780 by @bdach)\nOverlays\n- Fix changelog stream user count only accounting for latest build (ppy/osu#26626 by @Joehuu)\nPerformance\nFix gameplay counter textures not being cached ahead of time (ppy/osu#26536 by @peppy)\nFix judgement pooling not working correctly in osu!taiko and osu!mania (ppy/osu#26546 by @peppy)\nReduces potential stutters when loading initial textures, plus should decrease gameplay overhead quite considerably (until now, each time a pool was requested for a different judgement type it would have to reinitialise the judgement's internal drawables).Rewrite ArgonHealthDisplay to use shaders (ppy/osu#26479 by @EVAST9919)\nHugely improves the performance of this component.Improve performance and visuals of glowing text (ppy/osu#26573 by @EVAST9919)\n|master|pr|\n|---|---|\n|song-select-old|song-select-new|Fix OsuPlayfield being retained indefinitely after gameplay (ppy/osu#26770 by @peppy)\nOuch.Smaller changes\n- Fix runaway texture uploads when window is minimised with frame statistics visible (ppy/osu-framework#6133 by @peppy)\n- Fix cursor ripple pool not loading pooled drawables ahead of time (ppy/osu#26547 by @bdach)\n- Fix DragStart and TouchMove input events possibly being handled by unrooted drawables (ppy/osu-framework#6135 by @OliBomby)\n- Fix ColourHitErrorMeter not loading pooled drawables ahead of time (ppy/osu#26549 by @bdach)"
