  Make flashlight scale with playfield (ppy/osu#26181 by @rushiiMachine)
  When the playfield is shrunk with mods such as BarrelRoll, flashlight does not account for this, making it significantly easier to play. This makes it scale along with the playfield Scale.Avoid stopping / starting gameplay when running behind but a replay isn't attached (ppy/osu#27504 by @peppy)
  Should fix the underlying issue causing the backwards seeks during gameplay.Add "Argon" performance points counter (ppy/osu#27498 by @frenzibyte)
  Add new hitsounds for "argon" skin (ppy/osu-resources#311 by @nekodex)
  My primary goal with this sampleset is to offer a fresh, modern take on stable/legacy's hitsounds that would work as a drop-in replacement for beatmaps that were created with stable/legacy's sampleset in mind.I've used reverb and increased stereo width to make the hitsounds less 'in your face' than the stable/legacy ones, making them more pleasant to the ear IMO. To compensate for potential audibility loss, I've used increased transients (punchyness), greater frequency range (with distortion/saturation/etc) and in some cases a volume bump to get them sounding equally legible.I also decided to shorten the samples (relative to stable/legacy) in response to modern beatmaps being of increased difficulty/hitobject-density compared to maps from back when peppy created the stable/legacy sampleset.In theory this allows for new players to progress further through harder maps before feeling the need to find an alternative skin/sampleset to hear what they're doing accurately - at which point, there's now conveniently also argon pro.The sampleset does diverge a bit in some aspects (i.e. spinner sounds, fail sound, etc) to lean into lazer's aesthetic, but otherwise I hope the hitsounds should still be recognizable as some facsimile of their stable/legacy counterparts and hopefully still feel and play just as good (if not better) than stable/legacy did.Smaller changes
