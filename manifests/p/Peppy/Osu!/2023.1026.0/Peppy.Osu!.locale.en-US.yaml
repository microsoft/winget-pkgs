  - Fix "Hard Rock" mod affecting CS/AR in osu!mania and osu!taiko (ppy/osu#25101 by @peppy)
  - Not sure if there are other exceptions we should account for here.
    This is mostly fixing this for visual purposes.
    We'd probably want to hide these stats in the mod select screen at some point if they are not relevant to a ruleset.
  - Remove drag handles from manage collections dialog for now (ppy/osu#25140 by @peppy)
  - The realm implementation doesn't support this.
    May come back at a future date, but this matches stable so it's not a huge deal.
  - Fix collections not being sorted alphabetically in context menus (ppy/osu#25139 by @peppy)
  - As mentioned in #21602#issuecomment-1762892636.
  Testing

  - Fix key binding panel test failures from introducing placeholder text (ppy/osu#25115 by @bdach)
  Tooling
  - Fix + improve diffcalc command for comment-based execution (ppy/osu#25159 by @smoogipoo)
  - The biggest change here is to use actions-cool/check-user-permission to check permissions.
    My intention is for only those with write permissions to this repo to be able to run the action via commenting !diffcalc.
  - Fix invalid PR URL in diffcalc GitHub action (ppy/osu#25169 by @smoogipoo)
  - As seen in https://github.com/ppy/osu/actions/runs/6570346137/job/17847635703

  - Fix dangerous buttons using different shades of pink (ppy/osu#25112 by @bdach)
  - Change beatmap listing key to B to match Ctrl-B shortcut (ppy/osu#25180 by @Susko3)
  - B is also better than D because the button says browse. This matches P for play and E for edit.
  - Localisation updates (ppy/osu-resources#291 by @peppy)
  - Limit image size in comments (ppy/osu#25202 by @EVAST9919)
