ReleaseNotes: |-
  Gameplay
  Fix beatmap offsets not being applied correctly to extreme rate changes (ppy/osu#27243 by @myQwil)
  Gameplay (osu!)
  Fix classic skins incorrectly applying scaling factor to approch circles (ppy/osu#27286 by @peppy)
  In triangles and argon, we expanded hitcircles to take up the full 128 px which are clickable, but still use the old approach circle sprite. To make it feel correct (ie. disappear as it collides with the hitcircle, not when it overlaps the border) we need to expand it slightly.Note that this fix only affects classic/legacy skins.| Before | After |

  Settings
  Remove Veldrid OpenGL renderer, always use (legacy) GLRenderer (ppy/osu-framework#6193 by @smoogipoo)
  Spurred by people using this renderer, likely because "legacy" has a bad connotation associated with it (e.g. https://discord.com/channels/188630481301012481/1097318920991559880/1209220240383418438).This forces GLRenderer ("legacy") to be used even when the OpenGL renderer type is selected.Song Select
  Fix beatmap carousel ordering not matching expectations (ppy/osu#27292 by @bdach)
  Broke in yesterday's release, oops.UI
  - Localise storage error popup dialog (ppy/osu#27258 by @Loreos7)
  - Update markdown code block implementation in line with framework changes (ppy/osu#27218 by @frenzibyte)
