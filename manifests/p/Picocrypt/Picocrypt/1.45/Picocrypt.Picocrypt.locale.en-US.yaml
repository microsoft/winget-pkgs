ShortDescription: A very small, very simple, yet very secure encryption tool.
Description: |-
  Picocrypt is a very small (hence Pico), very simple, yet very secure encryption tool that you can use to protect your files.
  It's designed to be the go-to tool for encryption, with a focus on security, simplicity, and reliability.
  Picocrypt uses the secure XChaCha20 cipher and the Argon2id key derivation function to provide a high level of security, even from three-letter agencies like the NSA.
  It's designed for maximal security, making absolutely no compromises security-wise, and is built with Go's standard x/crypto modules.
  Your privacy and security are under attack.
  Take it back with confidence by protecting your files with Picocrypt.
