ShortDescription: A very small, very simple, yet very secure encryption tool.
Description: Picocrypt is a very small (hence Pico), very simple, yet very secure encryption tool that you can use to protect your files. It's designed to be the go-to tool for encryption, with a focus on security, simplicity, and reliability. Picocrypt uses the secure XChaCha20 cipher and the Argon2id key derivation function to provide a high level of security, even from three-letter agencies like the NSA. It's designed for maximal security, making absolutely no compromises security-wise, and is built with Go's standard x/crypto modules. Your privacy and security are under attack. Take it back with confidence by protecting your files with Picocrypt.

ReleaseNotes: 'This release adds two new features: plausible deniability and recursive encryption. Thanks to @AsuxAX and @Minibus93 for helping me design and test these features. Additionally, the AppImage is now built on Debian 11 instead of 10, and the Paranoid Pack includes software rendering DLLs for the Windows executable to future-proof it as much as possible. Enjoy!'
