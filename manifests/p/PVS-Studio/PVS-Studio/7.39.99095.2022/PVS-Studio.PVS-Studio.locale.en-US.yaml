Description: |-
  PVS-Studio is a static code analyzer used to detect bugs, security vulnerabilities, and code quality issues in C, C++, C#, and Java programs. It functions as an automated code review tool to identify problematic code patterns early in the development cycle.

  Key Features and Strengths
  - PVS-Studio offers several features for integrating static analysis into development workflows:
  - Advanced Analysis Technologies: Employs data-flow analysis, symbolic execution, taint analysis, and intermodular analysis for deep code inspection.
  - Seamless Integration: Works within popular IDEs (Visual Studio, IntelliJ IDEA, CLion, Rider, Qt Creator) and integrates into CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins, TeamCity, SonarQube).
  - Legacy Code Support: Features a mass suppression mechanism to suppress warnings on existing code, allowing teams to focus on new code immediately.
  - Safety and Compliance: Supports coding standards like MISRA, AUTOSAR, SEI CERT, and OWASP for safety and security-critical environments.

  PVS-Studio is licensed commercially but offers free options for open-source projects, students, teachers, and closed-source developers who agree to place comments in their code.
