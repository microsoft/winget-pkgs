ReleaseNotes: |-
  âœ¨ Highlights
  - pixi exec command, execute commands in temporary environments, useful for testing in short-lived sessions.
  - We've bumped the default system-requirements to higher defaults: glibc (2.17 -> 2.28), osx64 (10.15 -> 13.0), osx-arm64 (11.0 -> 13.0).
    Let us know if this causes any issues.
