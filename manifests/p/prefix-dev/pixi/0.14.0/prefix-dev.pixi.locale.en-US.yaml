  âœ¨ Highlights
  We now support `solve-groups` in the environments.
  This makes it easy to align dependencies between environments without needing to install them all at once.
  This is especially useful when you have a `test` and a `production` environment, and you want to make sure that the dependencies are the same.

  [environments]
  test = { features = ["prod", "test"], solve-groups = ["group1"] }
  prod = { features = ["prod"], solve-groups = ["group1"] }
