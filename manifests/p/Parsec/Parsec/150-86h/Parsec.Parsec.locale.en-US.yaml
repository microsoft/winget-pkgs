ShortDescription: Remote desktop you'll actually love, in crystal clear, interactive HD. Connect to work, games, or projects wherever you are, whenever you want.
Description: Parsec is a proprietary freeware desktop capturing application primarily used for playing games through video streaming. Using Parsec, a user can stream video game footage through an Internet connection, allowing one to run a game on one computer but play it remotely through another device. Although its main focus is gaming, Parsec can also be used as low-latency desktop sharing software.
