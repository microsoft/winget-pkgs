Description: |-
  Parsec is a proprietary freeware desktop capturing application primarily used for playing games through video streaming.
  Using Parsec, a user can stream video game footage through an Internet connection, allowing one to run a game on one computer but play it remotely through another device.
  Although its main focus is gaming, Parsec can also be used as low-latency desktop sharing software.
