ReleaseNotes: |-
  - New configuration data for Factory Reset in Windows.
    Changes task's priority to ensure it'll run even on multiple unexpected cases. \#869 (SoraKenji)(Beregcamlost)
  - For Windows clients, Prey tries to send two different webcam pictures and there was an issue because those two tasks were interefing with each other.
    Now one runs after the other eliminating that error.
