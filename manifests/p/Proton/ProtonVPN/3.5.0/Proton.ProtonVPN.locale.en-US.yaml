Description: |-
  We built ProtonVPN with extra security features to make it better at protecting your privacy than an ordinary VPN.

  By routing your connection through encrypted tunnels, ProtonVPNs advanced security features ensure that an attacker cannot eavesdrop on your connection.
  It also allows you to access websites that might be blocked in your country.
