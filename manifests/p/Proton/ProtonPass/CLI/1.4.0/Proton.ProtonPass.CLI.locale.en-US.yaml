ShortDescription: Proton Pass CLI is a command-line interface for managing your Proton Pass vaults, items, and secrets.
Description: |-
  The Proton Pass CLI allows you to manage your Proton Pass vaults and items directly from the command line, bringing the power of secure secret management to your terminal workflow. With the CLI, you can create, list, view, and delete vaults and items seamlessly, making it an great tool for developers and system administrators who prefer working in the command line.

  Beyond basic vault management, the CLI allows you to inject secrets into your applications through environment variables or template files, enabling easy integration with your deployment workflows. The tool also provides comprehensive SSH integration, allowing you to use your SSH keys stored in Proton Pass with your existing SSH workflows.

  SSH agent integration
  - For developers working with SSH keys, the CLI provides robust SSH agent integration capabilities. You can load SSH keys stored in Proton Pass directly into your existing SSH agent, or run the Proton Pass CLI as a standalone SSH agent.
