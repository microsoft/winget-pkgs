ShortDescription: A cross-platform Electron application for quickly accessing and managing digital assets on Windows and macOS
Description: |-
  Pickit Desktop is a native Mac- and PC-based version of your Pickit DAM. It lets you work distraction-free by moving assets from Pickit libraries straight to any folder or app on your desktop—no browser or add-in required.
  Creatives can drag, drop, or copy/paste files wherever they need them, while admins can open an asset, edit it within the app, and save changes back to Pickit so everyone sees the latest version.
  It’s a simple, streamlined way to collaborate without losing control of your content.
