  Summary
  A massive thanks to @LuanRT for providing the fix regarding to the extraction of the deciphering functions. Also, big thanks to @PikachuEXE for coming up with a potential alternative solution!
  Important
  Please note that you may occasionally encounter Legacy Formats (available video quality, 360p) while playing a video. This is expected behavior, SO DO NOT SUBMIT BUG REPORTS FOR THIS. In these cases, FreeTube's video playback wouldn't work at all, and an error message (No valid URLs to decipher error) would be shown. This workaround allows users to still watch videos in those cases.
  Fixes
  - Update YouTube.js to 13.3.0 to fix the issue with the deciphering functions in #7077
  - Fix the Legacy Formats not working when the DASH and Audio Formats are unavailable by @absidue in #6977
  - Fix the proxy settings not being used during the PO token generation by @absidue in #6922
  Changes
  - Implement YouTube's newer PO token system by @absidue in #6931
