ReleaseNotes: |-
  Features
  • Complete database overhaul. Data should now much better sync up between windows (theme changes are still not synced)
  • Comments now show pinned, owner, and reply from owner indicators
  • Adding support for default custom arguments for external players
  • FreeTube should now recognize more channel links when pasting through the search bar / sent from browser extensions
  • You can now search through your history and playlists for videos
  • You can now import / export your playlists. Please export your playlists at some point before the next release as the next major release will likely be full playlists. Best to have a backup before that just in case
  • Downloading videos / audio is now done within FreeTube. You will be notified when the download starts and when the download is finished
  • Implemented "Stats for nerds" to show certain details about the video being watched. Right click on the video player to view it
  • Middle clicking on a video will now open that video in a new window (Also prevents non-YouTube links from opening up in a separate window)

  Fixes
  • Updated the ytdl-core module, which fixes the very recent buffering issue with videos from the local API
  • Fixed an issue where dates were not translated properly
  • Fixed various places where text would overflow from its container (ex.: autoplay, comments)
  • Fixed an issue where a user's playlist page would scroll to the top when loading more videos
  • The current playback speed will always be displayed when hovering over the list of playback rates

  Changes
  • Electron has been updated to v16.0.8, fixing an issue with video playback on older versions of Windows
  • The dislike count and the like / dislike ratio bar has been hidden due to the recent changes with YouTube. We'll look into possible alternates when a privacy respecting option exists
  • Certain settings will automatically get disabled when incompatible settings are enabled
  • Hovering over watched videos now show a smooth transition
