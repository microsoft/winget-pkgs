  Summary
  This hotfix release adds a workaround to return the original audio track instead of the dubbed tracks.
  A massive thanks to @absidue for finding this workaround.
  Important

  - This release does not bring back the audio track selector.
  Fixes
  - Make MWEB return the original audio track by @absidue in #7846
  - Fix subtitles being in the top right corner by @absidue in #7841
