ReleaseNotes: |-
  [!NOTE]
  The setting Export Playlists For Older FreeTube Versions will be deprecated in v0.24.0. This setting was introduced in v0.20.0 when we launched our full-fledged User Playlists. This allowed users to export their playlists into one big playlist and import the file into FreeTube versions older than v0.20.0. This setting is being deprecated because we don't recommend sticking with older versions of FreeTube. It is highly recommended that you upgrade to the latest version of FreeTube ff you are still using an outdated version of FreeTube.
  [!NOTE]
  This will be the last release to support macOS 10.15, as Electron v33.0.0 does not support this OS version. MacOS 11 (Big Sur) or later will be required to run future versions of FreeTube.
