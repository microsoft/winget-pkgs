ReleaseNotes: |-
  Summary
  This release comes with dozens of bug fixes, new player enhancements, user experience improvements, performance improvements, and features that we were able to implement thanks to the help of our users and new contributors. We hope that the scale of this update and its changes properly reflects our dedication to making FreeTube the best free and open source app it can be.
  We would also like to thank all the translators that make FreeTube more accessible to all of our users!
  Note
  The setting Export Playlists For Older FreeTube Versions will be deprecated in v0.24.0. This setting was introduced in v0.20.0 when we launched our full-fledged User Playlists. This allowed users to export their playlists into one big playlist and import the file into FreeTube versions older than v0.20.0. This setting is being deprecated because we don't recommend sticking with older versions of FreeTube. It is highly recommended that you upgrade to the latest version of FreeTube if you are still using an outdated version of FreeTube.
  Note
  MacOS 10.15 is no longer supported, as Electron v33.0.0 does not support this OS version. MacOS 11 (Big Sur) or later is required to run FreeTube going forward.
