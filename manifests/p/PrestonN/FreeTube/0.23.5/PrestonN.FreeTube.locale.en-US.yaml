  ## Summary

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  >
  > A temporary workaround has been implemented to fix the playback issues seen in #7119. This is
    not a permanent solution, and does not replace the upcoming implementation of SABR. The only
    drawback of this workaround is that on videos with multiple audio tracks, only the original
    audio track will be available. That being said, Stable Volume will still be available.

  ### YouTube Switches to SABR for All Video Playback

  - YouTube's Transition to SABR: YouTube has recently switched from the DASH protocol to a custom
    streaming technology called SABR (Server-Side Adaptive Bitrate). While both DASH and SABR were
    supported for a period of time, YouTube has now fully transitioned to SABR for all video
    playback across all YouTube clients, including the client type used by FreeTube. As a result,
    DASH support had been disabled for FreeTube users.
  - Full SABR support: We plan to reintroduce support for multiple audio tracks in version 0.24.0,
    once issue #7145 has been implemented. The SABR implementation is still a Work in Progress and
    is currently unstable with several known bugs. As such, we do not feel confident releasing it
    at this time.

  For more information on SABR see #7119 (comment)

  ## Fixes

  - Use the streaming data from MWEB to avoid SABR-only responses by @absidue in #7327
  - Remove broken Alpine builds by @absidue in #7129
