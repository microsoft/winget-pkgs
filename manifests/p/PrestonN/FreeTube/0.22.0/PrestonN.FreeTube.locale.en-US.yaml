  Summary
  Our Video Player has undergone a massive overhaul. We have switched from video.js to shaka-player. This allows us to add allot of new features and fix many issues. Notably, it's now possible to watch higher quality video streams. A massive thank you to @absidue for their help and support on this!This is a very large change to how we handle things. If you happen to see anything that seems broken compared to the last release, please consider commenting about it in the thread below so that we can look at it.For users hoping to import their subscriptions from YouTube, the process should be much quicker and a lot smoother since we no longer fetch thumbnail information when importing from YouTube. The channel thumbnails in the sidebar will be populated as you navigate around the app.We would also like to thank all the translators that make FreeTube more accessible to all of our users!Features
