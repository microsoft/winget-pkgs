  Summary
  This hotfix release fixes the This video is unavailable errors.
  Important
  Video loading times have increased because YouTube's servers now return errors if you attempt to start a video before the preroll ads have finished. While FreeTube skips the ads, it still has to wait until the preroll ad sequence completes before the video can begin playing. This is a limitation imposed by YouTubeâ€™s servers, and it also affects other YouTube-related projects, such as yt-dlp.
  Fixes
  - Wait for pre-roll ads to finish in /player request by @absidue in #7887
