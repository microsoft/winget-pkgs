ReleaseNotes: |-
  Ending Support for Windows 7/8/8.1 and macOS 10.13 / 10.14
  In order to stay in line with recent updates to Electron, this update drops support for all Windows operating systems below Windows 10 as well as macOS 10.13 / 10.14. These operating systems have been considered end of life for quite a while now and should also be considered a security risk. It is highly recommended that you switch to an alternative operating system if you are still using any of the ones mentioned above.User Playlists
  A long awaited feature is finally here! You can now create and manage your own playlists within FreeTube. Anything currently within your "Saved Videos" will be converted into a Favorites playlist.
