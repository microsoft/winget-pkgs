  Summary
  A massive thanks to @LuanRT for providing the fix regarding to the extraction of the deciphering functions.
  Important
  Please note that you may occasionally encounter Legacy Formats (available video quality, 360p) while playing a video. This is expected behavior, SO DO NOT SUBMIT BUG REPORTS FOR THIS. In these cases, FreeTube's video playback wouldn't work at all, and an error message (No valid URLs to decipher error) would be shown. This workaround allows users to still watch videos in those cases.
  Fixes
  - Update YouTube.js to 13.4.0 to fix the issue with the deciphering functions in #7252
  - Fix user-agent and referer for Innertube requests by @absidue in #7213
