ReleaseNotes: Local API Our local API has undergone a massive overhaul. We have switched all local API hooks to use YouTube.js instead of our separate modules for each function. This should hopefully allow us to fix any issues with the local API faster than what we could beforehand. Any relevant module that we have created has been merged into YouTube.js for a more uniformed experience. A massive thank you to @LuanRT for their help and support on YouTube.js.
