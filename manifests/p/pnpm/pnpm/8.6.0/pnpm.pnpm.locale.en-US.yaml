ReleaseNotes: |-
  Minor Changes
  - Some settings influence the structure of the lockfile, so we cannot reuse the lockfile if those settings change.
    As a result, we need to store such settings in the lockfile.
    This way we will know with which settings the lockfile has been created.
  - A new setting, exclude-links-from-lockfile, is now supported. When enabled, specifiers of local linked dependencies won't be duplicated in the lockfile.
  Patch Changes
  - Don't print "Lockfile is up-to-date" message before finishing all the lockfile checks #6544.
  - When updating dependencies, preserve the range prefix in aliased dependencies.
    So npm:foo@1.0.0 becomes npm:foo@1.1.0.
  - Print a meaningful error when a project referenced by the workspace: protocol is not found in the workspace #4477.
  - pnpm rebuild should not fail when node-linker is set to hoisted and there are skipped optional dependencies #6553.
  - Peers resolution should not fail when a linked in dependency resolves a peer dependency.
  - Build projects in a workspace in correct order #6568.
