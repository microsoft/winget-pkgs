   Lockfile Modifications
  - Lockfile v6 is adopted.
    This new format improves the readability of the lockfile by removing hashes from package IDs.
    It also has some rearrangement of fields in the importers section.
    The new pnpm-lock.yaml file is more resistant to git merge conflicts!
  - The registry field is removed from the resolution object in pnpm-lock.yaml.
  - A lockfile is generated even for projects with no dependencies.
   Other Changes
  - When there's a files field in the package.json, only the files that are listed in it will be deployed.
    The same logic is applied when injecting packages.
    This behaviour can be changed by setting the deploy-all-files setting to true (Related issue #5911).
  - Direct dependencies are deduped.
    If a dependency is present in both a project and the workspace root, it will only be linked to the workspace root.
