ReleaseNotes: |-
  Minor Changes
  - Improve performance of installation by using a worker pool for extracting packages and writing them to the content-addressable store #6850
  - The default value of the resolution-mode setting is changed to highest.
    This setting was changed to lowest-direct in v8.0.0 and some users were not happy with the change.
    A twitter poll concluded that most of the users want the old behaviour (resolution-mode set to highest by default). This is a semi-breaking change but should not affect users that commit their lockfile #6463.
  Patch Changes
  - Warn when linking a package with peerDependencies #615.
  - Add support for npm lockfile v3 in pnpm import #6233.
  - Override peerDependencies in pnpm.overrides #6759.
  - Respect workspace alias syntax in pkg graph #6922
  - Emit a clear error message when users attempt to specify an undownloadable node version #6916.
  - pnpm patch should write patch files with a trailing newline #6905.
  - Dedupe deps with the same alias in direct dependencies 6966
  - Don't prefix install output for the dlx command.
  - Performance optimizations.
    Package tarballs are now download directly to memory and built to an ArrayBuffer.
    Hashing and other operations are avoided until the stream has been fully received #6819.
