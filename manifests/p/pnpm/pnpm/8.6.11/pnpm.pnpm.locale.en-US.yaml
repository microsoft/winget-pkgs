  Patch Changes
  - Change the install error message when a lockfile is wanted but absent to indicate the wanted lockfile is absent, not present.
    This now reflects the actual error #6851.
  - When dealing with a local dependency that is a path to a symlink, a new symlink should be created to the original symlink, not to the actual directory location.
  - The length of the temporary file names in the content-addressable store reduced in order to prevent ENAMETOOLONG errors from happening #6842.
  - Don't print "added" stats, when installing with --lockfile-only.
  - Installation of a git-hosted dependency should not fail if the pnpm-lock.yaml file of the installed dependency is not up-to-date #6865.
  - Don't ignore empty strings in params #6594.
  - Always set dedupe-peer-dependents to false, when running installation during deploy #6858.
  - When several containers use the same store simultaneously, there's a chance that multiple containers may create a temporary file at the same time.
    In such scenarios, pnpm could fail to rename the temporary file in one of the containers.
    This issue has been addressed: pnpm will no longer fail if the temporary file is absent but the destination file exists.
  - Authorization token should be found in the configuration, when the requested URL is explicitly specified with a default port (443 on HTTPS or 80 on HTTP) #6863.
