ReleaseNotes: |-
  Minor Changes
  - Allow loading certificates from cert, ca, and key for specific registry URLs. E.g., //registry.example.com/:ca=-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----.... Previously this was only working via certfile, cafile, and keyfile.
    These properties are supported in .npmrc, but were ignored by pnpm, this will make pnpm read and use them as well.
    Related PR: #10230.
  - Added a new flag called --bare to pnpm init for creating a package.json with the bare minimum of required fields #10226.
  Patch Changes
  - Improved reporting of ignored dependency scripts #10276.
  - pnpm install should build any dependencies that were added to onlyBuiltDependencies and were not built yet #10256.
  - pnpm publish -r --force should allow to run publish over already existing versions in the registry #10272.
  - Don't fail with a ERR_PNPM_MISSING_TIME error if a package that is excluded from trust policy checks is missing the time field in the metadata.
