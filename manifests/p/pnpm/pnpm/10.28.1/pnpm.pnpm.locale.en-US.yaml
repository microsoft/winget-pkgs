  Patch Changes
  - Fixed installation of config dependencies from private registries.
    Added support for object type in configDependencies when the tarball URL returned from package metadata differs from the computed URL #10431.
  - Fix path traversal vulnerability in binary fetcher ZIP extraction
    - Validate ZIP entry paths before extraction to prevent writing files outside target directory
    - Validate BinaryResolution.prefix (basename) to prevent directory escape via crafted prefix
    - Both attack vectors now throw ERR_PNPM_PATH_TRAVERSAL error
  - Support plain http:// and https:// URLs ending with .git as git repository dependencies.
    Previously, URLs like https://gitea.example.org/user/repo.git#commit were not recognized as git repositories because they lacked the git+ prefix (e.g., git+https://). This caused issues when installing dependencies from self-hosted git servers like Gitea or Forgejo that don't provide tarball downloads.
    Changes:
    - The git resolver now runs before the tarball resolver, ensuring git URLs are handled by the correct resolver
    - The git resolver now recognizes plain http:// and https:// URLs ending in .git as git repositories
    - Removed the isRepository check from the tarball resolver since it's no longer needed with the new resolver order
    Fixes #10468
  - pnpm run -r and pnpm run --filter now fail with a non-zero exit code when no packages have the specified script. Previously, this only failed when all packages were selected. Use --if-present to suppress this error #6844.
  - Fixed a path traversal vulnerability in tarball extraction on Windows. The path normalization was only checking for ./ but not .\. Since backslashes are directory separators on Windows, malicious packages could use paths like foo\..\..\.npmrc to write files outside the package directory.
  - When running "pnpm exec" from a subdirectory of a project, don't change the current working directory to the root of the project #5759.
  - Fixed a path traversal vulnerability in pnpm's bin linking. Bin names starting with @ bypassed validation, and after scope normalization, path traversal sequences like ../../ remained intact.
  - Revert Try to avoid making network calls with preferOffline #10334.
  - Fix --save-peer to write valid semver ranges to peerDependencies for protocol-based installs (e.g. jsr:) by deriving from resolved versions when available and falling back to * if none is available #10417.
  - Do not exclude the root workspace project, when it is explicitly selected via a filter #10465.
