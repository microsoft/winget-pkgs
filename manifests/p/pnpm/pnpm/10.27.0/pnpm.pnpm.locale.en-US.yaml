  Minor Changes
  - Adding trustPolicyIgnoreAfter allows you to ignore trust policy checks for packages published more than a specified time ago#10352.
  - Added project registry for global virtual store prune support.
    Projects using the store are now registered via symlinks in {storeDir}/v10/projects/. This enables pnpm store prune to track which packages are still in use by active projects and safely remove unused packages from the global virtual store.
  - Semi-breaking. Changed the location of unscoped packages in the virtual global store. They will now be stored under a directory named @ to maintain a uniform 4-level directory depth.
  - Added mark-and-sweep garbage collection for global virtual store.
    pnpm store prune now removes unused packages from the global virtual store's links/ directory. The algorithm:
    1. Scans all registered projects for symlinks pointing to the store
    2. Walks transitive dependencies to mark reachable packages
    3. Removes any package directories not marked as reachable
    This includes support for workspace monorepos - all node_modules directories within a project (including those in workspace packages) are scanned.
  Patch Changes
  - Throw an error if the value of the tokenHelper or <url>:tokenHelper setting contains an environment variable.
  - Git dependencies with build scripts should respect the dangerouslyAllowAllBuilds settings #10376.
  - Skip the package manager check when running with --global and a project packageManager is configured, and warn that the check is skipped.
  - pnpm store prune should not fail if the dlx cache directory has files, not only directories #10384
  - Fixed a bug (#9759) where pnpm add would incorrectly modify a catalog entry in pnpm-workspace.yaml to its exact version.
