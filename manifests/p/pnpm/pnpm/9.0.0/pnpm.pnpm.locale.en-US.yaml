ReleaseNotes: |-
  Major Changes
  - Node.js v16 support discontinued
  - Configuration updates:
  - dedupe-injected-deps: enabled by default.
  - link-workspace-packages: disabled by default. This means that by default, dependencies will be linked from workspace packages only when they are specified using the workspace protocol.
  - hoist-workspace-packages: enabled by default.
  - enable-pre-post-scripts: enabled by default.
  - Use the same directory for state files on macOS as on Linux (~/.local/state/pnpm).
  - pnpm will now check the package.json file for a packageManager field.
    If this field is present and specifies a different package manager or a different version of pnpm than the one you're currently using, pnpm will not proceed.
    This ensures that you're always using the correct package manager and version that the project requires.
  - Lockfile changes:
  - Lockfile v9 is adopted.
    This new format has changes for better readability, and better resistence to Git conflicts.
  - Support for lockfile v5 is dropped.
    Use pnpm v8 to convert lockfile v5 to lockfile v6 #7470.
  - Dependency resolution changes:
  - Correct resolution of peer dependencies that have their own peer dependencies.
  - Optional peer dependencies may be resolved from any packages in the dependency graph #7830.
  - pnpm licenses list prints license information of all versions of the same package in case different versions use different licenses. The format of the pnpm licenses list --json output has been changed #7528.
  - A new command added for printing completion code to the console: pnpm completion [shell]. The old command that modified the user's shell dotfiles has been removed #3083.
  - When installing git-hosted dependencies, only pick the files that would be packed with the package #7638.
  Minor Changes
  - It is now possible to install only a subdirectory from a Git repository.
  - node-gyp updated to version 10.
  - PowerShell completion support added #7597.
  - Support node-options option inside .npmrc file when running scripts #7596.
  - Added support for registry-scoped SSL configurations (cert, key, and ca).
    Three new settings supported: <registryURL>:certfile, <registryURL>:keyfile, and <registryURL>:ca.
    For instance:
  - Add a field named ignoredOptionalDependencies.
    This is an array of strings.
    If an optional dependency has its name included in this array, it will be skipped #7714.
  - The checksum of the .pnpmfile.cjs is saved into the lockfile.
    If the pnpmfile gets modified, the lockfile is reanalyzed to apply the changes #7662.
  - Added cache for pnpm dlx #5277.
  Patch Changes
  - Package tarballs are not downloaded during --lockfile-only installation #1328.
  - Peer dependency rules should only affect reporting, not data in the lockfile #7758.
  - Link overrides should be able to use absolute path #7749.
  - pnpm dlx should not read settings from the current working directory #7916.
