ReleaseNotes: |-
  Minor Changes
  - The pnpm dlx / pnpx command now supports the catalog: protocol. Example: pnpm dlx shx@catalog:.
  - Support configuring auditLevel in the pnpm-workspace.yaml file #10540.
  - Support bare workspace: protocol without version specifier. It is now treated as workspace:* and resolves to the concrete version during publish #10436.
  Patch Changes
  - Fixed pnpm list --json returning incorrect paths when using global virtual store #10187.
  - Fix pnpm store path and pnpm store status using workspace root for path resolution when storeDir is relative #10290.
  - Fixed pnpm run -r failing with "No projects matched the filters" when an empty pnpm-workspace.yaml exists #10497.
  - Fixed a bug where catalogMode: strict would write the literal string "catalog:" to pnpm-workspace.yaml instead of the resolved version specifier when re-adding an existing catalog dependency #10176.
  - Fixed the documentation URL shown in pnpm completion --help to point to the correct page at https://pnpm.io/completion #10281.
  - Skip local file: protocol dependencies during pnpm fetch. This fixes an issue where pnpm fetch would fail in Docker builds when local directory dependencies were not available #10460.
  - Fixed pnpm audit --json to respect the --audit-level setting for both exit code and output filtering #10540.
  - update tar to version 7.5.7 to fix security issue
    Updating the version of dependency tar to 7.5.7 because the previous one have a security vulnerability reported here: CVE-2026-24842
  - Fix pnpm audit --fix replacing reference overrides (e.g. $foo) with concrete versions #10325.
  - Fix shamefullyHoist set via updateConfig in .pnpmfile.cjs not being converted to publicHoistPattern #10271.
  - pnpm help should correctly report if the currently running pnpm CLI is bundled with Node.js #10561.
  - Add a warning when the current directory contains the PATH delimiter character. On macOS, folder names containing forward slashes (/) appear as colons (:) at the Unix layer. Since colons are PATH separators in POSIX systems, this breaks PATH injection for node_modules/.bin, causing binaries to not be found when running commands like pnpm exec #10457.
