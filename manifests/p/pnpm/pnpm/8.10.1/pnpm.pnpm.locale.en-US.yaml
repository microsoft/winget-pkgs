ReleaseNotes: |-
  Patch Changes
  - (Important) Tarball resolutions in pnpm-lock.yaml will no longer contain a registry field.
    This field has been unused for a long time.
    This change should not cause any issues besides backward compatible modifications to the lockfile #7262.
  - Fix issue when trying to use pnpm dlx in the root of a Windows Drive #7263.
  - Optional dependencies that do not have to be built will be reflinked (or hardlinked) to the store instead of copied #7046.
  - If a package's tarball cannot be fetched, print the dependency chain that leads to the failed package #7265.
  - After upgrading one of our dependencies, we started to sometimes have an error on publish.
    We have forked @npmcli/arborist to patch it with a fix #7269.
