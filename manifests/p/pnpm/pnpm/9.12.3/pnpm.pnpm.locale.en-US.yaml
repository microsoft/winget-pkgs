  Patch Changes
  - Don't purge node_modules, when typing "n" in the prompt that asks whether to remove node_modules before installation #8655.
  - Fix a bug causing pnpm to infinitely spawn itself when manage-package-manager-versions=true is set and the .tools directory is corrupt.
  - Use crypto.hash, when available, for improved performance #8629.
  - Fixed a race condition in temporary file creation in the store by including worker thread ID in filename.
    Previously, multiple worker threads could attempt to use the same temporary file.
    Temporary files now include both process ID and thread ID for uniqueness #8703.
  - All commands should read settings from the package.json at the root of the workspace #8667.
  - When manage-package-manager-versions is set to true, errors spawning a self-managed version of pnpm will now be shown (instead of being silent).
  - Pass the find command to npm, it is an alias for npm search
