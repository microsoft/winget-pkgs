ReleaseNotes: |-
  Minor Changes
  - New commands added for inspecting the store:
  - pnpm cat-index: Prints the index file of a specific package in the store.
    The package is specified by its name and version: pnpm cat-index <pkg name>@<pkg version>
  - pnpm cat-file: Prints the contents of a file based on the hash value stored in the index file.
    For example:
  - pnpm find-hash: Lists the packages that include the file with the specified hash.
    For example:
  - A new setting added for symlinking injected dependencies from the workspace, if their dependencies use the same peer dependencies as the dependent package. The setting is called dedupe-injected-deps #7416.
  - Use --fail-if-no-match if you want the CLI fail if no packages were matched by the command #7403.
  Patch Changes
  - pnpm list --parseable should not print the same dependency multiple times #7429.
  - Fix error message texts in the pnpm env commands #7456.
  - Better support for light themed terminals by the pnpm update --interactive command #7439.
  - Fix EPERM error that occasionally happened on Windows during renames in the store #7213.
  - Fix error as in update -i -r with Git specifiers #7415.
  - Added support for boolean values in 'bundleDependencies' package.json fields when installing a dependency.
