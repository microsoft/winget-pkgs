  - Remove redundant parentheses in if guards for case blocks (#4214)
  - Add parentheses to if clauses in case blocks when the line is too long (#4269)

  The following changes were not in any previous release:

  - Collapse multiple empty lines after an import into one (#4489)
  - Prevent string_processing and wrap_long_dict_values_in_parens from removing
    parentheses around long dictionary values (#4377)
  - Move wrap_long_dict_values_in_parens from the unstable to preview style (#4561)
  Packaging
