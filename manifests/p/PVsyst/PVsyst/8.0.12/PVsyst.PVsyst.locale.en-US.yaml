ShortDescription: A PC software package for the study, sizing and data analysis of complete PV systems.
Description: |-
  PVsyst is a PC software package for the study, sizing and data analysis of complete PV systems.
  It deals with grid-connected, stand-alone, pumping and DC-grid (public transportation) PV systems, and includes extensive weather data and PV systems components databases, as well as general solar energy tools.
  This software is geared to the needs of architects, engineers, researchers. It is also very helpful for educational training.
  PVsyst focuses on complete and precise PV system study with a complete set of tools.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  * Improvements

  - Backtracking management tool: all tracker orientations are now displayed, including those in error
  - Bifacial: diffuse irradiance on the ground (DiffGnd) is now available for export
  - Bifacial: the bifacial performance ratio (PRBifi) now accounts for the bifaciality factor (*)
  - Bifacial: the default upper limit for the bifaciality factor has been increased to 98%
  - Databases update
  - Report: the bifacial performance ratio (PRBifi) is now displayed in the report and monthly tables (*)
  - Weather data: ability to choose the TGY data source when importing SolarAnywhere data (latest or 2023).

  * Corrections

  - 3D scene: negative values no longer appear in the "split" electrical shading tables when thin objects are present in the 3D scene
  - Bifacial: in mixed orientations subarrays, the rear mismatch losses now account for the mismatch factor from both orientations
  - General: an issue linked to remote file downloads no longer causes crashes
  - Grid storage, Weak grid islanding: the unused energy is now correctly accounted for when the grid is unavailable
  - Grid storage: buttons and values now update correctly when defining a self-consumption profile
  - Optimizers: minor update of the optimizers MPP choice under partial shadings with module layout shading model (*)
  - Orientation: cases where opposite azimuths were identified as the same orientation are now resolved
  - Report: importing a variant with valid results now keeps its related Site and Weather file names available to consult
  - Report: irradiance and Energy units defined in preferences are now used in the report
  - Report: predefined graph names are now properly translated
  - Report: the description of the medium voltage line is now correct
  - Weather data, Solargis: importing monthly data with a non-integer timezone (e.g., India with UTC+5:30) no longer causes crashes
  - Weather data, sub-hourly data import: looser verification whenever GHI average, min., max. are closer than 0.1 W/m²
  - Weather data, sub-hourly data import: the end of hour detection now works even when the time stamp does not include the year
  - Weather data, Vaisala: TMY import now manages GHI data correctly
  - Weather data: API-related issue no longer causes crashes
  - Weather data: importing empty csv files no longer causes crashes
  - Weather data: selecting variables for monthly weather data computation no longer causes crashes.
