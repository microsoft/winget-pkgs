ReleaseNotes: |-
  * Improvements

  - Databases update
  - Tutorial: new PDF tutorials were added: Step by step, "Standalone" and "Pumping".

  * Corrections

  - Module layout: fixed issue impacting intermediate results in cases where the PV array yields no power due to a combination of shadings and inverter operating constraints
  - Storage, power shifting: fixed issue triggering warning for energy balance error in  versions 8.0.18 and 8.0.19
  - Weather data: tables and graphs of variable "Global tilted plane" now properly account for the chosen albedo factor.
