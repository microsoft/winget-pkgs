ShortDescription: A PC software package for the study, sizing and data analysis of complete PV systems.
Description: |-
  PVsyst is a PC software package for the study, sizing and data analysis of complete PV systems.
  It deals with grid-connected, stand-alone, pumping and DC-grid (public transportation) PV systems, and includes extensive weather data and PV systems components databases, as well as general solar energy tools.
  This software is geared to the needs of architects, engineers, researchers. It is also very helpful for educational training.
  PVsyst focuses on complete and precise PV system study with a complete set of tools.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  * Improvements

  - Demo projects: new demo commercial project
  - Databases update
  - Economic evaluation: "Production variation (aging)" is renamed to "Module degradation" and now only positive values are allowed
  - Economic evaluation: optimizers are now handled in the installation costs
  - Optimizers, SolarEdge and Sungrow: database update
  - Power Factor: update and clarification of the help page
  - Report: grid limitation mode is now displayed when applied
  - Report: module PAN file name displayed when custom
  - System design: overload losses are now adjusted when a Power Factor is specified in "energy management" (*)
  - System Sizing: Warning messages for inverters slightly or strongly undersized are now triggering above 2% and 4% overload losses, respectively. These errors are not fatal anymore (*).

  * Corrections

  - 3D scene: the number of modules per table are now correctly computed when importing a H2P file
  - 3D scene: the bottom cell size is now taken into account also when computing the shading factor table from the Near shadings window (*)
  - 3D scene: display of the 3D scene works correctly with missing ground image and generating a report no longer causes crashes
  - 3D scene: shading factor tables calculation is now faster on large scenes
  - 3D scene: DAE/PVC files with complex objects are now imported faster
  - Bifacial: corrected calculation of the sky diffuse contribution on the rear side of the PV modules (*)
  - Bifacial: saving PRBifi no longer causes crashes
  - Detailed losses: dragging a point in the IAM curves no longer causes display issues
  - Detailed Results: the values of apparent and reactive energy in hourly graphs and monthly hourly table are now correct
  - Economic evaluation: corrected inconsistencies and display issues in the "Financial Parameters" section
  - Module layout: IV curves for non-relevant orientations are no longer shown
  - Optimizers: selecting modules with small Isc no longer causes crashes
  - Optimizers: minor corrections for AMPTstring optimizers
  - Orientation: azimuth limits are now properly enforced when using the visual tool to set table orientation
  - Shadings, diffuse: correction of diffuse shading loss calculation for low sun angles and average orientations
  - Self-consumption: daily hourly profile is now normalized and saved properly
  - System: when using power sharing, the contractual DC power limit of the inverter is now applied correctly.
