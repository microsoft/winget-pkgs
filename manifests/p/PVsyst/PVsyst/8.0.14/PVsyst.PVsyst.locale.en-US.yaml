ShortDescription: A PC software package for the study, sizing and data analysis of complete PV systems.
Description: |-
  PVsyst is a PC software package for the study, sizing and data analysis of complete PV systems.
  It deals with grid-connected, stand-alone, pumping and DC-grid (public transportation) PV systems, and includes extensive weather data and PV systems components databases, as well as general solar energy tools.
  This software is geared to the needs of architects, engineers, researchers. It is also very helpful for educational training.
  PVsyst focuses on complete and precise PV system study with a complete set of tools.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  * Improvements

  - 3D scene: GCR definition clarified in the help
  - Bifacial: all orientations with an error or warning are now reported
  - Bifacial: errors stemming from the irregularity of pitch or the average tracker axis are now warnings
  - Databases update.
  - Power Factor: The help pages and other explantations about the power factor have been rewritten and have been illustrated with graphics to clarify the concepts.
  - Shading: A message is now displayed upon exit of the 3D dialog when the Partial Shading Calc selection is less than 5% of the total area or less than 10 tables

  * Corrections

  - Backtracking: the number of trackers with a higher GCR is now recomputed upon changing the backtracking reference tracker
  - Bifacial: The calculation of the rear-side diffuse contribution for horizontal PV tables, and the corresponding loss diagram have been corrected (regression in V8.0.13)
  - Components, PAN file: the numerical value of Voc in the PV module definition window is no longer affected by numerical imprecision
  - Detailed Results: the absence of default variables for monthly plots no longer causes crashes
  - Shadings: "Print" output now processes all orientations
  - Shadings, thin objects: the partition model results in presence of thin objects have been corrected. This may impact the simulation results, by increasing the electrical shadings slightly in some cases (**).
  - Report: Fix for partial shading always reporting 100%
  - Report: the units of energy results are now correct
