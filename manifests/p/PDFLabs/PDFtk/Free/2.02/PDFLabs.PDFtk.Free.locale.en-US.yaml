ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Added drop_xmp output option for removing the document XMP metadata stream from a PDF.
  - Added dump_data output of custom page data embedded by STAMPtk tool. See the embed option in STAMPtk for more information.
  - Improved PDF bookmark merging logic so it can handle more input cases.
  - Fixed a password bug where some 'upper-ASCII' characters weren't being mapped to the correct code points.
  - Fixed a 40-bit decryption bug introduced in version 2.00.
  - Fixed a bug in the bookmark merging logic that caused bookmarks to be omitted from the merged PDF.

  - Organized our calls of JvInitClass() in main().
  - Added descriptions to some exception reports.
  - Reviewed some code from pdftk.cc, PdfReader.java, PdfWriter.java and friends.
