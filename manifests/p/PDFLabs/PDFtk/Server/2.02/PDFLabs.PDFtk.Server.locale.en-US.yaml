ReleaseNotes: |-

 o Added drop_xmp output option for removing the document XMP metadata stream from a PDF.
 o Added dump_data output of custom page data embedded by STAMPtk tool. See the embed option in STAMPtk for more information.
 o Improved PDF bookmark merging logic so it can handle more input cases.
 o Fixed a password bug where some 'upper-ASCII' characters weren't being mapped to the correct code points.
 o Fixed a 40-bit decryption bug introduced in version 2.00.
 o Fixed a bug in the bookmark merging logic that caused bookmarks to be omitted from the merged PDF.
 o Added a test to ensure that encryption passwords use permitted characters only. (Decryption attempts still allow a larger set of input characters.)
 o Rewrote the wide-to-utf8 code for Windows to make it more rigorous. 
 o Organized our calls of JvInitClass() in main().
 o Added descriptions to some exception reports. 
 o Reviewed some code from pdftk.cc, PdfReader.java, PdfWriter.java and friends.
