ReleaseNotes: |-
  The Pioneer development team is proud to announce the release of Pioneer 2026-02-03, our ninth annual "Pioneer Day" release! This past year was mostly spent on laying frameworks for new content to be created and improving old code - but that doesn't mean this release is devoid of new exciting features.
  This release touts an entirely new mission with 12 unique variations, major additions to the system and sector map interfaces, animated ship thrusters, gameplay changes to police and pirates, a completely new underlying economic simulation for station markets, the ability to bookmark systems and trade routes for later return, and more!
  We've also continued to improve our custom system editor, making it easier (and more bug-free) than ever before to create custom systems. We gladly welcome contributors interested in expanding the Pioneer universe with hand-crafted systems for the player to visit - feel free to stop by #pioneer on Libera.chat and discuss it with us!
  Animated Thruster Flames
  Thrusters are a static glow volume no longer; your ship has embraced chaos and now merrily spits a lively tongue of flame into the empty void of space!

  Planck Star Colors
  All stars in game now calculate their lighting based on a real-world spectral formula, yielding much more believable lighting based on star temperature. We've attached a development comparison here so you can see the effects:

  User Interface
  The map interfaces have received some polish and new features. Both map screens now follow a common layout, with sidebars containing information panels and options, with navigation controls available in a centralized toolbar at the bottom.
  A headlining new feature is the ability to bookmark systems, and (with a trade computer) commodity trading routes between the current station and a destination. These bookmarks can have custom notes attached, so you will always be able to remember which system you were waylaid by pirates in.
  Speaking of pirates, the new layout for system information displays a "security rating" for the targeted system. While you're never guaranteed to be attacked (or safe) in a system, you'd do well to minimize time spent in high-risk systems unless you're spoiling for a fight. You can now also view the extended description for a system - if a contributor has written one. Pssst... you could write one yourself and contribute it to the game!

  For those pilots not looking to take in the sights, the sector map now has the ability to trigger a legal hyperjump directly from the map screen via a button on the toolbar. This pairs nicely with the gameplay setting to leave the map screen open during a hyperjump!
  The system map now shows information about a ship or hypercloud target, if a Target Scanner or Hypercloud Analyzer is installed on the ship.

  The HUD now displays this target information in a similar way as well. And the target context menu now provides a way to set your hyperspace destination to the other "end" of a hypercloud if an analyzer is installed.

  Police and Pirates
  Have you ever found yourself running afoul of the law because you fired your weapons at the wrong time? Station police now have a much more generous threshold before they attempt to shoot you down and take you in the old-fashioned way. You'll still be fined for shooting in a no-fire zone, so be careful!
  Pirates have become much sneakier. Instead of hanging out right next to your arrival cloud to ambush your ship as it comes out of hyperspace, they will loiter around planets in the target system, burning to intercept you and steal all your valuables as you approach.
  Finding people
  A new mission type is introduced, where the player is tasked with finding a person and either bringing them back, or to deliver a message to them.

  Economy Changes
  The economic simulation that determines commodity prices and availability at a station has undergone a major rewrite. Starports now determine their commodity market based on a randomized set of industries in operation at that starport. Industries consume goods to produce other goods, meaning that if you find a starport producing a lot of ore, they will likely need mining machinery to keep producing that ore.
  Starports also participate in a "local network" of trade, shuffling goods back and forth between starports orbiting the same major body. If they need a commodity that isn't produced in sufficient quantity within this local network, they'll be willing to pay higher prices to enterprising players willing to sell it to them (and inversely for buying commodities).
  This information is currently only visible via the Ctrl+I debug menu, but we hope to make it visible to players during the next release cycle.
  About menu
  Pioneer now has an in-game about menu containing lots of useful information about the project and where to find help. We hope this will guide curious players seeking information on how to contribute.
