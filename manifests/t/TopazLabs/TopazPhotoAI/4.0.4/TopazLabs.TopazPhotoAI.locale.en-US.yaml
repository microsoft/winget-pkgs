ReleaseNotes: |-
  Hello! This patch brings small changes in preparation for our transition to the new applications that will be released soon.Photo AI will continue to receive occasional minor patch updates for compatibility. New AI models and major features will be introduced in the Studio versions of our desktop apps.
  As you may have seen in recent emails and discussions, we are launching a new application built from Photo AI and updating the license structure for this new application. These changes are made with the longevity and growth of the company in mind so we can hopefully develop more exciting models and features for all users who we are lucky to be building for.
  We understand that many of you have questions and concerns about the transition which we will do our best to answer. Please join the conversation and share your thoughts about the change here. Your feedback helps us build responsibly and thoughtfully, and we’re deeply grateful for your continued support.
