ShortDescription: Analyze fire control and smoke dissipation in various structures for fire protection and safety or investigation.
Description: |-
  PyroSim was designed to complement the Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) developed by NIST in the US. With state-of-the-art fire research facilities and personnel, they understand the calculations of fire simulation better than anyone.
  FDS is the engine powering fire simulations all over the world. PyroSim empowers more engineers to use this technology and elevates its capabilities.
  1. PyroSim provides graphical tools which automatically generate the text-only FDS input file.
  2. PyroSim imports CAD, enables advanced simulation management, and packages its own results manager.
  None of this is possible without FDS empowering car park jet fan simulations, sprinkler activation studies, and more.
  FDS is free for anyone to download. Do you need PyroSim? We think so. Consider the time not spent constructing your building geometry from scratch in a text editor. Consider the errors caught in real-time and brought to your attention.
  Thunderhead Engineering supports you every step of the way. Whether you want in-depth training or self-taught materials, you can learn performance-based design modeling with greater efficiency and proficiency. We design our software for anyone to learn, and our customers are delighted when our support team helps them succeed.
ReleaseNotes: |-
  User Experience Improvements
  PyroSim 2026.1 delivers meaningful user experience and stability improvements aimed at creating a smoother, more efficient modeling workflow. Expanded support for additional keyboard shortcuts helps users work faster and more intuitively, while updated warnings provide clearer feedback during model setup. Stability has been improved during scenario creation, reducing interruptions in complex projects, and major OpenGL updates have enhanced rendering stability, resulting in more reliable and consistent visualization performance.
  Results Changes
  Results handling in the new PyroSim release has been enhanced to better support common analysis workflows and reduce manual setup. 3D Smoke results are now automatically activated when available, allowing users to immediately visualize smoke behavior without additional configuration. In addition, CSV results data can now be auto-loaded, streamlining access to numerical output and making it easier to review, plot, and post-process simulation results directly after a run completes.
  You can read more about the changes to Results in the Results Documentation.
  Documentation Improvements
  The 2026.1 release includes a major overhaul of the product documentation, focused on making information easier and faster to access. Navigation has been significantly improved through the introduction of pagination, allowing users to move more quickly between sections, while a new document-wide search tool makes it easier to find specific topics and answers. Pages that are new or have been updated are now clearly highlighted, helping users quickly identify what has changed in the latest release.
  In addition, previously separate manuals and content have been consolidated into a single, unified document, reducing fragmentation and simplifying the learning experience. The documentation has also been reorganized to improve the discoverability of related content, making it easier for both new and experienced users to explore features, understand workflows, and find relevant guidance without unnecessary searching.
  Explore the updated documentation by trying the new search tool located at the top of the documentation table of contents, which provides a quick way to jump directly to relevant information. Be sure to review the Examples section (formerly Tutorials) for practical, step-by-step guidance, visit Troubleshooting (previously FAQs) for help resolving common issues, and explore the Advanced Topics and Appendices for deeper technical detail and reference material that support more complex use cases.
  Streamlined Introduction for New Users
  This release introduces a streamlined Introduction and Fundamentals documentation experience designed to help new users get up and running more quickly. The updated materials present core concepts, workflows, and interface elements in a clearer, more focused structure, reducing the learning curve for first-time users. By emphasizing practical fundamentals and approachable explanations, the new documentation makes it easier for users to build confidence and begin creating effective fire modeling projects in PyroSim.
