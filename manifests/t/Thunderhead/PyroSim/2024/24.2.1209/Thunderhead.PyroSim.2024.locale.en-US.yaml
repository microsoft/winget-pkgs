ShortDescription: Analyze fire control and smoke dissipation in various structures for fire protection and safety or investigation.
Description: |-
  PyroSim was designed to complement the Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) developed by NIST in the US. With state-of-the-art fire research facilities and personnel, they understand the calculations of fire simulation better than anyone.
  FDS is the engine powering fire simulations all over the world. PyroSim empowers more engineers to use this technology and elevates its capabilities.
  1. PyroSim provides graphical tools which automatically generate the text-only FDS input file.
  2. PyroSim imports CAD, enables advanced simulation management, and packages its own results manager.
  None of this is possible without FDS empowering car park jet fan simulations, sprinkler activation studies, and more.
  FDS is free for anyone to download. Do you need PyroSim? We think so. Consider the time not spent constructing your building geometry from scratch in a text editor. Consider the errors caught in real-time and brought to your attention.
  Thunderhead Engineering supports you every step of the way. Whether you want in-depth training or self-taught materials, you can learn performance-based design modeling with greater efficiency and proficiency. We design our software for anyone to learn, and our customers are delighted when our support team helps them succeed.
