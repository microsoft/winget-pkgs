ShortDescription: Simulate pedestrian evacuation and general crowd movement in stadiums, hospitals, skyscrapers, public transit, and more.
Description: |-
  Pathfinder delivers agent-based simulation through an intuitive interface to output clear and detailed results.
  Each occupant in a Pathfinder model is aware of their surroundings and constantly recalculates their next step based on present information. These decisions are informed by academic research and validation testing. This process allows the Pathfinder simulation engine to model realistic human behavior.
  1. Thunderhead Engineering partners with leading researchers and hosts premier events to promote further development of pedestrian movement understanding.
  2. We validate and publish our own tests of Pathfinder against research data to ensure our tool can be trusted.
  Pathfinder scales to the size and complexity of your project. Simple experiments can be setup in minutes. Pathfinder also pushes past the limits of other tools with Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis, smoke contaminant exposure, social distance modeling, and more.
  Thunderhead Engineering supports you every step of the way. Whether you want in-depth training or self-taught materials, you can learn performance-based design modeling with greater efficiency and proficiency. We design our software for anyone to learn, and our customers are delighted when our support team helps them succeed.
