ShortDescription: Simulate pedestrian evacuation and general crowd movement in stadiums, hospitals, skyscrapers, public transit, and more.
Description: |-
  Pathfinder delivers agent-based simulation through an intuitive interface to output clear and detailed results.
  Each occupant in a Pathfinder model is aware of their surroundings and constantly recalculates their next step based on present information. These decisions are informed by academic research and validation testing. This process allows the Pathfinder simulation engine to model realistic human behavior.
  1. Thunderhead Engineering partners with leading researchers and hosts premier events to promote further development of pedestrian movement understanding.
  2. We validate and publish our own tests of Pathfinder against research data to ensure our tool can be trusted.
  Pathfinder scales to the size and complexity of your project. Simple experiments can be setup in minutes. Pathfinder also pushes past the limits of other tools with Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis, smoke contaminant exposure, social distance modeling, and more.
  Thunderhead Engineering supports you every step of the way. Whether you want in-depth training or self-taught materials, you can learn performance-based design modeling with greater efficiency and proficiency. We design our software for anyone to learn, and our customers are delighted when our support team helps them succeed.
ReleaseNotes: |-
  What's New
  This release adds a lot of improvements for Scenario based workflows, alongside a flurry of User Experience Improvements.
  This version of Pathfinder uses version 21.0.2+13 of the OpenJDK Java VM.
  Monte Carlo UI
  Pathfinder's old Monte Carlo utility has now been moved in to the Pathfinder User Interface. Creating tens, hundreds, or even thousands of variations of your movement models, complete with randomizations of Occupant positions, Profiles, and Properties, has never been easier. The new Monte Carlo Parameters UI allows you to easily control all of these variables. Monte Carlo variations are also created for each Scenario in the model, making it even easier to analyze Occupant behavior in your movement space.
  Create multiple randomized variations using the Monte Carlo Paramters dialog.
  Running these variations is also seamless. Any variations specified in the Monte Carlo Parameters dialog are run automatically when you click Run Simulation.
  Run multiple Monte Carlo variations with the click of a button.
  You can read about these changes in the Monte Carlo chapter of the Pathfinder User Manual.
  Pathfinder 2025.1 also includes changes to Results that make viewing the Results of multiple Monte Carlo variations much easier. See more about those changes in Scenarios and Variations Support.
  Improved Scenarios
  This release makes Scenarios even easier to set up. Prior releases of Pathfinder required that you select Object properties to customize using the Scenario Setup dialog. This is still present, however Pathfinder 2025.1 streamlines this process by allowing you to control the customization of Object properties by shift-clicking them with a Scenario active.
  Shift-clicking to enable/disable object property customization in a Scenario.
  This feature makes setting up your Scenarios even more of a breeze. You can read about these changes in the Customizing Property Shortcuts section of the Pathfinder User Manual.
  Pathfinder 2025.1 also includes changes to Results that make viewing the Results of multiple Scenarios much easier. See more about those changes in Scenarios and Variations Support.
  User Experience Improvements
  Pathfinder 2025.1 also contains a long list of other User Experience improvements.
  PDFs as Background Images
  PDF files can now be imported for use when drawing your Pathfinder geometry. The process to import these files is the same as for importing Background Images. PDF files can be scaled, moved, and drawn on using the same techniques you are already familiar with.
  Importing a PDF file as a Background Image in Pathfinder.
  See the Generating Geometry from PDF Files section of the Pathfinder User Manual for more information.
  Dimension Label when drawing
  Drawing tools in Pathfinder now take some calculation burden off of your hands with a simple but powerful change in this release. They now display a dimension label whenever the tool is active, showing the length of any lines that they draw. This is particularly useful when free-drawing geometry, helping you ensure that you are staying accurate in your dimensions.

  See the Tool Dimension Labels section of the Pathfinder User Manual for more information.
  Geometry Vertex Delete
  In prior versions of Pathfinder, working with geometry created from imported BIM data could prove difficult because of the large number of vertices present in the geometry. This was particularly evident with larger rooms. Cleaning and modifying this geometry is made easier with Pathfinder 2025.1 and the ability to delete individual geometry vertices.

  The ability to delete and modify these vertices directly will result in cleaner, more accurate geometry in your models. See the Removing a Handle section of the Pathfinder User Manual for more information.
  Find by Tag
  Previous versions of Pathfinder introduced Object Tagging, a useful method for identifying and organizing objects with common characteristics. Pathfinder 2025.1 expands on the utility of Tags via improvements to the Find dialog. The updated dialog now has the ability to find Objects in the model based on their associated tags.

  See the Find Objects with a Shared Tag section of the Pathfinder User Manual for more information.
  Results
  FED and Visibility Post Processing
  Results 2025.1 introduces two powerful post-processing options when working with Pathfinder and PyroSim results data in the same visualization.
  Fraction Effective Dose (FED) Post Processing
  While Pathfinder still incorporates the ability to couple Pathfinder and PyroSim simulations for the purposes of FED calculation, Results 2025.1 now provides the ability to perform this same calculation, without the need to couple two simulation together. When Occupants of a Pathfinder simulation move through a movement space that contains the necessary data from a PyroSim simulation, Results can calculate the Fractional Effective Dose (FED) of smoke irritants that Occupants are exposed to. This data can be evaluated by either plotting the 2D data, or coloring Occupants by their level of exposure.

  Coloring Occupants by FED data in Results 2025.1
  See the Calculating Fractional Effective Dose section of the Results User Manual for more information.
  Visibility Post Processing
  Similar to FED calculations, Results now provides the ability to perform Occupant visibility calculations through smoke. When Occupants of a Pathfinder simulation move through a movement space that contains the necessary visibility data from a PyroSim simulation, Results uses the Occupantâ€™s location, orientation, and the FDS visibility data to calculate two different Visibility values for Occupants. This data can be evaluated by either plotting the 2D data, or coloring Occupants by their available visibility.

  See the Calculating Occupant Visibility through Smoke section of the Results User Manual for more information.
  Scenarios and Variations Support
  Results 2025.1 provides a powerful new utility when working with multiple Scenario or Monte Carlo variation datasets. Previous versions required that the user keep track of the different results files generated by their models, then manually load them either one at a time, or in different Results windows. The Variation Switcher in Results 2025.1 makes the process of checking these different files much simpler. Simply select the desired Variation in the dropdown and Results will load the files and display the data for you.
  Switching between Monte Carlo variations in Results 2025.1
  See the Switching Between Variation Data Sets section of the Results User Manual for more information.
