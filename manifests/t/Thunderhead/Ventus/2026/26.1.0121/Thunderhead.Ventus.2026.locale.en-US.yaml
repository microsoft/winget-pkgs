ShortDescription: Build fast Pressure Zone models for buildings, including stairwells, shafts, atriums and underground facilities.
Description: |-
  Ventus is developed by a team of experienced engineers and software developers to address the specific needs of building safety engineers. Ventus helps you design air handling systems for the crucial work of managing airflow and preventing the spread of contaminants during emergency scenarios inside of your building spaces.
  By strategically managing airflow, the systems you design will be able to maintain tenable conditions in critical Escape Routes, including Stairwells, Shafts, Atria, and Underground Facilities.
  With your system designs, Occupants will be able to avoid a cascade of hazards from obscured visibility that hinders evacuation efforts, to respiratory distress and incapacitation.
  Ventus leverages the power of CONTAM to provide you the insights necessary to perfect your system designs. With the streamlined user experience, visualization and communication tools, and detailed analysis available in Ventus, you can cut 30-50% off the time spent on your airflow control analysis projects, freeing up valuable resources and accelerating project timelines.
ReleaseNotes: |-
  HVAC Support
  Ventus 2026.1 introduces preliminary support for modeling more complex HVAC duct systems, expanding the product’s capabilities for detailed airflow analysis. Users can now create Duct Junctions, Duct Segments, and Duct Flow Elements to represent realistic duct layouts, while results at Duct Junctions can be visualized directly in the 3D workspace as vector data. This new functionality allows for more intuitive inspection of airflow direction and magnitude, helping engineers design, analyze, and optimize HVAC systems with greater confidence.

  You can read more about Ducts in the Ducts section of the Ventus Documentation.
  Additional Flow Element Support
  Ventus also introduces support for several new flow element types, providing more precise options for modeling airflow and leakages. The Crack Description element allows users to simulate leakages using measured door crack dimensions, making it easier to represent real-world gaps and penetrations. Test Data (1-Point) and Test Data (2-Point) elements enable modeling of leakages based on empirical test data for well-studied building components, improving accuracy for validated scenarios. Additionally, the Darcy-Colebrook flow model has been added for duct flow elements, offering a more sophisticated method for simulating duct systems.
  You can read more about the new Flow Elements in the Powerlaw Models and Duct Flow Elements sections of the Ventus Documentation.
  User Experience Improvements
  The latest Ventus release includes several user experience and stability improvements aimed at making the software more reliable and intuitive. The user interface has been clarified to reduce confusion and streamline workflows, while underlying CONTAM updates enhance simulation accuracy and compatibility. Numerous bug fixes have resolved known issues, and major OpenGL updates improve rendering stability, providing smoother and more consistent visualization of models and results.
  Documentation Improvements
  The 2026.1 release includes a major overhaul of the product documentation, focused on making information easier and faster to access. Navigation has been significantly improved through the introduction of pagination, allowing users to move more quickly between sections, while a new document-wide search tool makes it easier to find specific topics and answers. Pages that are new or have been updated are now clearly highlighted, helping users quickly identify what has changed in the latest release.
  In addition, previously separate manuals and content have been consolidated into a single, unified document, reducing fragmentation and simplifying the learning experience. The documentation has also been reorganized to improve the discoverability of related content, making it easier for both new and experienced users to explore features, understand workflows, and find relevant guidance without unnecessary searching.
  Explore the updated documentation by trying the new search tool located at the top of the documentation table of contents, which provides a quick way to jump directly to relevant information. Be sure to review the Examples section (formerly Tutorials) for practical, step-by-step guidance, visit Troubleshooting (previously FAQs) for help resolving common issues, and explore the Advanced Topics and Appendices for deeper technical detail and reference material that support more complex use cases.
