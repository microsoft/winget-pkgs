ShortDescription: Build fast Pressure Zone models for buildings, including stairwells, shafts, atriums and underground facilities.
Description: |-
  Ventus is developed by a team of experienced engineers and software developers to address the specific needs of building safety engineers. Ventus helps you design air handling systems for the crucial work of managing airflow and preventing the spread of contaminants during emergency scenarios inside of your building spaces.
  By strategically managing airflow, the systems you design will be able to maintain tenable conditions in critical Escape Routes, including Stairwells, Shafts, Atria, and Underground Facilities.
  With your system designs, Occupants will be able to avoid a cascade of hazards from obscured visibility that hinders evacuation efforts, to respiratory distress and incapacitation.
  Ventus leverages the power of CONTAM to provide you the insights necessary to perfect your system designs. With the streamlined user experience, visualization and communication tools, and detailed analysis available in Ventus, you can cut 30-50% off the time spent on your airflow control analysis projects, freeing up valuable resources and accelerating project timelines.
