ShortDescription: Build fast Pressure Zone models for buildings, including stairwells, shafts, atriums and underground facilities.
Description: |-
  Ventus is developed by a team of experienced engineers and software developers to address the specific needs of building safety engineers. Ventus helps you design air handling systems for the crucial work of managing airflow and preventing the spread of contaminants during emergency scenarios inside of your building spaces.
  By strategically managing airflow, the systems you design will be able to maintain tenable conditions in critical Escape Routes, including Stairwells, Shafts, Atria, and Underground Facilities.
  With your system designs, Occupants will be able to avoid a cascade of hazards from obscured visibility that hinders evacuation efforts, to respiratory distress and incapacitation.
  Ventus leverages the power of CONTAM to provide you the insights necessary to perfect your system designs. With the streamlined user experience, visualization and communication tools, and detailed analysis available in Ventus, you can cut 30-50% off the time spent on your airflow control analysis projects, freeing up valuable resources and accelerating project timelines.
ReleaseNotes: |-
  What's New
  This release adds further support for CONTAM features, alongside a flurry of User Experience Improvements.
  This version of Ventus is designed for CONTAM version 3.4.0.6 and uses version 21.0.2+13 of the OpenJDK Java VM.
  Additional Flow Element Support
  Continuing with our mission of supporting CONTAM features, Ventus 2025.1 adds support for several new Fan and Forced Flow, Cubic Spline, and Two-way Flow Flow Elements. These non-Powerlaw Model Flow Elements are powerful tools to model relationships between pressure drop and mass flow.
  Example results of one performance curve type Flow Path.
  These new elements enable Ventus to model a broader range of airflow scenarios. New Fan Elements allow for modeling of different types of constant flow fans, the Performance Curve Flow Element allows for modeling of variable speed fan devices, and the new Two-Way Flow Elements allow for higher fidelity modeling of large openings. See the Flow Elements section of the Ventus User Manual for details about these new Flow Elements. You can also view the new Fan and Forced Flow tutorial for hands-on learning with some of these elements.
  New Find Advanced search
  In previous versions of Ventus, objects could be difficult to find in large models. Ventus 2025.1 introduces the Find Advanced search dialog, allowing searches for objects with specific properties.
  The new Find Advanced Search is modeless, allowing users to edit the model while the search dialog is active. Any edits to object properties immediately updates the search results dialog.
  Example usage of the *Find Advanced* Search Dialog: A search for a Flow Element with a Powerlaw Model of Leakage Area and an Area per Unit Area greater than 0.
  Zone Volume manual override
  Previous versions of Ventus automatically calculated Zone Volume based on the geometric bounds of the Zone. While this calculation is still performed, it can be overridden for special use-cases involving non-orthogonal space, such as when modeling the attic space under a gable roof. Your Ventus models can now be modeled with higher fidelity thanks to this new feature.

  User Experience Improvements
  User Experience Improvements are a key focus in this Ventus update.
  PDFs as Background Images
  PDF files can now be imported for use when drawing your Ventus geometry. The process to import these files is the same as for importing Background Images. PDF files can be scaled, moved, and drawn on using the same techniques you are already familiar with.

  See the Creating Geometry with PDF Files section of the Ventus User Manual for more information.
  New Object Labels in the workspace
  This release features Flow Path name labels visible in the 3D Workspace and a LBL filter button to toggle their display. User preferences for color, opacity, and font size of these labels can be configured in the Preferences menu.

  Flow Path Resilience
  Ventus 2025.1 greatly improves the resilience of Flow Paths.
  - Flow Path endpoints can now be manipulated with the selection tool. This allows easy fixing of broken connections and manual adjustment of Flow Paths.
  - Flow Path connections to Zones in ambiguous cases are now detected better, such as when a Flow Path is on a corner between two Zones.
  - Flow Path Copy/Paste now detects connections and direction much better.
  Example modification to a Flow Path in this version of Ventus
  Improved Selection by Level
  Ventus 2025.1 introduces a new Select within Level context submenu that allows for easy selection of Objects, or types of Objects, contained within a Level.
  Select within level.
  Flow Path marker size option
  Flow Path marker sizes can now be modified to make certain Flow Paths more visible.
  Varied Flow Path marker size
