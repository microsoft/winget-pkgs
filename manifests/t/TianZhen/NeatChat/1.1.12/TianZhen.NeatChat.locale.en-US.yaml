ShortDescription: 'NeatChat: A simplified and optimized fork of NextChat'
Description: |-
  NeatChat is a new version of NextChat with a number of optimizations. NeatChat currently has three branches: main, mini and preview.
  The preview branch is the preview version of the main branch, which will be merged into the main branch when it stabilizes, and the mini branch is a separate simplified version (for the mini branch, go to NeatChat-Mini).
  The main branch's mission is to optimize the UI and add features so that it can grow independently of NextChat, while the mini branch will be fine-tuned and trimmed down from NextChat to keep up with NextChat, with only the most important features from the main branch going down to the mini branch. Since the main branch and the mini branch have different purposes, they will also have two UIs.
