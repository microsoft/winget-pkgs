  What's new in TextExpander 8.4
  New Feature: Date Picker
  Date Picker lets you quickly choose the exact date you need—past, present, or future—right from a calendar and insert it directly into a Snippet as it expands. No more flipping between apps or typing dates by hand.
  It’s perfect for:
  - Scheduling appointments and follow-ups
  - Referencing deadlines or due dates
  - Communicating timelines or reminders
  - Inserting dates of birth or submission dates
  Fixes & Improvements:
  - Improved sync reliability: Updates now sync seamlessly without needing to log out and back in.
  - Snippet group sync: Fixed rare issues with renamed or deleted snippet groups not syncing correctly across devices.
