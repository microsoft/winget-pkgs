ShortDescription: NegativeEncoder is a GUI tool for video encoding using QuickSync and NVENC.
Description: |-
  "Negative encoding" is an encoding method that saves system resources to the greatest extent and speeds up encoding. Sometimes video quality is not the main factor, so why not go "negative" instead of "positively" doing an elaborate encoding? This software calls hardware-accelerated encoding (e.g. NVENC), which is a very effective method. Although it is often said that the quality of the generated video is not as good as x264, it is sufficient in most cases, isn't it?
