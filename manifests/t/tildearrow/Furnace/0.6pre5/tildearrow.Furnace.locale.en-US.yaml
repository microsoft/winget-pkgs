ShortDescription: a multi-system chiptune tracker compatible with DefleMask modules
ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Casio PV-1000 chip
  - ZX Spectrum QuadTone engine
  - folders for ins/wave/sample lists
  - smaller .fur files thanks to a new pattern format
  - finally, sample map with pitchable notes and a new UI for it
  - several sample editor improvements
  the huge, boring changelog
  - added missing intro tune credits (A M 4 N)
  - fix terminal window showing up on Windows 11 (finally... thanks dj.tuBIG/MaliceX!)
  - sadly this change makes console mode difficult to use. yeah, Windows limitation...
  - fix panning effect in OPZ
  - a new ZX Spectrum beeper engine:
    QuadTone! (by Natt Akuma)
  - make some chips (NES, SM8521 and Game Boy) more deterministic
  - fix randomize not being really random
  - SegaPCM fixes:
  - fix sample loop
  - fix possible crash
  - fix linear slides being inconsistent with other chips
  - fix a few issues with SNES (mostly regarding BRR samples)
  - a new chip: Casio PV-1000! (thanks cam900)
  - change Commander X16 mixing to match latest revision of hardware
  - fix several issues in the Orders window
  - SN76489 now has a register view
  - Namco C30 improvements:
  - better noise strategy
  - add a noise macro
  - Namco WSG/C15 ROM mode
  - when enabled, this limits you to 8 wavetables and no wave synth
  - designed for those who want to play around and try getting it to run on a real board
  - revamped Amiga emulation - now with a working register view and actual sample memory limits
  - removed some excessive Namco 163 macros (the WaveLoad ones)
  - built-in file picker fixes:
  - "/" no longer appears in the file name input box
  - .. (go to parent directory) is now a button (fixes a sorting issue)
  - fix occasional path resets
  - color Future Composer files
  - prepare a ROM export framework so it becomes easier to work on it for 0.7
  - remember the state of extra channel buttons (that ++ thing)
  - add a disclaimer when exporting AY-3-8914 VGMs
  - not well-supported on VGMPlay
  - this doesn't affect other AY variants
  - fix panning in RF5C68 after jumping to an order
  - fix weird waveform on first note on in Namco 163
  - fix YMF276 emulation (clipping)
  - PCM DAC fixes:
  - muting fix
  - interpolation improvements (especially when playing samples backwards)
  - wave interpolation
  - C64 macro mode usability fix (macro zoom resets when changing macro modes)
  - VIC-20 improvements/fixes:
  - new "on/off" macro
  - fix macro issues with volume
  - added an FM preview
  - for now this feature is exclusive to the OPN instrument type
  - enable it by right-clicking in the algorithm preview
  - implement real-time playback needles in the sample editor
  - not all chips are supported but most are
  - fix sample editor needles getting stuck to the sides when zooming
  - fix possibility of escaping orders when undoing
  - fix some chips not having custom clocks
  - MIDI output improvements:
  - press Stop twice to send MIDI panic
  - follow mute state of channels
  - add "send program change" option
  - MIDI timecode generation and MIDI clock improvements
  - you can now change the position of the buttons in the Orders window
  - finally implement sample maps with note pitching!
  - including a new, easier to use sample map UI
  - add a keybind for New
  - improve config system - never lose a config file again
  - by employing redundancy and several checks, Furnace is ready even if a config file becomes corrupted
  - thanks Lolwe!
  - log rotation - keeps the 5 last log files in the config dir
  - new backup system
  - previously there was a single backup.fur file in the config dir
  - now Furnace is able to save a couple backup files per song
  - fix 1.1.7-1.1.9 .dmf loading
  - it appears sample pitch/start/end worked differently
  - fix a visual glitch in the per-channel oscilloscope and channel volume meters when playing the song
  - new Commander X16 presets for possible future changes in the hardware specification
  - including a Twin OPL3 preset just in case the YM2151 supply issues cannot be solved
  - fix K007232 stereo setting
  - fix "Oscilloscope goes out of bounds" showing the waveform on top of everything
  - fix OPN Extended Channel muting
  - fix MIDI note hang when switching windows while a key is pressed
  - fix a possible crash when using the system file picker on Windows
  - prevent Settings window from being impossible to close at times
  - clarified the VGM export loop trail setting
  - fix missing ADPCM channel oscilloscope in Y8950
  - make the per-chan osc of X1-010 louder
  - many documentation updates
  - fix EDxx when using one-tick gap compat flag
  - fix crash when resampling an 8-bit sample using BLEP synthesis
  - fix some sliders not being right-clickable
  - vertical sliders are now right-clickable
  - VGM export now writes Hz value when possible
  - add options to collapse/expand the pattern and/or song
  - and it's super fast
  - fix AY-3-8910 per-chan osc being weird at times
  - greatly optimize the sample editor for long samples
  - allow pulling selection start/end points in sample editor
  - implement rarely-used 05xy/06xy effects
  - since Furnace supports multiple effect columns, these effects are redundant
  - but DefleMask implemented those, so for compatibility I had to do it
  - wave synth improvements:
  - option to pause preview
  - option to copy current preview to a new wavetable
  - added option to save sample as raw data
  - prevent unreadable text when fonts fail to load
  - Game Boy technical fixes
  - wave is no longer offset by 1
  - new option to toggle inverting the wave
  - SNES global volume control effects
  - fix tall .dmw loading
  - NES changes:
  - sample mode is now DPCM by default
  - 20xx effect to change DPCM pitch
  - another effect to change triangle linear counter
  - fix broken macro after note off in some FM chips
  - finally implement SSG PCM in OPN chips
  - fix out of range effect value crash
  - resampling a sample now uses rate instead of compat rate
  - folders for instruments/waves/samples
  - arbitrary organization of these
  - added an option to disable .fur compression
  - new packed pattern format - big savings in uncompressed files
  - add -subsong command line parameter
  - fix glitchy sound in C64 when more than one channel is changing filter cutoff (#1114)
  - fix QSound glitch when playing song (#1127)
  - fix Sunsoft 5B per-chan osc (kinda)
  - improve sample editor delete/trim when loop is present
  - prevent exit from being clicked by accident when going to file > configure chip
  - improve sample type conversion in sample editor
  - fix arpeggios not working after using E0xx and saving
  note for Windows users
  - this release fixes a terminal window opening in Windows 11.
  - as stated in the previous release notes, only use the 32-bit build if you are absolutely certain you need it. otherwise, you don't. get the 64-bit release instead!
