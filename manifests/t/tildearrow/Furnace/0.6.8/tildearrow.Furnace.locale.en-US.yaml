ReleaseNotes: |-
  it's been a while since 0.6.7...
  this is (hopefully) the final release in the 0.6 series. 0.7 development will begin very soon.
  change log
  - add Watara Supervision system
    - a rather obscure console from Taiwan with two pulse channels, a noise and primitive sample channel
  - add SID3 fantasy chip
    - inspired by SID, this chip has 6 channels of analog-synth-like goodness, a boatload of macros and even one wave channel
  - add OPL4 system
    - OPL3 with 24 sample channels taken from the to-be-implemented MultiPCM
  - fix 5E01 not producing sound at all
  - SNES anti-click
    - note that this does not eliminate clicks in samples with incompatible loop regions! it only applies to note playback.
  - POKEY SAP type R export (playable by Altirra and lzss-sap on hardware)
  - FamiTracker import improvements
    - create instrument copies to represent what FamiTracker does (in particular, on VRC6 channels when using 2A03 instruments)
    - fix Hxy effect for S5B (AY)
    - fix virtual tempo going outside range
    - fix VRC7 patch switch effect (Dn-FamiTracker) not being imported correctly
  - find/replace improvements
    - make the note selector a bit more comfortable
    - search in selection now works on selected channels only (previously it would search on all channels... issue #2393)
    - fix a possible crash (issue #2328)
    - cut/delay policy is now lax
    - set macro release mode to Active (issue #2376)
  - C64 4-bit PCM/digi (using volume control)
  - performance optimizations for certain chips
    - up to 10 times less CPU usage during playback and faster audio exports
    - optimized chips include: PC Speaker, GA20, Amiga, PC Engine, SCC, NES, MMC5, VRC6, TIA, Virtual Boy, AY (not so much), Nintendo DS, T6W28, SN, SM8521, Bubble System WSG and K007232
  - new WonderSwan emulation core courtesy of asiekierka (#2401)
  - Virtual Boy changes
    - one notorious Virtual Boy quirk is that you cannot write to wave/modulation table memory unless all channels are disabled
    - Furnace wasn't taking this quirk into account, which means that exported VGMs wouldn't play on hardware
    - this release makes exported VGMs work on hardware by disabling all channels on wave change
    - however, this means there will be a "click" on every wave change, which can get very annoying
    - it is recommended you use static mode, or change waves sparingly...
    - there's a setting to go back to the old behavior, but keep in mind this will break VGM export and is not hardware-accurate!
  - TFM import improvements
    - implement looping
  - XM import improvements
    - new envelope conversion algorithm
  - add ability to set multiple key binds for actions
  - FM 30xx (hard reset envelope) now working on VGM export
  - OPZ improvements (per-op frequency control including arp/pitch macros)
  - support for MSX2 .dmf (no, I am not going to support its weird AY manners. sorry!)
  - add ability to create a sample from a wavetable
  - per-op fixed octave/block setting in OPN, OPL and ESFM (useful for SSG-EG)
  - CSM on all OPN chips
  - Combat Vehicle improvements
    - small stages, modifiers, special powerups and planes
  - fix a possible crash on macOS when the font texture is too large
  - fix two possible hangs in MIDI code when audio output isn't working
  - fix crash when selecting all after expanding/collapsing/change-effect-counting channel
  - OPN: fix possible crash when using FM effects on non-FM channels (issue #2286)
  - fix some file loading exploits
    - negative sample length (issue #2316)
    - samples too long in .dmf
    - invalid pitches in .dmf
  - command palette improvements
    - show shortcuts (for actions)
    - color the search characters
    - use non-greedy search to find optimal fuzzy match order
  - fix the "Rendering..." window being too small at times
  - add cursor undo/redo actions
  - add the ability to set a channel visibility mask for user presets

  note for Windows users
  there are two 64-bit versions: the normal one, and a "console" version.
  the console version has the subsystem set to console so you can use Furnace for parsing files and/or playing in console mode (with the -console parameter). be noted that a command prompt will pop up when launching it through Explorer!
  if you don't need to do that, just get the regular version.
