ReleaseNotes: |-
  another release to address a couple bugs present in previous versions, including two or three critical issues (crashes).
  fixes
  - fix severe crash when using OPL4
  - fix possible crash when importing an XM file
  - fix crash when importing a config file
  - fix ESFM output being inverted
  - fix Y channel selector in X/Y osc (thanks Eknous)
  - set default SDL audio driver on Windows Vista to winmm in order to get audio working again
  - fix duty effect not working without note on VRC6
  - fix VIC-20 on/off macro or note off not being taken into account when playing from position
  changes/additions
  - improve chip mixing for certain presets (SCC, PC-88 and PC-98) - thanks Iyatemu!
  - YM2612 chip is now YM2612 by default (it was YM3438 before)
  - Windows 2000 support
  - add winners from the Blank Contest to Demo Songs
  - add speed drift compensation options to VGM export
    - this is added in order to compensate for a slight, yet noticeable difference in playback speed when using DeadFish's Genesis VGM player
  note for Windows XP/Legacy Systems users
  the Windows XP version of Furnace is working once again. I've had an issue with the compiler, which has been temporarily sorted out by downgrading the C runtime package.
  as a bonus, Furnace now supports Windows 2000!!! you'll need DirectX 9 installed though.
  note for Windows Vista users
  this release should work properly on Vista now. it wasn't launching due to dependency on a 7-exclusive function (̶a̶n̶d̶ ̶a̶f̶t̶e̶r̶ ̶f̶i̶x̶i̶n̶g̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶r̶e̶ ̶w̶o̶u̶l̶d̶n̶'̶t̶ ̶b̶e̶ ̶s̶o̶u̶n̶d̶ ̶o̶u̶t̶ ̶o̶f̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶b̶o̶x̶ ̶d̶u̶e̶ ̶t̶o̶ ̶a̶n̶ ̶i̶n̶c̶o̶m̶p̶l̶e̶t̶e̶ ̶W̶A̶S̶A̶P̶I̶ ̶i̶m̶p̶l̶e̶m̶e̶n̶t̶a̶t̶i̶o̶n̶)̶.
  a user has reported that sound still does not work as it should. if it does not, try changing the audio backend to PortAudio in Settings > Audio.
