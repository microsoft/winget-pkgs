ReleaseNotes: |-
  another release to address a couple bugs present in previous versions, including two or three critical issues (crashes).
  fixes
  - fix severe crash when using OPL4
  - fix possible crash when importing an XM file
  - fix crash when importing a config file
  - fix ESFM output being inverted
  - fix Y channel selector in X/Y osc (thanks Eknous)
  - set default SDL audio driver on Windows Vista to winmm in order to get audio working again
  - fix duty effect not working without note on VRC6
  - fix VIC-20 on/off macro or note off not being taken into account when playing from position
  changes/additions
  - improve chip mixing for certain presets (SCC, PC-88 and PC-98) - thanks Iyatemu!
  - YM2612 chip is now YM2612 by default (it was YM3438 before)
  - Windows 2000 support
  - add winners from the Blank Contest to Demo Songs
  - add speed drift compensation options to VGM export
    - this is added in order to compensate for a slight, yet noticeable difference in playback speed when using DeadFish's Genesis VGM player
  note for Windows XP/Legacy Systems users
  the Windows XP version of Furnace is working once again. I've had an issue with the compiler, which has been temporarily sorted out by downgrading the C runtime package.
  as a bonus, Furnace now supports Windows 2000!!! you'll need DirectX 9 installed though.
  note for Windows Vista users
  this release should work properly on Vista now. it wasn't launching due to dependency on a 7-exclusive function (and after fixing there wouldn't be sound out of the box due to an incomplete WASAPI implementation).
