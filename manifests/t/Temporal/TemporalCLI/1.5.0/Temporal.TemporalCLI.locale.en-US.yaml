  New Commands
  - temporal task-queue config commands (set and get). Allows user to set and get Task Queue configs such as rate limit.
  - temporal worker deployment manager-identity commands (set and unset). Allows CLI clients of Worker Deployments that are managed by an automated system (such as the Kubernetes Worker Controller) to safely coordinate with that client to make intended changes and ensure they are not overwritten.
