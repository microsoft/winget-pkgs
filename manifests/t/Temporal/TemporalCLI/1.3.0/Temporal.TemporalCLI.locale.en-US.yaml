ReleaseNotes: |-
  Highlights
  - The built-in Temporal Server has been updated to 1.27.1, and UI Server has been updated to 2.36.0.
  - There are significant changes to the experimental temporal worker deployment commands to expose new Worker Deployment features.
  New Commands
  - temporal workflow metadata shows user-set metadata for a specific Workflow Execution.
  - temporal workflow signal-with-start starts a new Workflow Execution and immediately sends it a Signal.
  Updated Commands
  - The experimental temporal worker deployment set of commands has been updated to expose new Worker Deployment features and improve the user experience.
  - The previously-experimental temporal task-queue versioning set of commands is now deprecated in favor of temporal worker deployment.
  - temporal activity pause and temporal activity unpause can now pause and resume all Activities of a specified type.
  - temporal activity unpause can now resume batches of activities, with jitter applied.
  - temporal workflow list now takes a --page-size option, to be used in exceptional situations when fetching Workflow Executions from the server takes too long.
  - The new --static-summary and --static-details flags can be passed to any command that starts a Workflow Execution, to provide user-defined metadata retrievable via the UI or with temporal workflow metadata.
