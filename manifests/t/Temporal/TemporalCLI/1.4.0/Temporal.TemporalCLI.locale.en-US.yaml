ReleaseNotes: |-
  Experimental environment config support
  CLI now supports an experimental form of environment config. This is a new approach to environment configuration that draws on config files and environment variables and is usable across all Temporal products including SDKs (when implemented). The config subcommands can interact with environment config. This is experimental and therefore not documented yet. Care was taken to be compatible with existing environment variables. When released non-experimentally, this will deprecate the env subcommands/approach.
  ðŸ’¥ TLS now assumed when using API key
  When using --api-key (or the environment variable equivalent), --tls is now assumed. Meaning when using API key, TLS is now enabled by default.
  This is technically a ðŸ’¥ BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY BREAK for those that are using API keys on non-TLS environments. Those users can use --tls=false to re-disable TLS when API key is in use.
