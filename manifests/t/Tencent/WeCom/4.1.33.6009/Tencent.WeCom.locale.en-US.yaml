  I. Efficiency Tools and Basic Experience
  1. Smart Sheet

  - A new customer sales and service follow-up template has been added. The customer management system can be quickly configured through the "Use Wizard" in the template to improve service efficiency.
  - It supports synchronizing data from "Contact Customers" and "Customer Group". New customers do not need to be registered manually and are automatically entered into the smart sheet. Members can record customer follow-up info in the sheet.
  - A "Dashboard" can be created based on the recorded customer info to statistically analyze business data in real-time, making the follow-up status clear at a glance.
  - When the customer status changes or a specified time is reached, members will be reminded to follow up with customer leads according to the "Automations" rules, thereby promoting the service process.
  - It supports adding customer records in the smart sheet to the "Chat Toolbar". When members chat with customers, they can quickly view the current customer info and progress.
  - The maximum number of record rows in a smart sheet has been increased to 100,000, supporting the entry of more customer and business data. Optimized the user experience when there is a large amount of content, viewing and editing become smoother.
  - Equation

It realizes the effects of functions such as SUMIF/VLOOKUP.
  - When adding fields, you can choose from preset formula templates in "Use Formula Calculation" to achieve hundreds of calculation effects such as marking duplicate values, calculating rankings, and accumulating daily sales, without the need to compile your own formulas.
  - Content permissions can be set based on the calculation results of formulas/Search for References to define the scope of content that can be viewed. For example, you can find the person in charge based on the store, and set to only view data of the stores you are responsible for.
  - The Reference field has been upgraded to "Search for References", which can automatically search and reference across sheets based on the info such as members and options, making the reference of content more convenient. It is suitable for scenes such as summarizing the number of tasks by name or finding inventory by product number.
  - Dashboard
  - The dashboard now includes a new "Word Cloud Chart" feature, which provides a visual representation of words that appear frequently in text. This is suitable for scenes such as analyzing customer feedback, product comments, and recruitment interview evaluations.
  - Fields
  - The right-click menu for fields now includes a new option "Generate Member Field", which can be used to create a new member field based on name. It doesn't need to select members one by one.
  - The right-click menu for fields also includes a new option "Adjust to Suitable Column Width", which can be used to quickly adjust the column width based on content length for easier viewing.
