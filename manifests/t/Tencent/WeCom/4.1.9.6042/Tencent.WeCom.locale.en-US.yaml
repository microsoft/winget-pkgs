ReleaseNotes: |-
  Optimized experience and fixed bugs.
  I. Optimized Productivity Tools and Basic Experience
  1. Document
  - Mindmaps are added. Mindmaps can be used for task decomposition and brainstorming so multiple users can collaborate on inspiration and ideas.
  - Workflow is added. Multiple users can collaborate on charts such as flowcharts, UML diagrams, and swim lane diagrams to intuitively present complex steps with graphics.
  - An automated process is added. You can configure conditions in smart forms to automatically trigger operations such as record modification and sending notifications. You can set up processes such as "remind me when a record is modified" and "remind me to check at a certain time" to increase collaboration efficiency.
  - The link copying experience is optimized. The right-click menu on the document list or tab page can be used to copy links.

  - Question configurations in forms are optimized. The single-select, multi-select, and drop-down list questions can be switched.

  - The display of online document size is optimized. If a document is large, the reason why it occupies more storage is displayed to help users learn about the document size.
  2. Email
  - A warning message is displayed and images in the email are hidden when there are potential risks associated with the sender or content of the email. This helps prevent deception and fraud.
  - If the sender's alias appears to be fake or suspicious, the sender's email address is displayed instead of the alias to reduce the risk of being misled by false information.
  - If the email contains suspicious links that may lead to phishing scams or malicious software, a warning message is displayed to prevent the recipient from visiting the links and exposing themselves to potential harm.
  - The IPv6 protocol is supported.
  - OAuth login for the Exchange service is supported.
  - Admins can upload the "Email Adding Guide" and submit the server information, making it easier for members to add accounts.
