ReleaseNotes: |-
  lnav v0.13.2
  Bug Fixes:
  - Some keys were not recognized correctly because the
    Kitty keyboard protocol handling was broken at the
    last minute.
  - The TUI no longer opens if a bad file name is passed.
  - The abbreviated month %b time-conversion was not
    always falling back to English locale, which could
    prevent lnav from starting up.
  - The top of the LOG view could move in some cases when
    filtering was enabled.
  - Some status bar fields were not always showing
    updates.
