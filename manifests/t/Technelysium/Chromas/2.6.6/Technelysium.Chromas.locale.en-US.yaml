Description: |-
  Chromas is a free trace viewer for simple DNA sequencing projects which do not require assembly of multiple sequences. Chromas has the following features:
  - Opens .ab1 chromatogram files from Applied Biosystems DNA sequencers.
  - Opens SCF and ZTR format chromatogram files created by other sequencers or retrieved from databases.
  - Save in .scf or Applied Biosystems .ab1 format.
  - Print a chromatogram with options to zoom or fit to one page.
  - Automatic removal of low-quality sequence (when quality data is available) or vector sequences.
  - Export sequences in plain text, FASTA, FASTQ, EMBL, GenBank or GCG formats, or formatted with base numbering for presentation.
  - Copy the sequence to the clipboard in plain text, FASTA or FASTQ format for pasting into other applications.
  - Reverse & complement the sequence and chromatogram.
  - Search for subsequences by exact matching or optimal alignment.
  - Display translations in 3 frames along with the sequence.
  - Copy an image of a chromatogram section for pasting into documents or presentations.
  - Batch processing, including format conversion, sequence export with vector removal, batch printing and batch export of raw data.
  - Enhance .ab1 files using the PeakTrace RP component from Nucleics Pty Ltd to improve peak readability and extract more high-quality bases.
