ShortDescription: Software GUI for Remote Control of SLS60x Light Sources
Description: The SLS60x software GUI’s controls duplicate most front panel functions, including intensity adjustment, turning the light source on/off, opening and closing the shutter, and activating/deactivating the ports on the back panel. The software GUI and front panel controls are enabled at the same time. Both constantly read the light source's status and update their displayed information accordingly (e.g. any adjustments made to the light source using the front panel is registered by and used to update the status of the GUI).
