ShortDescription: Software GUI for Remote Control of SLS701 Light Source
Description: The SLS701 software GUI’s controls duplicate most front panel functions, including intensity adjustment, turning the light source on/off, toggling between open-loop and closed-loop operation, and activating/deactivating the ports on the back panel. The software GUI and front panel controls are enabled at the same time. Both constantly read the light source's status and update their displayed information accordingly (e.g. any adjustments made to the light source using the front panel is registered by and used to update the status of the GUI).
