ShortDescription: Interact with Thorlabs hardware control units via USB.
Description: The Kinesis software allows the user to interact with any number of hardware control units connected to the PC USB Bus. This program allows multiple graphical instrument panels to be displayed so that multiple units can be controlled. All basic operating parameters can be set through the software, and all basic operations (such as motor moves) can be initiated. Hardware configurations and parameter settings can be saved and reloaded, which simplifies system set up.
