ShortDescription: A powerful image acquisition application for Thorlabs cameras on Windows systems.
Description: |-
  ThorCam is a powerful image acquisition application that is designed for use with our cameras on 32- and 64-bit Windows® 7, 10, or 11 systems. The graphical user interface communicates with the camera to provide system control, image acquisition, and image review. Single images and image sequences may be captured and played back using ThorCam or supported third-party software.
  We also offer application programming interfaces (APIs) and software development kits (SDKs) for Windows for the development of custom applications by OEMs and developers. These materials are included with ThorCam and are also available separately on the Programming Interfaces tab, where we also offer a Linux SDK for our Compact Scientific Cameras (excluding the 1.3 MP Kiralux™ cameras).
