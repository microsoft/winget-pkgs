ShortDescription: The React Three Fiber visual IDE.
Description: |-
  Triplex is a powerful development environment for React Three Fiber where your source code powers the editor, exposed through controls.
  When you make changes in the editor your source code updates and when you make changes to your source code, the editor updates.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  New features
  - The editor camera can now be set as the "default" camera by using the "Toggle Editor As Default" action using the floating scene controls. This makes the default camera be the editor one when looking through the editor camera, useful for debugging camera related features when appropriate.
  Bug fixes
  - Components that are no longer exported are now gracefully handled. Instead of an error being thrown the UI remains available prompting you to export the component again.
  - The editor camera is no longer repositioned if the scene suspends after initially loading, eliminating some user jank.
  - The selection outline in 3D components now ignores transparency from textures, instead outlining the entire mesh. This gives a less distracting outline.
  Chores
  - Upgrade three.js deps.
  - Upgrade statsig dependencies to the latest version.
