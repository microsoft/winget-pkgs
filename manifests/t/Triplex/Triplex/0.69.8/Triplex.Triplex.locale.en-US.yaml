ShortDescription: The React Three Fiber visual IDE.
Description: |-
  Triplex is a powerful development environment for React Three Fiber where your source code powers the editor, exposed through controls.
  When you make changes in the editor your source code updates and when you make changes to your source code, the editor updates.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  New features
  - Progressively testing axis helper to replace the view cube helper.
  - Shader material elements now automatically recompile when their fragment/vertex shader prop changes.
  Bug fixes
  - Errors thrown when rendering, initialising modules, importing dependencies, interacting with scene objects, and GLSL compilation are now all captured, notifying you of the error.
    Where possible errors are also recoverable, meaning you can update your code, save, and continue where you left off.
  - Remove forced key set on transformed scene objects, fixing unexpected re-mounting from happening.
  - Fix pressing escape not blurring the selected scene object after performing a transform with transform controls.
  - Transform steps have been rounded to whole decimals.
  - Selection cycle now correctly works with custom components and groups.
  - The selection outline post processing effect no longer unintentionally turns on all layers for the camera now, instead only turning on what was initially turned on.
  - Fix camera modifiers not being applied when initially focused inside editor controls.
  - Selecting helper objects such as cameras and lights now participate in the mesh based selection system enabling selection cycling and selection outlines.
  Chores
  - The global provider architecture has been refactored to not cause jarring hot module reloads when its contents change.
  - Loading spinner has moved to the top right of the scene.
  - Remove unstable subsequent suspense boundary that was causing instability.
