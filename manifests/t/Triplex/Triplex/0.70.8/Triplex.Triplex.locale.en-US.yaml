ReleaseNotes: |-
  New features
  - React 19 / Three Fiber 9 are now supported.
  - The camera settings menu in the floating scene controls panel have been moved into a new scene settings menu. Find it in the same spot with the "cog" icon.
  - Scene controls and options will now be contextually shown depending if there is a Three Fiber canvas mounted to the scene.
  Bug fixes
  - Fixed literal union type labels not being resolved for some scenarios.
  - String and number inputs now show their type as a placeholder even when a label is defined. For example previously it would show as "label", now it shows as "label (number)" / "label (string)" where appropriate.
  - Fix logo curvature.
  - Userland createRoot() calls are now stubbed out to prevent undefined behavior when opening.
  Chores
  - Revert disabling selecting when transform is enabled as it's annoying.
