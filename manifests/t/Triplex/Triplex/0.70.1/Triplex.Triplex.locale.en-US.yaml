ShortDescription: The React Three Fiber visual IDE.
Description: |-
  Triplex is a powerful development environment for React Three Fiber where your source code powers the editor, exposed through controls.
  When you make changes in the editor your source code updates and when you make changes to your source code, the editor updates.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Breaking changes
  - The rendererAttributes property has been removed from the config.json.
    If you were relying on this instead declare a Canvas component from the @react-three/fiber package and set props as desired.
  New features
  - Triplex can now open components that have both HTML and Three Fiber elements.
    Improvements and features will come to the HTML component workflow in the future.
  - The Three Fiber scene now shows an outline on selectable objects when hovering over them.
  Bug fixes
  - Fix selection outline looking thick on thin aspect ratios.
  - Fixed an exception being thrown when exiting play state after some time has passed.
  - Fixed tuple prop types from appearing in the selection panel if there were no supported types.
  - Fixed an edge case when selecting a host element and it resolving to an unexpected parent element.
  - Union props that have all unsupported args are now shown as a single unsupported input in the selection panel rather than just not rendering anything.
  - Fixed edge cases where transform props wouldn't be picked up when used inside spread props.
  - Fixed an edge case where nested object 3ds were being translated by transform controls in unexpected ways, caused by an internal flag being set when it shouldn't have.
  - Selecting a fragment now highlights all child elements in the scene.
  - Zoom to element on fragments now focuses the camera on all of its child elements instead of the first.
  - Selection state is now retained when entering and exiting play state with the play controls.
  - The children prop can now be edited inside the element panel for all supported types.
  - Shorthand JSX fragments are now properly supported in the scene panel.
  - The attach prop for Three Fiber elements is now visible for elements that define it.
  Chores
  - Vite bundler has been upgraded to version 6.
  - TypeScript has been upgraded to the latest version.
  - Internal refactor of the selection system.
  New features
  - Add skeleton state loader for the panel.
  Bug fixes
  - Fix selection outline looking thick on thin aspect ratios.
  - Three.js elements props are no longer erroneously marked as required.
  - Props are now grouped or excluded depending on data collected when analyzing an elements props.
    More custom components should see their props groups if they use Three.js types.
