ShortDescription: The React Three Fiber visual IDE.
Description: |-
  Triplex is a powerful development environment for React Three Fiber where your source code powers the editor, exposed through controls.
  When you make changes in the editor your source code updates and when you make changes to your source code, the editor updates.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Bug fixes
  - Changes that result in no code change are no longer added to the undo/redo stack.
  - Fix provider data being preloaded when it hasn't been set by users yet.
  - The scene graph is now reset when entering play state from edit state.
  - Fixed an edge case where stale scene objects could stick around when resetting the scene.
  - The editor grid has now been positioned slightly above y=0 so it doesn't z-fight with other objects placed on y=0.
  - Duplicate entries found in during hit testing for selecting elements in the scene are now removed, fixing an edge case where cycle selection would not work as expected.
  - Fixed an edge case where some elements were unable to be selected through the editor scene.
  - The canvas is now immediately focused when entering play state.
  - The editor camera now behaves the same on initial load, interacting with the axis controls, and using the "zoom to element" action.
  - Transform controls are no longer rendered in the scene if the selected scene element takes no transform props.
  - The editor camera now ignores very large objects when reorienting to scene objects.
  - Fix userland keyboard events being triggered outside of play state.
  - Fix @react-three/viverse requiring @react-three/xr to be installed before running in Triplex.
  - Errors are no longer thrown if a components name could not be resolved.
  - Untyped host elements no-longer throw an exception when selecting through the elements panel.
  - The camera preview no longer has the selection outline of the camera visible.
  - Switching from default to editor camera now correctly fits the scene to it on the first switch.
  - Switching the canvas camera between editor and defaul no longer bleeds state between each other.
  - Resetting a component that renders a canvas now persists the camera settings.
  - Fix an internal error where a function that should have been defined wasn't.
