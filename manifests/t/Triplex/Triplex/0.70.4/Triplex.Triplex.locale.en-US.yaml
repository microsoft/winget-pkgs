ShortDescription: The React Three Fiber visual IDE.
Description: |-
  Triplex is a powerful development environment for React Three Fiber where your source code powers the editor, exposed through controls.
  When you make changes in the editor your source code updates and when you make changes to your source code, the editor updates.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Bug fixes
  - Fix sprites not being selectable in the scene
  - Using a Canvas component from @react-three/fiber along with other custom components are now correctly flagged as a "react" root instead of a "three-fiber" root.
  - Fixed a long standing bug where rotation transforms weren't correctly marked where statically used as the code analysis was looking for "rotate" instead of "rotation".
  - Hover selection indicators are now disabled when transform controls are visible.
  - Fixed regression where transforms were affecting more than one scene object.
    This primarily affected custom components that had multiple child meshes.
  Chores
  - JavaScript based projects no-longer have a tsconfig.json generated when starting up in Triplex.
  - A new loading indicator has been implemented.
