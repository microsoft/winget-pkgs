ShortDescription: The React Three Fiber visual IDE.
Description: |-
  Triplex is a powerful development environment for React Three Fiber where your source code powers the editor, exposed through controls.
  When you make changes in the editor your source code updates and when you make changes to your source code, the editor updates.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Bug fixes
  - Fix root analysis using locally defined components sourced from inside components, which are now ignored. This is because the component isn't in the module scope and can't be statically used prior to the component rendering.
  - Fix edgecase where the Fragment named import wouldn't be imported when using shorthand fragments.
  - Add edge case support for assuming a react-three-fiber root if a custom component was found that starts with "object3d".
  - The selection system now harmoniously works between reconcilers, exactly as you'd expect.
  - Fix React 19 warnings for using inert prop with strings.
  - Fix React 19 warnings for accessing refs on Fragments.
  - Canvas components no longer take up the entire space when rendered in userland but instead applying the default behaviour.
  - Fix jsconfig paths not being respected by the scene environment.
