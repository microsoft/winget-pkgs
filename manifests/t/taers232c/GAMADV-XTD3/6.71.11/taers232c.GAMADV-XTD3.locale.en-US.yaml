The change improved the performance when showmimetype selected a small number of files;\nthe information for just those files was downloaded and then additional API calls were made to construct the file paths.\nHowever, if a large number of files were selected, the additional APIs calls decreased performance.Added option mimetypeinquery can be used when you expect the query to return a small number of files\nrelative to the total number of files.6.71.09Improved the performance of gam <UserTypeEntity> print filelist when showmimetype and filepath|fullpath\nare both specified.6.71.08Added option oneitemperrow to 'gam print admins|adminroles` to have each of a\nroles privileges displayed on a separate row with all of the other admin/role fields.\nThis produces a CSV file that can be used in subsequent commands without further script processing.6.71.07Added command to upload changes to Google Docs.- See: \n6.71.06Added additional error handling to Gmail Client Side Encryption commands.Added license product Education Endpoint Management- ProductID - 101049\nAdded license SKU Endpoint Education Upgrade- ProductID - 101049\n- SKUID - 1010490001 | eeu\n6.71.05Fixed a bug introduced in 6.71.00 that caused a trap in gam <UserTypeEntity> print filelist.Added option tdfrom <EmailAddress> to  <ToDriveAttribute> that causes GAM to use <EmailAddress> as the from address\nin all emails sent.

When a todrive file is created or updated,\nGAM will send notification emails to all tdalert <EmailAddress> users if tdnotify is true.\n<EmailAddress> must be valid within your Google Workspace.6.71.02Added additional error handling to Gmail Client Side Encryption commands.6.71.01Fixed bug in gam audit monitor create that caused a trap.6.71.00Added csv_output_sort_headers string list variable to gam.cfg that causes GAM to sort CSV output\nrows by the column headers specified in the variable.
