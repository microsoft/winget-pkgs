Typically, you would read CSV file of email addresses\nto verify as domain members.- See: \nAdded option addcsvdata <FieldName> <String> to gam print users that adds\nadditional columns of data to the CSV file output. Typically, you would read CSV file of email addresses\nto generate a CSV file of results and copy data from the input CSV to the outout CSV.6.70.03Renamed license product DuetAI to Gemini- ProductID - 101047\nRenamed license SKU DuetAI for Google Workspace to Gemini Enterprise- ProductID - 101047\n- SKUID - 1010470001 | geminient | duetai\nAdded support for license SKU Gemini Business- ProductID - 101047\n- SKUID - 1010470003 | geminibiz\n6.70.02In 6.69.00, GAM starting using course owner access when using copyfrom in gam create|update course\nregardless of the value of gam.cfg/use_course_owner_access. This prevents copying from courses\nwith a deleted user. GAM now uses the value of gam.cfg/use_course_owner_access when copyfrom is used.6.70.01Added gmail_cse_incert_dir and gmail_cse_inkey_dir path variables to gam.cfg that provide\ndefault values for the incertdir <FilePath> and inkeydir <FilePath> options in gam <UserTypeEntity> create csekeypair.6.70.00Added support for Gmail Client Side Encryption.- See: \nThis is an initial, minimally tested release; proceed with care and report all issues.6.69.00Added use_classroom_owner_access Boolean variable to gam.cfg that controls how GAM gets\nclassroom member information and removes students/teachers. Client access does not provide\ncomplete information about non-domain students/teachers.- False - Use client access; this is the default. Use if you don't have non-domain members in your courses.\n- True - Use service account access as the classroom owner. An extra API call is required per course to authenticate the owner; this will affect performance\nAdded the following command which must be used to delete classroom invitations for non-domain students/teachers.\n\ngam delete classroominvitation courses <CourseEntity> (ids <ClassroomInvitationIDEntity>)|(role all|owner|student|teacher)\n\nYou can obtain the classroom invitation IDs with these commands:\n\ngam show classroominvitations (course|class <CourseEntity>)*|([teacher <UserItem>] [student <UserItem>] [states <CourseStateList>])\n        [role all|owner|student|teacher] [formatjson]\ngam print classroominvitations [todrive <ToDriveAttribute>*] (course|class <CourseEntity>)*|([teacher <UserItem>] [student <UserItem>] [states <CourseStateList>])\n        [role all|owner|student|teacher] [formatjson [quotechar <Character>]]\n\n6.68.08Updated gam <UserTypeEntity> print filelist|drivefileacls|shareddriveacls ... oneitemperrow to print\nACLs with multiple permission details on separate rows for each basic permission/permission detail combination.\nThis case occurs when a member of a Shared Drive has access to a file and also has explicitly granted access to the same file.Added permtype member|file to <PermissionMatch> that allows determining whether an ACL on a Shared Drive file was\nderived from membership or explicitly granted.6.68.07Updated gam info user ... locations formatjson to include the buildingName field in the\nlocations entries. If gam.cfg contains quick_info_user = true or the quick option\nis included on the command line, add the option buildingnames to the command line.6.68.06Fixed bug in gam <UserTypeEntity> copy drivefile <DriveFileID> ... mergewithparent that incorrectly named\nthe copied file with the name of the parent folder.Updated gam <UserTypeEntity> copy|move drivefile to avoid copying/moving the same file twice.6.68.05Updated gam print groups ... ciallfields|(cifields <CIGroupFieldNameList>) to account for an\nAPI shortcoming that failed to get all of the Cloud Identity fields.6.68.04Added option skiprows <Integer> to gam csv|loop that causes GAM to skip processing the first <Integer> filtered rows.- See: \n6.68.03Fixed bug in gam <UserTypeEntity> create drivefileacl that caused a trap.6.68.02Upgraded to Python 3.12.2 where possible.Added options restricted|(audience <String>) to gam <UserTypeEntity> create|update chatspace that\nsets the access options for the chat space. These options are in Developer Preview and will not be generally available.6.68.01Fixed <PermissionMatch> bug for real.6.68.00Fixed <PermissionMatch> bug introduced in 6.67.35 that caused a command error like the following or would\nnot properly match type|nottype <DriveFileACLType> and role|notrole <DriveFileACLRole>.\n\nERROR: permission attribute allowfilediscovery/withlink not allowed with type {'a', 'y', 'e', 'o', 'n'}\n\nMy sincere apologies.Installation\nIf you are a first time Gam user:If you are updating your GAMADV-XTD3 version:If you are upgrading from standard GamIf you are upgrading from GAMADV-X or GAMADV-XTDsha256 hashes\n\n\nbbbc6cfc2e4c5c99993c1d9862fc94be09fab31e91880ff21f0f95f08b8494ad  gamadv-xtd3-6.70.04-linux-arm64-glibc2.23.tar.xz\n94bf884d1c527c72447730dc713b1b9cca6b1a2ea1f957ebd5f2b169da567554  gamadv-xtd3-6.70.04-linux-arm64-glibc2.27.tar.xz\n607454a331ef2a595b8fd3a5592e1aef9f2bcecf7e826b9682d04255b1030f9a  gamadv-xtd3-6.70.04-linux-arm64-glibc2.31.tar.xz\n7c58d36201cc4b6d4a6b680d739d4f59d75941a311d579cb0331352a7a93a997  gamadv-xtd3-6.70.04-linux-x86_64-glibc2.19.tar.xz\n76756c7e606624a1445d3a41358a6aaf4d95100f6ccc89ad56ef061bc25a6380  gamadv-xtd3-6.70.04-linux-x86_64-glibc2.23.tar.xz\n6483388ef875433f28eab007c77e49c2d2ff84acf2b4263dfa5a44785b13d642  gamadv-xtd3-6.70.04-linux-x86_64-glibc2.27.tar.xz\n03d2443686bdb1cf62dcd08d6bcc5905681fff7ddbee86a5a62049062188d729  gamadv-xtd3-6.70.04-linux-x86_64-glibc2.31.tar.xz\n70338ec692a465a830e66bf5cf26ce3d3f805735fefcb54ce6eee4d945a56e38  gamadv-xtd3-6.70.04-linux-x86_64-glibc2.35.tar.xz\n0aea72bae6338c309f8da1286d3acadc3613147bc3b898620e66815c27786c9b  gamadv-xtd3-6.70.04-linux-x86_64-legacy.tar.xz\n6ac8db95d1e188015415cdc917b3a775ea65b69ff4981b7aa069c9ebf4333f44  gamadv-xtd3-6.70.04-macos-arm64.tar.xz\nc68907ece58be132402c3a31765854155434e8f1e9f65a7dd9ab5d24396cb065  gamadv-xtd3-6.70.04-macos-x86_64.tar.xz\n60ba2045a3e3d2ee3e0d7775d8066c5c3868bdfb28abad006da2e6d48ee44b17  gamadv-xtd3-6.70.04-windows-x86_64.msi\n6d275149ce1d71717506be900c65346aabe410bc86f3e79708e7a77bc5d86264  gamadv-xtd3-6.70.04-windows-x86_64.zip"
