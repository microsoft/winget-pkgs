An extra API call is required per course to authenticate the owner; this will affect performance\nAdded the following command which must be used to delete classroom invitations for non-domain students/teachers.\n\ngam delete classroominvitation courses <CourseEntity> (ids <ClassroomInvitationIDEntity>)|(role all|owner|student|teacher)\n\nYou can obtain the classroom invitation IDs with these commands:\n\ngam show classroominvitations (course|class <CourseEntity>)*|([teacher <UserItem>] [student <UserItem>] [states <CourseStateList>])\n        [role all|owner|student|teacher] [formatjson]\ngam print classroominvitations [todrive <ToDriveAttribute>*] (course|class <CourseEntity>)*|([teacher <UserItem>] [student <UserItem>] [states <CourseStateList>])\n        [role all|owner|student|teacher] [formatjson [quotechar <Character>]]\n\n6.68.08Updated gam <UserTypeEntity> print filelist|drivefileacls|shareddriveacls ... oneitemperrow to print\nACLs with multiple permission details on separate rows for each basic permission/permission detail combination.\nThis case occurs when a member of a Shared Drive has access to a file and also has explicitly granted access to the same file.Added permtype member|file to <PermissionMatch> that allows determining whether an ACL on a Shared Drive file was\nderived from membership or explicitly granted.6.68.07Updated gam info user ... locations formatjson to include the buildingName field in the\nlocations entries. If gam.cfg contains quick_info_user = true or the quick option\nis included on the command line, add the option buildingnames to the command line.6.68.06Fixed bug in gam <UserTypeEntity> copy drivefile <DriveFileID> ... mergewithparent that incorrectly named\nthe copied file with the name of the parent folder.Updated gam <UserTypeEntity> copy|move drivefile to avoid copying/moving the same file twice.6.68.05Updated gam print groups ... ciallfields|(cifields <CIGroupFieldNameList>) to account for an\nAPI shortcoming that failed to get all of the Cloud Identity fields.6.68.04Added option skiprows <Integer> to gam csv|loop that causes GAM to skip processing the first <Integer> filtered rows.- See: \n6.68.03Fixed bug in gam <UserTypeEntity> create drivefileacl that caused a trap.6.68.02Upgraded to Python 3.12.2 where possible.Added options restricted|(audience <String>) to gam <UserTypeEntity> create|update chatspace that\nsets the access options for the chat space.
