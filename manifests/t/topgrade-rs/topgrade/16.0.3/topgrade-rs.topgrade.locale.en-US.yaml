ShortDescription: Topgrade detects which tools you use and runs the appropriate commands to update them.
Description: Keeping your system up to date usually involves invoking multiple package managers. This results in big, non-portable shell one-liners saved in your shell. To remedy this, Topgrade detects which tools you use and runs the appropriate commands to update them.

  Topgrade v16.0.3
  Here is a new release! Some nice features:
  1. Fedora users now have a Copr they can use, a new option to install Topgrade on Fedora Linux.
  2. Topgrade can now run JetBrains toolbox, and update your installed IDEs, this feels amazing considering it is a GUI app
  3. New i18n language support:
     1. Chinese (simplified)
     2. German
     3. Lithuanian
  Enjoy:)
