ReleaseNotes: |-
  Overview
  - This release should greatly improve the speed and stability of Tribler startup:
  - Now, if a user has a large number of downloads, Tribler windows should open much faster.
  - All different errors of type "Tribler GUI cannot connect to Tribler Core" should go away.
  - Tribler should not crash anymore while copying files from the previous directory.
  - The copying of the state directory is now atomic, and files should not be corrupted if the copying is interrupted in the middle.
  - No more orphan Core processes if the GUI process was suddenly terminated.
  - The token balance is now hidden until the algorithm for calculating the balance is updated.
  - Some bugs that caused Tribler crashes were fixed.
