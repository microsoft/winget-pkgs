ShortDescription: A simple environment for editing, typesetting, and previewing TeX documents
Description: |-
  TeXworks is an environment for authoring TeX (LaTeX, ConTeXt, etc) documents, with a Unicode-based, TeX-aware editor, integrated PDF viewer, and a clean, simple interface accessible to casual and non-technical users.
  TeXworks is inspired by Dick Koch's award-winning TeXShop program for Mac OS X, which has made quality typesetting through TeX accessible to a wider community of users, without a technical or intimidating face. The goal of TeXworks is to deliver a similarly integrated, easy-to-use environment for users on other platforms, especially GNU/Linux and Windows.
  Among other things, TeXworks features an integrated PDF previewer, synchronization between the TeX files and the PDF output, and an extensible scripting interface.
