  Fix Bug for incorrect output dir
  Add a bug fix that had been introduced in 1.14 that prepended the .ext of the file to the directory name. This is now fixed and correctly uses the specified output directory.
  Tests added via PHP.
  Now using a PHP Laravel project with Pest Tests to provide Functional testing of outputs. Obviously not going to test the Dephi code but will test the .exe outputs and changes as much as it can. If you are a php dev please feel free to add tests.
  Hide Temp Files
  Temp word files if found are now ignored. ~$filename.doc , .~filename.doc
  If for some odd reason you want to convert a temp file you can still do so by specifying individual filenames.
  Breaking Change
  In the small chance that you have written scripts to rely on this behaviour eg you output files going to
  > c:\myfiles\output\.pdf\
  instead of
  > c:\myfiles\output\
  You will need to change your scripts as all files will now be output to the last directory.
