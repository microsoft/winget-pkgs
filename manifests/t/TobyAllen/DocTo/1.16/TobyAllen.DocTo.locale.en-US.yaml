  Full Changelog: v1.15...v1.16
  Announcing Docto.Works
  I have put up a conversion website Docto.Works that uses DocTo.exe in the backend to convert documents to pdf, html, txt.
  Currently version of the website only allows basic conversion of Word Documents to pdf, html or txt however I am working on adding Excel conversion and adding in parameters to allow for most of the conversions you would do with DocTo.
  Once you have signed up for an account on https://Docto.Works you can create an API key and convert from command line like this
  Windows
  > curl.exe -f "http://docto.works/api/v1/{apikey}/docto/pdf" -F "file=@C:\Folder\salad.docx" -o "c:\output\Salad.pdf"
  As long as apikey is valid, this request should download a pdf to c:\output\Salad.pdf
  Mac and Linux
  The real interest comes with Mac and Linux where DocTo.exe doesnt work.
  > curl -f "http://docto.works/api/v1/{apikey}/docto/pdf" -F "file=@/̶F̶o̶l̶d̶e̶r̶/̶s̶a̶l̶a̶d̶.̶d̶o̶c̶x̶"̶ ̶-̶o̶ ̶"̶/output/Salad.pdf"
  There is also a .sh script you can download to make it even easier to convert.
  Sign up and check it out.
  When you sign up to docto.works you get 250 tokens for free. I would love feedback about the site and whether you find it useful. You can provide feedback to this repo or to info@docto.works
  Extra Tokens to get started.
  Send me an email to info@docto.works with the email address you registered with and i will add 1000 tokens to your account.
  Breaking Changes
  Excel Macros
  Previously I switched off autorun of Word Macros #205 . This release now also switches off Excel Macros by Default. As with word macros it is possible to switch on if you wish
    --enable-macroautorun
    --enable-wordvbaauto
    --enable-xlvbaauto
        By Default any autorun vba will not run, use this parameter if you wish vba to Autorun. Word / Excel Only.
  This is a Breaking Change. If you were relying on a macro running in an excel spreadsheet on opening you will need to update your command line to include --enable-xlvbaauto
  Virus False Positive
  The whole point of Docto is that it manipulates Word and Excel using OLE Components on windows. Additionally since 1.14 it has switched off Auto run of macros when loading Word Documents and with this release the same for Excel Workbooks. Unfortunately heuristics in the various Virus Scanners see these various aspects of DocTo as possibly being a virus. DocTo is not a virus, but it is marked as such by many of the Virus Scanners.
  I will try to submit updates to the various scanners, but at the end of the day you need to decide if you are happy to run the executable.
  Thanks for using DocTo and check out Docto.Works
