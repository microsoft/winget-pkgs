  Important
  SmartScreen & Gatekeeper notice
  The current Windows installer may trigger a SmartScreen ('unrecognized developer') warning on some systems, because I'm publishing these installers as unsigned binaries.
  The macOS installer warns you that "macOS cannot verify that this app is free from malware" because there is no Apple Developer ID associated with the project, and hence there is no code signing certificate.
  You need to open the system settings and allow the installer to execute in the Privacy & Security screen.
  Unfortunately, using a proper code signing certificate for Windows or macOS is not an option for me since I cannot afford recurring monthly payments for an open-source app with a zero budget.
  What's Changed
  - Added option to override earbud color by @salihefee in #583
  - Also pause playback if earbuds are taken off by @salihefee in #584 (if resume playback when wearing earbuds is enabled)
  Fixes
  - Windows: Fixed title bar control colors by @Abdo-reda in #589
  - Fixed cross-thread UI calls in EarbudStatusUnit (#593) by @NilaierMusic in #594
  Translation updates
  - Updated Turkish translations by @erffy in #591
  - Updated README.md & Korean README.md by @corydalis10 in #592
  - Updated Vietnamese translations by @thelegendaryjohn in #586
  - Fixed README links to the Vietnamese version by @thelegendaryjohn in #587

  Notes & troubleshooting

  Privacy
  - To help me support Buds models I don't own, this app includes a crowdsourcing feature to share data about Samsung's proprietary Bluetooth serial protocol on demand. You can disable this permanently by navigating to 'Settings > Crowdsourcing'. You can view and inspect all active crowdsourcing experiments here.
  - This application collects crash dumps in case of fatal application crashes and sends them to my sentry.io dashboard (can also be disabled in settings).
  Notes for Linux users
  - x86_64-musl binaries are only compatible with libc-musl based distributions (e.g., Alpine Linux).
  - You need to give the binary execute permissions before launching it: chmod +x GalaxyBudsClient
  How to fix connection issues on WindowsIf you experience issues while connecting or using the Galaxy Buds with this app, you can do the following:
  1. Unregister your earbuds in the app if not already done, like this: Options > Unregister device
  2. Proceed to the device selection page
  3. Disable the switch with the label 'Use alternative Bluetooth backend' (Windows only)
  4. Select your earbuds from the list and continue
  Get it on Google Play
