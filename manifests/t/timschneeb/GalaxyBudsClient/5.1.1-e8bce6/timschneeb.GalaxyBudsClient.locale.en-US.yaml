ReleaseNotes: "Download links are attached at the bottom of this post.\n[!IMPORTANT]SmartScreen & Gatekeeper notice\nThe current Windows installer may trigger a SmartScreen ('unrecognized developer') warning on some systems, because I'm publishing these installers as unsigned binaries.\nThe macOS installer warns you that \"macOS cannot verify that this app is free from malware\" because there is no Apple Developer ID associated with the project, and hence there is no code signing certificate.\nYou need to open the system settings and allow the installer to execute in the Privacy & Security screen.Unfortunately, using a proper code signing certificate for Windows or macOS is not an option for me since I cannot afford recurring monthly payments for an open-source app with a zero budget.\nWhat's Changed\n- 1st-gen Buds, Buds+, Buds Live, Buds Pro only:\n    - Support for sending \"hidden commands\"\n    - Ability to modify the serial number, device id, SKU, and internal Bluetooth addresses (for manual pairing)\n    - Power menu (shutdown, reboot, ...)\n    - Ability to enable the hardware UART debug port\n- All devices:\n    - Display individual left & right SW/HW/TouchSW versions for each earbud\n    - Added an option to collapse the navigation sidebar\nMinor changes & bug fixes\n- Upgrade Avalonia to 11.2.2\n- Bug fixes for Buds3 & Buds3 Pro support\n- Fixed issue #519: Dynamic tray icon \"Show lowest battery doesn't work anymore\" by @QuarkZ26 in #546\n- Fixed case serial number & SW version getting mixed up #535\nTranslation updates\n- Turkish translation updated by @Eta06 in #528\n- Korean translation updated by @backryun in #536\n- Chinese translation updated by @YexuanXiao in #548\n- Czech translation updated by @Joedmin\n\n[!NOTE]Notes & troubleshooting\nClick to expand sections.\n  \nThank you for 3700+ stars on GitHub!\nFull Changelog: https://github.com/timschneeb/GalaxyBudsClient/compare/5.1.0...5.1.1"
