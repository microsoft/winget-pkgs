  Note to Linux users
  - x86_64-musl binaries are only compatible with libc-musl based distributions (e.g., Alpine Linux).
  - You need to give the binary execute permissions before launching it: chmod +x GalaxyBudsClient
  - If your system language is set to a language that has non-Latin characters (Korean, Japanese, Chinese), you need to start the app like this: LC_ALL=C ./GalaxyBudsClient (temporary workaround)
  Privacy
  - This application collects crash dumps in case of fatal application crashes and sends them to my sentry.io dashboard (can be disabled in settings).
  - To help me support Buds models I don't own, this app includes a crowdsourcing feature to share data about Samsung's proprietary Bluetooth serial protocol on demand.
    You can disable this permanently by navigating to 'Settings > Developer options'.
