  [!IMPORTANT]SmartScreen & Gatekeeper notice
  The current Windows installer may trigger a SmartScreen ('unrecognized developer') warning on some systems, because I'm publishing these installers as unsigned binaries.
  The macOS installer warns you that "macOS cannot verify that this app is free from malware" because there is no Apple Developer ID associated with the project, and hence there is no code signing certificate.Unfortunately, using a proper code signing certificate for Windows or macOS is not an option for me since I cannot afford recurring monthly payments for an open-source app with a zero budget.

  Minor changes & bug fixes
