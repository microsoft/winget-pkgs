ShortDescription: An easy-to-use, cross-platform multi-track audio editor/recorder.
Description: |-
  Tenacity is a free and open source audio editor forked from the popular audio editor Audacity. Tenacity is licensed under the GNU General Public License version 2 or later. It contains the following features:
  - Recording from audio devices, real or virtual.
  - Support for importing from and exporting to a wide range of audio formats, extensible with FFmpeg.
  - High quality audio processing, including up to 32-bit float audio support.
  - Extensibility with support for plug-ins, providing support for VST 2, LADSPA/LV2, and AU plugins.
  - Support for scripting in the built-in scripting language Nyquist, or in Python, Perl, and other languages with named pipes.
  - Editing arbitrary sampling and multi-track timeline.
  - Accessibility including editing via keyboard, screen reader support and narration support.
  - Tools useful in the analysis of signals, including audio.
  Tenacity does not have a single application when it comes to audio processing. Musicians recording real instruments can make a song in Tenacity, podcasters can edit their episodes in Tenacity, and even academic researchers can analyze signals using Tenacity. We don’t intend to focus Tenacity on a single area of audio processing, but rather, we intend to focus Tenacity over audio processing in general, including the aforementioned applications.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Happy new year everyone! Sometimes, the best things come to those that wait. While we apologize to have kept you waiting this long, it's certainly paid off, and we want to thank you for waiting for 1.3.4!
  This is a minor release that is focused primarily on refinements and a few backported changes from 1.4. The most notable changes of this release include the integration of patches from MacPorts, courtesy of @ryandesign, which improves macOS support, a bunch of bug fixes, and updated credits in the About Dialog. Speaking of improved macOS support, if you want to try Tenacity on macOS, you should try out the MacPorts package as that is currently the best way to use Tenacity on macOS while we figure out how to get CI working again.
  Fun fact: this release was supposed to be made a lot sooner, but unfortunately, scheduling conflicts came and went, plus the amount of issues that needed fixing took a little while to investigate and fix with our current resources. We hope that the large number of bug fixes helps improve the overall experience and was worth the wait.
  The full changelog for this release is below.
  Changelog
  - Increased default maximum spectrogram frequency to 20 kHz.
  - Tenacity now warns you if you save to a FAT32 drive on FreeBSD.
  - Enabled drag-and-drop project importing.
  - Fix sync-lock drawing.
  - Update about dialog to add new contributors plus Matroska info (#226).
  - Updated manual packaging (#406).
  - Added FFmpeg 7 support (#484; an accidental backport believe it or not but why not ;)
  - Windows: Fixed some flickering issues.
  - Windows: Fixed issues when building Tenacity for ARM.
  - Windows: Fixed issues with garbled text in the installer (#486, #509).
  - Windows: Fixed OGG imports causing crashes (#311, #511)
  - Windows: Changed EXE description to reduce confusion in Task Manager (#510).
  - macOS: Applied patches from @ryandesign to improve macOS support.
  - Haiku: Applied patches from @davidkalory to improve Haiku support.
  - Linux: remove unused launcher script (#358, #513).
  - Some error help buttons and preferences no longer point to broken links (#519).
  - Removed some overhead on initialization (#526).
  For packagers and other advanced users
  - Updated vcpkg to 2024.12.16 (our fork).
  - Enable SBSMS timestretching by default in vcpkg builds.
  - musl libc builds should now be less susceptible to breakage, although you will see new output if ran from the terminal.
  - Build times should be much faster with vcpkg (#483) and slightly faster without it (#405).
  - Due to its use of VLAs and a recent update, lilv is no longer built on Windows. LV2 isn't supported on Windows currently either, but will be once vcpkg has suil.
  - Tenacity can now be built against a more minimal wxWidgets configuration. It only requires the base, core, html, and net wxWidgets libraries now (#525). To see this in action, view our Flatpak maniefst.
  FFmpeg
  Following through what we said in the previous release, we are providing FFmpeg 6.1.2 for Windows 32-bit and 64-bit. Note that this release, if not the next one, will likely be the last to ship 32-bit FFmpeg for Windows. Previous versions of FFmpeg will still be usable going forward until Tenacity drops support for those versions of FFmpeg.
  Flatpak Users
  Note that these updates came before this release and were available before this release. If you haven't updated your Tenacity Flatpak yet, do it now to get these features.
  - Enabled native Matroska importing and exporting (https://github.com/flathub/org.tenacityaudio.Tenacity/pull/31).
  - Slimmed down Flatpak builds a little bit (https://github.com/flathub/org.tenacityaudio.Tenacity/pull/21)
  - Updated dependencies (wxWidgets, suil, etc.).
