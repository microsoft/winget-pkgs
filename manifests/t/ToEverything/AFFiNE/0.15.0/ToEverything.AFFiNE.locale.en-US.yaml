ShortDescription: A privacy-focused, local-first, open-source, and ready-to-use alternative for Notion & Miro. One hyper-fused platform for wildly creative minds.
Description: AFFiNE is an open-source, all-in-one workspace and an operating system for all the building blocks that assemble your knowledge base and much more -- wiki, knowledge management, presentation and digital assets. It's a better alternative to Notion and Miro.
