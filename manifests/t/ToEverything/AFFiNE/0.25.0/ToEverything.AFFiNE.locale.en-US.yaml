ShortDescription: A privacy-focused, local-first, open-source, and ready-to-use alternative for Notion & Miro. One hyper-fused platform for wildly creative minds.
Description: AFFiNE is an open-source, all-in-one workspace and an operating system for all the building blocks that assemble your knowledge base and much more -- wiki, knowledge management, presentation and digital assets. It's a better alternative to Notion and Miro.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  1. Doc icon
  This is a feature long anticipated by our users, and the doc icon has now officially launched. You can now add various emojis to different documents, and also choose from our carefully curated icon collection, with support for multiple color options. We believe this feature will help users organize and manage their documents more efficiently.
  2. MCP
  To further enhance the collaborative efficiency between AFFiNE and other products in your workflow, we have launched the brand new MCP feature. You simply need to select MCP in the integration settings and copy the generated JSON code into tools like Cursor. This will enable Cursor to read the content of your AFFiNE workspace documents, thereby achieving efficient collaboration between documents and code.
  3. Claude Sonnet 4.5 / Gemini 2.5 Pro
  To enhance your AI experience, we have simultaneously updated the latest Claude and Gemini models. You can now select and use these new models from the model list.
  4. Insert AI block
  Now you can directly insert AI-generated blocks into the main text.
