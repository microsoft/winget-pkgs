ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Simplistic field types come up short for modern knowledge bases that require ‘modeling various types of documents’ -- that can be your favorite reading list, movie archive, or academic papers . etc
  - On the AFFiNE Roadmap, our focus lies in fully integrating all database fields into document metadata. We’re progressively enhancing document indexing and bulk management through database blocks. Presently, you have the flexibility to incorporate any database field into the document page info. This enables a clear presentation of essential details like deadlines or tasks right at the outset of the document, streamlining personal project management. Consequently, your team can locate required documents more efficiently. Furthermore, with the introduction of the ‘custom properties’ feature, you can tailor how information is displayed. You have the option to reveal or conceal it in the view, or selectively unveil it when pertinent content is present.
  - In our latest version 0.13.0, we’ve updated this feature, paving the way for seamless integration of page info with collections and the ‘all pages’ view in forthcoming updates.
