  Bug(s) fixed
  - An intermittent bug that sometimes prevented the application from closing has been fixed. It was a long search for a definitive solution. We apologize to users for any inconvenience caused.
  News
  - We decided to remove the function and plotting identifiers from the R language highlighter. The justification is that with an exponential growth observed in the number of available packages over time, we no longer see any sense in coloring (highlighting) only a limited set of them. Performing dynamic coloring as packages are loaded for use in a session is a task that - in addition to being exhausting - can compromise the performance (light and fast) of the application.
  - The project is in an advanced stage of migration to Embarcadero’s new Delphi 11.3 (Alexandria) Community platform.
  Interface
  - Some adjustments have been made to the Tools interface.
  Database
  - The Shortcut_app.xml database has been updated and a few default shortcuts have been modified. As in these updates - whenever possible - the program takes full advantage of the user’s previous preferences, there may be some discrepancy between the shortcuts and their documentation.
