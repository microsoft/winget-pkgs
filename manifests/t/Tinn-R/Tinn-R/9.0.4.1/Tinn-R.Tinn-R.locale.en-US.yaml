  News
  - With the exception of file searching and database filter, all other search engines (open files, directories, contents(TOC), file filter, etc.) now use a more powerful regular expression (RegEx) engine than the native SynEdit engine. The new engine is PCRE-compatible. This increases (a lot) the search capabilities and provides better performance.
  - A mechanism has been implemented that allows the construction of a table of contents (TOC) of open files based on regular expressions (RegEx). In other words, the user can configure how he wants the TOC to be presented. For this purpose, a new table named Contents.xml has been added to the database. Both the table and the TOC interface have been added to the Tools interface.
  - Experimentally, only regular expressions (with source indication in REGEX101 website) were made for some extensions (.R, .Rnw, .tex, .txt, .ini). Our expectation is that we can continue to build and share them as the need arises. One day we hope to have good RegEx for all file extensions supported by the project.
  - The user guide has been considerably improved.
  - The project is in an advanced stage of migration to Embarcadero’s new Delphi 11.3 (Alexandria) Community platform.
  Interface
  - Several adjustments have been made to the Tools interface.
  - The Tools interface receives resources related to the database and table of contents of the file.
  - To highlight all occurrences of the table of contents (TOC) of an open file, an edit box has been added to the Result/Contents (TOC) interface. It is like a filter, but unlike the others related to databases, the action is only performed after typing something (compatible with REGEX-PCRE) and pressing [ENTER].
  Database
  - A new table in the database named Contents.xml has been added to the database.
