ShortDescription: Rapidly build modern websites without ever leaving your HTML.
Description: |-
  Tailwind CSS works by scanning all of your HTML files, JavaScript components, and any other templates for class names, generating the corresponding styles and then writing them to a static CSS file.
  It's fast, flexible, and reliable â€” with zero-runtime.
