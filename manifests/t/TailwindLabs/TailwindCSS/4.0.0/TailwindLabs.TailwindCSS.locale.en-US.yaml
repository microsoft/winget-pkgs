ShortDescription: Rapidly build modern websites without ever leaving your HTML.
Description: |-
  Tailwind CSS works by scanning all of your HTML files, JavaScript components, and any other templates for class names, generating the corresponding styles and then writing them to a static CSS file.
  It's fast, flexible, and reliable — with zero-runtime.
Tags:

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Holy shit it's actually done — we just tagged Tailwind CSS v4.0.
  Tailwind CSS v4.0 is an all-new version of the framework optimized for performance and flexibility, with a reimagined configuration and customization experience, and taking full advantage of the latest advancements the web platform has to offer.
  - New high-performance engine — where full builds are up to 5x faster, and incremental builds are over 100x faster — and measured in microseconds.
  - Designed for the modern web — built on cutting-edge CSS features like cascade layers, registered custom properties with @property, and color-mix().
  - Simplified installation — fewer dependencies, zero configuration, and just a single line of code in your CSS file.
  - First-party Vite plugin — tight integration for maximum performance and minimum configuration.
  - Automatic content detection — all of your template files are discovered automatically, with no configuration required.
  - Built-in import support — no additional tooling necessary to bundle multiple CSS files.
  - CSS-first configuration — a reimagined developer experience where you customize and extend the framework directly in CSS instead of a JavaScript configuration file.
  - CSS theme variables — all of your design tokens exposed as native CSS variables so you can access them anywhere.
  - Dynamic utility values and variants — stop guessing what values exist in your spacing scale, or extending your configuration for things like basic data attributes.
  - Modernized P3 color palette — a redesigned, more vivid color palette that takes full advantage of modern display technology.
  - Container queries — first-class APIs for styling elements based on their container size, no plugins required.
  - New 3D transform utilities — transform elements in 3D space directly in your HTML.
  - Expanded gradient APIs — radial and conic gradients, interpolation modes, and more.
  - @starting-style support — a new variant you can use to create enter and exit transitions, without the need for JavaScript.
  - not-* variant — style an element only when it doesn't match another variant, custom selector, or media or feature query.
  - Even more new utilities and variants — including support for color-scheme, field-sizing, complex shadows, inert, and more.
