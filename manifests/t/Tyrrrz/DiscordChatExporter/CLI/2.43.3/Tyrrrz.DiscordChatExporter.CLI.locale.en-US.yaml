ReleaseNotes: |-
  Announcements
  - ðŸŽ‰ âœ¨ The GUI flavor of DiscordChatExporter is now fully cross-platform! âœ¨ ðŸŽ‰
  - Release assets are now separate for each platform.
  - You no longer need to use dotnet DiscordChatExporter.Cli.dll to run the CLI version of DiscordChatExporter on Linux, but can run ./DiscordChatExporter.Cli directly.
  - On MacOS, you still need to run the app with dotnet DiscordChatExporter.dll (GUI) or dotnet DiscordChatExporter.Cli.dll (CLI).
  - You may need to run chmod +x DiscordChatExporter or chmod +x DiscordChatExporter.Cli after downloading on Linux/macOS, this should be fixed in the next release.
  - Note that the DiscordChatExporter.zip asset is equivalent to DiscordChatExporter.win-x64.zip and is uploaded only for backwards-compatibility with the auto-updater.
