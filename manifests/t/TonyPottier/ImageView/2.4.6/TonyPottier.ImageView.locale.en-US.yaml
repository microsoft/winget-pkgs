ShortDescription: The free and open-source image viewer for Microsoft Windows
Description: |-
  ImageView is a free and open-source image viewer for Microsoft Windows.
  It focuses primarily on ease of use and aims to remain lightweight.
Moniker: imageview
Tags:
- image
- viewer
- image-viewer
ReleaseNotes: |-
  - First of all, the drawing logic has been displaced in a custom PictureBox control that handles everything.
    ImageView is basically the PictureBox control "with some UI stuff around it".
  - The code logic has been separated from the UI as much as possibly by pushing it aside in a "State" class.
    This is a much better and cleaner solution than what was there before (a hot mess of code in the windows form class file)
  New features
  - HEIC support (Apple's new default image format in IOS).
    This was already baked in ImageMagick but not officially supported in ImageView. (#19)
  Bug Fixes
  - Images with alpha channels not displaying properly (#18)
  - Changing language resets the status bar (#16)
  Other changes
  - All dlls are now under a /lib subfolder (#22)
  Known issues
  - Pixel Coordinates are wrong above 32767 (#1)
  Todo
  - Support for multi page ICOs
  - Support for animated GIFs
  - Browse palette of images when available
  - Add a check for updates functionality
  - Manage file associations directly from settings
  - File Deletion: Add a switch based on the configuration to move to recycle bin by default instead of deleting.
  - File Deletion: In case of AunauthorizedAccessException prompt user to restart the app in admin mode
  - If a picture was moved while browsing a folder, recover gracefully by attempting to load the previous or next image
  - Custom toolbar (pick what tools should be seen and in which order)
