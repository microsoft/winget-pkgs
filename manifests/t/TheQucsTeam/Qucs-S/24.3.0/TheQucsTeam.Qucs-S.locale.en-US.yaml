ShortDescription: Qucs-S is a circuit simulation program with Qt-based GUI
Description: Qucs-S is a circuit simulation program based onQucs circuit simulator. The "S" letter indicates SPICE. The purpose of the Qucs-S project is to use free SPICE circuit simulation kernels with the GUI based on Qt toolkit. It merges the power of SPICE and the simplicity of the Qucs GUI.

  Qucs-S 24.3.0
  New features
  - SpiceLibComp redesign. This device is renamed to Spice Library Device and provides an easy way to add SPICE model to schematic and assign symbol to it. See #679
  - Added possibity to import SPICE model for Diode, BJT, MOSFET, and JFET unified devices (blue) #795
  - Implemeted symbol files (*.sym) editing mode. These files are needed to attach symbol to SPICE devices #700
  - Redesign of schematic rendering engine. Improve rendering quality on HiDPI displays #723
  - Improved Qucsconv GUI to reflect new converter features #826
  - Improved libraries portability, relative path support for libraries, show libraries from project directory #567
  - Added a global setting for Ngspice compatibility mode (LTspice, HSPICE, etc.) #851
  - Add global Ngspice compatibility mode (LTspice/HSPICE/S3) setting #851
  - QucsatorRF updated to version 1.0.1
  Deprecated features
  - The *.qucs binary archives are not supported anymore. Use system archivers to pack the projects instead #811
  - The SweepModel property of Parameter Sweep simulaiton has been deprecated. It is not needed anymore after Ngspice has added variable sweep feature. Use variable sweep instead #839
  - Toolbars and status bar made always visible #852
  - Icons theme settings removed from settings dialog. These settings have no effect since v2.1.0 when unified and auto-generated icons were introduced.
  Packaging
  - Linux DEB and RPM packages switched to Qt6
  - Windows package switched to Qt6
  - Introduced continous release of Linux, Windows, and Mac packages #719
  - Added MacOS package build #797 and homebrew support #804
  General improvements
  - The TEMP and TEMPER variables are recognized by parameter sweep to apply temperature sweep #816
  - Fixed ASCO optimization with QucsatorRF #830
  - Enabled variables as parameters for unified nonlinear devices and pulsed source #838 and #808
  - Fixed issues with XYCE simulation #701
  - Improved attenuator synthesis tool #722
  - Improved filter synthesis tool #715 #673
  - Redesign File->Open examples menu. Show open dialog instead of file manager #672
  - Qucs-S now follows XDG standard for cached data location #145
  - Apply .OPTION INTERP when simulating transient with parameter sweep; prevent broken par. sweep data #766
  - Implemented relative paths support for library devices #567
  Component library
  - Added PWM controllers (TL494, UC384x, etc.) library #846
  - Added Germanium diodes library #846
  - Added Mixer IC library containing SA612 model #846
  - Added Diodes extended library containing different USSR diodes models
  - Added new Varactor library #759
  - Added new PIN diode library #764
  Localization
  - Russian translation update
