ShortDescription: Qucs-S is a circuit simulation program with Qt-based GUI
Description: Qucs-S is a circuit simulation program based onQucs circuit simulator. The "S" letter indicates SPICE. The purpose of the Qucs-S project is to use free SPICE circuit simulation kernels with the GUI based on Qt toolkit. It merges the power of SPICE and the simplicity of the Qucs GUI.
