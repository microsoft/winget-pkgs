ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Task now includes built-in core utilities to greatly improve compatibility on Windows. This means that your commands that uses cp, mv, mkdir or any other common core utility will now work by default on Windows, without extra setup. This is something we wanted to address for many many years, and it's finally being shipped! Read our blog post about this topic. (#197, #2360 by @andreynering).
  - ✨ Built and deployed a brand new website using VitePress (#2359, #2369, #2371, #2375, #2378 by @vmaerten, @andreynering, @pd93).
  - Began releasing nightly builds. This will allow people to test our changes before they are fully released and without having to install Go to build them (#2358 by @vmaerten).
  - Added support for global config files in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/task/taskrc.yml or $HOME/.taskrc.yml. Check out our new configuration guide for more details (#2247, #2380, #2390, #2391 by @vmaerten, @pd93).
  - Added experiments to the taskrc schema to clarify the expected keys and values (#2235 by @vmaerten).
  - Added support for new properties in .taskrc.yml: insecure, verbose, concurrency, remote offline, remote timeout, and remote expiry. ⚠️ Note: setting offline via environment variable is no longer supported. (#2389 by @vmaerten)
  - Added a --nested flag when outputting tasks using --list --json. This will output tasks in a nested structure when tasks are namespaced (#2415 by @pd93).
  - Enhanced support for tasks with wildcards: they are now logged correctly, and wildcard parameters are fully considered during fingerprinting (#1808, #1795 by @vmaerten).
  - Fixed panic when a variable was declared as an empty hash ({}) (#2416, #2417 by @trulede).
  Package API
  - Bumped the minimum version of Go to 1.24 (#2358 by @vmaerten).
  Other news
  We recently released our official GitHub Action. This is based on the fantastic work by the Arduino team who created and maintained the community version. Now that this is officially adopted, fixes/updates should be more timely. We have already merged a couple of longstanding PRs in our first release (by @pd93, @shrink, @trim21 and all the previous contributors to arduino/setup-task).
  NOTE: v3.45.0-v3.45.2 were skipped due to issues with our release process.
