ShortDescription: '100% Open Source Toolkit for Large Language Models: Train, Tune, Chat on your own Machine'
Description: Transformer Lab is a free, open-source LLM workspace that you can run on your own computer. It is designed to go beyond what most modern open LLM applications allow. Using Transformer Lab you can easily finetune, evaluate, export and test LLMs across different inference engines and platforms.
