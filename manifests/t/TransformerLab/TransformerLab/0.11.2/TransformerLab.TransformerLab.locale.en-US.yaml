ShortDescription: '100% Open Source Toolkit for Large Language Models: Train, Tune, Chat on your own Machine'
Description: Transformer Lab is a free, open-source LLM workspace that you can run on your own computer. It is designed to go beyond what most modern open LLM applications allow. Using Transformer Lab you can easily finetune, evaluate, export and test LLMs across different inference engines and platforms.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Highlights
  - AirLLM for MLX: run models larger than your available GPU memory!
  - Fastchat server: Gemma3 support, and Evaluate logprobs now works
  - Embeddings: correctly uses selected embedding model, several fixes to training plugin
  - Ollama Server is the now the default server plugin for users without a GPU or MLX
  Specific additions to Evaluations:
  - Custom evals: create your own evals using custom python code
  - Red Teaming Plugin: generate detailed reports of potential vulnerabilities in your LLMs
  - GEval: Enter a description to DeepEval LLM-as-Judge to create an evaluation metric for you automatically
