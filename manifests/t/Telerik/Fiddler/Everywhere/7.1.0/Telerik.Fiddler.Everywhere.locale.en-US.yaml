ReleaseNotes: |-
  New
  - Add compact tables view for session list, composer and inspectors to reduce row height and fit more data on the screen. Go to Settings > Appearance to switch between Default and Compact view.
  - Add support for parsing messages in server-sent events (SSE) sessions using HTTP/1.1

  Fixed
  - Error "Invalid session id/session source id" displayed when Fiddler works in the background
  - Email validation requires additional clicks when sharing resources with other users
  - The content-type header in composer requests gets duplicated in some cases
  - Scrolling inspectors view with small app window sometimes hides the session body contents
  - Update third-party dependencies to mitigate potential security vulnerabilities
