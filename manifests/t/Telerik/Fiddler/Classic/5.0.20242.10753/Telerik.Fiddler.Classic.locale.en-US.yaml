ShortDescription: The Original and Free Web Debugging Proxy Tool Exclusively for Windows
Description: |-
  Fiddler is a Web Debugging Proxy which logs all HTTP(S) traffic between your computer and the Internet.
  Fiddler allows you to inspect all HTTP(S) traffic, set breakpoints, and "fiddle" with incoming or outgoing data. Fiddler includes a powerful event-based scripting subsystem, and can be extended using any .NET language.
  Fiddler is freeware and can debug traffic from virtually any application, including Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, and thousands more.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  features:
   Show informational banners in cases where some functionalities are not supported
   Add tls1.1 and tls1.2 in the default HTTPS supported protocols for decryption (for new installations only)

  fixes:
   Changing fonts breaks the TextView tab by hiding the search option
   Saving SAZ file fails when there are more than 62K sessions
   Check for update fails when tls1.2 is not added in the HTTPS supported protocols
   Host Remapping tool fails to override certificate behavior for requests created by Fiddler Classic
   Export as cURL uses -d instead of --data-raw which causes security issues in some rare cases
   An unnecessary log is printed when ClientHello's length is greater than 255 bytes
