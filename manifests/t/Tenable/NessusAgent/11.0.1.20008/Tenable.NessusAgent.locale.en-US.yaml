  Supported Platforms
  The following are supported platform updates made in Tenable Agent 11.0.1:
  - Tenable Agent now supports Red Hat Enterprise Linux 10.
  Upgrade Notes
  - Some fixes in Tenable Agent 11.0.1 were originally planned for the Tenable Agent 11.0.0 release. Because Tenable submitted version 11.0.0 for NIAP certification, no code changes could be made to that build. As a result, Tenable Agent 11.0.1 is the first release in the Tenable Agent 11 series.
  - You can upgrade to the latest version of Tenable Agent from any previously supported version.
  - If your upgrade path skips versions of the Tenable Agent, Tenable recommends reviewing the release notes for all skipped versions to learn about new features and bug fixes.
  - If you are connecting to Tenable Vulnerability Management through Tenable Nessus scanners, Tenable Agents, Tenable Web App Scanning scanners, or Tenable Network Monitors (NNM) located in mainland China, you must connect through sensor.cloud.tenablecloud.cn instead of sensor.cloud.tenable.com.
