  Changed Functionality and Performance Enhancements

  The following changes are included in Tenable Nessus 10.11.1:
  - Tenable Nessus Manager Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Plugin Optimization — Added support for Tenable Nessus Manager to generate plugin databases for RHEL-derived distributions. This update will allow agents 11.1.0 and later to retrieve only the plugins specific to their Linux distribution.
    Note: Tenable Nessus Manager now produces plugin databases for pre-11.1.0 and post-11.1.0 agents, which requires additional storage space and time for processing plugins. For more information, see the Tenable Nessus Manager Hardware Requirements.
  Security Updates
  The following are security updates included in Tenable Nessus 10.11.1:
  - Updated libxml2 to version 2.13.9.
  - Updated libxslt to version 1.1.45.
  - Updated expat to version 2.7.3.
    For more information, see the Tenable Product Security Advisory.

  - If your upgrade path skips versions of Tenable Nessus, Tenable recommends reviewing the release notes for all skipped versions to learn about new features and bug fixes.
  - If you want your scanners to update to the newest version before the GA date automatically, set your Tenable Nessus Update Plan to Opt in to Early Access releases.
  - If you want to update your scanners to the latest version before the GA date manually, disable automatic updates so the scanner does not automatically downgrade to the previous version.
