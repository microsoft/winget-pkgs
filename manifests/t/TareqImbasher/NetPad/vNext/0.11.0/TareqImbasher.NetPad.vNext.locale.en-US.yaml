ReleaseNotes: |-
  If you like NetPad, please star the repo 🌟 and consider sponsoring FOSS!
  This release adds .NET 10 support, some new features, and a new CLI tool! All feedback is welcome.
  🎯 A special thanks to Andrea Bondanini (@sbundaz) for contributing a number of new features in this release.
  What's New 🚀
  .NET 10 Support
  .NET 10 SDK is now supported. New scripts will automatically target .NET 10 if you have it installed.
  Oracle Data Connections
  You can now create Oracle database connections. Thanks to Andrea Bondanini (@sbundaz) for the contribution.
  IL Viewer
  NetPad now has an IL Viewer. You can find it by opening the Code pane located at the bottom left, and then swithcing from Syntax Viewer to IL Viewer.
  Thanks to Andrea Bondanini (@sbundaz) for helping with this.
  User Secrets Manager
  A User Secrets management pane was added to the bottom pane ribbon. Secrets can be accessed in your code using Util.Secrets:
  string value = Util.Secrets.Get("secretkey");
  You can also list/add/update/remove secrets directly from code using these methods on Util.Secrets:
  void Save("secretkey", "value");
  UserSecret[] List();
  UserSecret? GetSecret(string key);
  bool Delete(string key);
  void Delete(Func<UserSecret, bool> filter);
  Wiki page
  NetPad CLI (npad)
  npad is a new CLI tool that brings NetPad to the terminal. You can use it to execute scripts, standalone C# files, and even code you type on the command prompt directly.
  It can be installed as a dotnet tool:
  dotnet tool install -g netpad.cli
  See the wiki page for usage and examples.
  The following is planned for npad:
  1. Faster script execution. The first time you run a script it is built and cached. Subsequent runs are much faster. The goal is to speed up that initial run.
  2. Ability to pass arguments to your scripts.
  3. Build a script into an executable.
  npad will have a different release cycle than NetPad (GUI), and will see some frequent updates in the near future with CLI-specific features and enhancements.

    - A small refresh to tabs and panes.
    - App status messages in the statusbar can be dismissed by right-clicking the message.
    - Better UI for errors in the output pane for better readability.
    - Changed the formatting of how long a script took to run on the bottom left.
    - Swap the order of the Settings and Pin Window icons in the titlebar.
  - Update OmniSharp to v1.39.15.
  Fixes 🐛
  - Fix OmniSharp doesn't perform 2nd Quick Fix suggestion (#365).
  - Fix bug that caused script output to no show after manually stopping a script.
  - Fix Optimize dropdown not show actual selected value.
  Installers
  NetPad has 2 release channels:
  - Stable: The Electron version of NetPad. Installers that start with netpad
  - vNext: Uses a native Rust-based shell. Installers that start with netpad_vnext
  Both channels have the same feature set and are equally maintained. The native vNext version is lighter on system resources and planned to become the main package. At which point, the Electron version might be deprecated.
  See wiki for more info.
