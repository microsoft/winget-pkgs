ReleaseNotes: |-
  If you like NetPad, please star the repo üåü and consider sponsoring FOSS!
  üéØ A special thanks to @jesterret and @Jogai for contributing a number of new features and fixes in this release.
  [!NOTE]
  NetPad has a new Wiki: https://tareqimbasher.github.io/NetPad which also includes some early technical documentation. The current GitHub wiki is out of date and will be removed soon.
  What's New üöÄ
  Export Data Connections
  You can now scaffold a database connection and export it to a C# project by right-clicking a connection and selecting "Scaffold to C# Project". This can be a great way to jump start a new app, or build an assembly to use in your own applications.
  Vim Keybindings (experimental)
  The editor now has vim support (#238). It can be enabled by:
  - Going to Settings > Editor
  - Keyboard shortcut (Alt + V). Keybinding can be changed in Settings.
  This functionality is mainly powered by monaco-vim which uses CodeMirror's implementation behind the scenes.
  Future Plans
  I plan to add the following in future releases:
  - Command history (pressing up/down arrows for command history).
  - More keybindings and commands that target the application interface and not just text editing; example: selecting a connection.
  Feedback Requested
  This is an experimental feature. I'd love to hear your feedback and comments on issues or ways to make it better. The monaco-vim library isn't very well maintained unfortunately but I wanted to try it out before rolling my own.
  User Interface
  - When NetPad opens, it now restores all open scripts from the last session. Previously, only unsaved scripts were restored (#336).
  - Scripts in the Explorer pane are sorted case-insensitive (#344).
  - New spinner icon for when a script is running.
  - New alert dialogs.
  - Native select file dialogs instead of HTML file inputs.
  Scripts
  - Source Generator support (#233). Thanks to @jesterret
  - Support for .NET framework version preprocessor symbols. You can now use preprocessor symbols like NET8_0_OR_GREATER in your scripts. More info. Thanks to @jesterret
  - Dump() now hides indexer properties (#349).
  - New async versions of Dump() (#326). Thanks to @jesterret
  App Updates
  - NetPad is updated to .NET 9.
  - Electron updated to v36 by switching from Electron.NET (still on Electron v23) to ElectronSharp (a fork of Electron.NET) which brings a number of security fixes and performance improvements. Special thanks to @Jogai for putting alot of work into making this happen.
  - Node.js updated to v22.
  - Code:
    - Improved thread-safety.
    - Fixed some memory leaks.
    - Performance improvements.
    - Code cleanup, fixed some warnings and more code documentation.
  Fixes üêõ
  - Fixed OmniSharp not starting, and Intellisense not working, (most commonly on macOS).
  - Fix Dump() for properties on derived types (#323). Thanks to @jesterret
  - Fix inability to browse & select an assembly to reference in vNext (#331).
  - Fixed OmniSharp code diagnostics not resetting after user restarts OmniSharp server from Command Palette > Developer: Restart OmniSharp Server.
  - Fixed Electron selecting the wrong button when Esc is pressed on some dialogs.
  Next Minor Version (v0.10.1)
  v0.10.1 is in the works and will include .NET 10 Preview SDK support as well as fixes for some bugs that I didn't get a chance to address in this release.
  Installers
  NetPad has 2 release channels:
  - Stable: The Electron version of NetPad. Installers that start with netpad
  - vNext: Uses a native Rust-based shell. Installers that start with netpad_vnext
  Both channels have the same feature set and are equally maintained. The native vNext version is lighter on system resources and planned to become the main package. At which point, the Electron version might be deprecated.
  See wiki for more info.
  Support ‚ù§Ô∏è
  If you're enjoying NetPad and would like to support open-source, please consider sponsoring the project, it really
  helps! Also don't forget to star the repo if you haven't already, thank you!
  A special thanks to all my sponsors. Your support is greatly appreciated and helps keep this project growing!
