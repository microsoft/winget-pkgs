ShortDescription: Quick and Easy Wake On LAN Utility.
Description: |-
  The intend of miniWOL is to have a small icon in your SysTray (Windows) or Menubar (Linux and MacOS X),
  where you can send a Wake On LAN magic packet to a defined server. All this without thinking or seeing
  all the in-depth details (once you’ve configured it right).
ReleaseNotes: |-
  Some fixes and features:

  For all platforms:
  – Added option to execute a script after sending a Wake On LAN
  – Update on how the controls are positioned in the Settings window

  For macOS/Windows:
  – Added the option to send a Wake On LAN to devices when your PC/Mac wakes up from sleep

  For Windows/Linux:
  – Added the option to invert the icon in the system tray (previously existed for Linux already)

  For Windows:
  – Setup now allows to install miniWOL on a portable device – no longer a separate installer needed
    for using the application as a portable app.
