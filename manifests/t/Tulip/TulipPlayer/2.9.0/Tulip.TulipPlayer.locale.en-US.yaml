  Play Tulip apps on machines, tablets, computers, and phones. Enable powerful, consumer-grade user experiences for your workforce across devices
  The Tulip Player windows application, offers an extended set of features:
  A more immersive user experience:
  - The Tulip Player Windows App will persist its window size, position, and full screen state across restarts. This can be helpful if you always want your Tulip Player to appear in the same position, or to always be maximized.
  - The Tulip Player Windows App is a dedicated user experience. It can only be used to access Tulip Apps - not Facebook.
  Better hardware access:
  - The Tulip Player Windows App supports Tulip Vision
  - It can open files from the local computer within your Tulip App.
  - In some situations, hardware barcode scanners will work better.
  - It supports a wide range of hardware devices which can be found here
  Better authentication experience:
  - Administrators only have to authenticate the Tulip Player Windows App once per physical computer. In contrast, the Tulip Web Player has to be authenticated separately for each operator. In some situations, shareable station links can be used to work around this limitation.
  - For the the Tulip Player Windows App, credentials are securely persisted to the file system. This makes it harder for an operator to accidentally de-register their station, which would require an administrator to re-register them.
  - The Tulip Player Windows App can be registered with multiple Tulip instances, making it easier to switch between a staging and production instance, for example.
  - The Tulip Player Windows App and the Tulip App Editor can be used simultaneously. You must sign out of the App Editor in order to access the Tulip Web Player.
  Diagnostics:
  - The Tulip Player Windows App makes logs easier to access.
  - The Tulip Player Windows App can collect more detailed information about the computer it’s running on.
ReleaseNotes: |-

  Version 2.9.0 of Desktop Player will be available for download by 9:00PM ET tomorrow (October 4th, 2025)! If you have auto updates enabled, the Desktop Player application will update in the background and changes will take effect the next time the application is restarted.

  Feature Enhancements
  - Adds Player support for a torque multi tool driver.
  - We now have retry logic for async snapshot and video recordings, and if it fails, we now save the file locally.
  - In Player, a warning will be shown if a user attempts to close Player while triggers are still executing.
  - On the TorqueOP, the torqueOP driver now allows you to select job numbers greater than 99.
  - For Edge Drivers, the Phidgets SDK is added for Edge Drivers. The cloud side changes will be added in the next few releases to allow users to use the driver/
  Bug Fixes
  - Fixed a bug for the image or video capture feature in Vision. Now, there are "snapshotUploadFailed" and "videoUploadFailed" events that will display a message if related events (e.g. Start image capture, Start image capture of a Region, Record a video clip, or Record a video clip of a Region) fail to upload the captured image or video.
  - Fixed an issue where the desktop player would navigate away from player app when clicking on hyperlinks in the document viewer. The links should now open on the default browser.
  - Fixes issue where custom edge drivers were not starting.
  End of Support for Mac Intel Processor
  - Player 2.9.0 will be the last release that will be supported for Mac Intel Processor. This change impacts less than .08% of all interfaces and users who are impacted will be notified. See the community post here
