ReleaseNotes: |-
  v0.94.0
  Caution
  For (advanced) manual setups only: Following a tooling change, the main entry point has changed from main.js to main.cjs. Same goes for the Electron build.
  Important
  If you enjoyed this release, consider showing a token of appreciation by:
  - Pressing the ‚ÄúStar‚Äù button on GitHub (top-right).
  - Considering a one-time or recurrent donation to the lead developer via GitHub Sponsors or PayPal.
  üí° Key highlights
  - A huge amount of work was done by @perfectra1n to integrate LLMs such as Ollama and ChatGPT into Trilium.
    - The goal is not to have basic API integration, but to really let the LLM understand the notes that are part of your knowledge base.
    - For more information, consult the in-app User Guide (F1) and look for the AI section.
    - Since this is highly experimental work, the LLM chat functionality might work well or it might have quite a few quirks, please keep this in mind.
  - This release brings significant updates to our libraries:
    - CKEditor, used by text notes is now updated to the latest version and that brings in new features (see below) and performance improvements.
    - CodeMirror, used by code notes has been upgraded to a new generation.
    - Code notes now also support themes, similar to code blocks.
  üêû Bugfixes
  - Inconsistent Find and Replace Behavior in Large Code Notes by @SiriusXT
  - Incorrect import of multiple inline math by @SiriusXT
  - Random EPERM: operation not permitted on Windows
  - The update button is sometimes blank by @SiriusXT
  - Unable to handle multi line mathematical formulas when importing markdown by @SiriusXT
  - Calendar: became invisible if resizing while not visible
  - GPX track not rendering on geomap note
  - GPX icons not working
  ‚ú® Improvements
  - Improved the text editor style, to match the TriliumNext.
  - Footnotes work in image captions by @werererer
  - Improvements to text notes (see the in-app help for more details):
    - Bookmarks, similar to HTML anchors.
    - Emojis.
  - Make it show which node triggered the event when right-clicking on tree by @SiriusXT
  - Only expand/collapse the left pane of the focused window by @SiriusXT
  - Code notes:
    - Added the GDScript (Godot) language for both code notes and code blocks in text notes.
    - Added the Nix language (and also in code blocks for text notes).
    - Added an indentation marker.
    - Note: syntax highlighting for some languages (mostly HTML-template languages such as EJS, JSP) is no longer supported due to lack of upstream support. If this is a problem, feel free to report an issue and we can see what can be done about it.
  - Added support for additional syntax highlighting for code blocks in text notes: Cypher, XML-DTD, Jinja2, ClojureScript, Perl, Scala, Scheme, Swift, SystemVerilog, mIRC, Cobol, Dylan, RPM Specfile, TCCN3.
  - Mermaid diagrams: basic syntax highlight (not all diagram types are supported) and code folding.
  - Slight organization in Appearance settings: code block themes are now in "Text Notes", added a "Related settings" section in Appearance.
  - Added support for opening and activating a note in a new tab using Ctrl+Shift+click on notes in the launcher pane, note tree, or note images by @SiriusXT
  - Style and footnote improvements by @SiriusXT
  - Backend log: disable some editor features in order to increase performance for large logs (syntax highlighting, folding, etc.).
  - Collapsible table of contents by @SiriusXT
  - Sessions (logins) are no longer stored as files in the data directory, but as entries in the database. This improves the session reliability on Windows platforms.
  - Code blocks in text notes:
    - For editable notes, clicking on a code block will reveal a toolbar with a way to easily change the programming language and another button to copy the text to clipboard.
    - For read-only notes, a floating button allows copying the code snippet to clipboard.
  - Math in text notes: equations can now be displayed on multiple lines by @SiriusXT
  - Metrics endpoint by @perfectra1n
  - Docker: Rootless Dockerfiles are now available by @perfectra1n
  - Text notes: add a way to move up and down text lines via a keyboard shortcut by @dogfuntom
  - improve tab scroll UX by switching from instant to smooth behavior by @SiriusXT
  - Calendar view: display calendar view if #viewType=calendar is set.
  - Mind map: add search support by @SiriusXT
  - Geo map:
    - The name, icon and color of the track note are displayed as the starting point.
    - Added a distinct icon for the end marker.

  üåç Internationalization
  - [‚Ä¶]
  üõ†Ô∏è Technical updates
