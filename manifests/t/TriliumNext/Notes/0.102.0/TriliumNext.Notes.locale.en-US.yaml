ReleaseNotes: |-
  v0.102.0
  Important
  LLM integration was removed due to the complexity of maintaining this feature. For more information, see #8797. This means that the database needs migration (downgrades will not be possible without restoring from backup), but it will not affect the sync with the server.
  Note
  If you enjoyed this release, consider showing a token of appreciation by:
  - Pressing the “Star” button on GitHub (top-right).

  💡 Key highlights
  - Trilium now has support for custom icon packs that can be used for note icons. See Icon Packs - User Guide for more info and a list of official icon packs.
  - New layout now provides a save indicator near the note title.
  - Trilium now uses its own PDF renderer (based on PDF.js viewer from Mozilla). This allows for more features such as annotations, search (within the current file), filling forms as well as remembering last reading position. See documentation for more info.
  - Some Collections will hide their children in the note tree by default. See the documentation for details.
  - jQuery has been updated to v4.0.0 which introduces breaking changes that could potentially affect your scripts.
