ReleaseNotes: |-
  v0.101.1
  Note
  This is a hotfix for yesterday's release, which marked the 8-year anniversary of Trilium, celebrating its first public release on December 25th, 2017.
  Important
  If you enjoyed this release, consider showing a token of appreciation by:
  - Pressing the “Star” button on GitHub (top-right).
  - Considering a one-time or recurrent donation to the lead developer via GitHub Sponsors or PayPal.
  💡 Key highlights
  - A new layout was introduced which heavily changes both existing UI elements, as well as adds some new ones (by @eliandoran and @adoriandoran, with special thanks for @rom1dep for the valuable suggestions).
    - The goal of this new layout is to modernize the application and to make it more intuitive but at the same time to reduce clutter.
    - See documentation of the changes and the new UI elements.
    - Notes can be more easily navigated across the hierarchy using the breadcrumbs displayed underneath the tab bar.
    - The old layout can still be used, for now. Feedback is welcome.
  - Near the tab bar now there are built-in buttons to go the previous or the next note in history (only if the back/forward buttons are not already placed in the launch bar).
  - Scripting overhaul: Custom widgets and Render note can now be written in Preact using JSX instead of the legacy format (jQuery + custom component framework). For more information, see documentation on Preact in Trilium.

    - The toast/notification system.
  - Add dev shell and direnv support by @yzx9 and @contributor
  - Minor breaking change: custom widgets using the typo node-detail-pane will not be supported anymore. Use note-detail-pane instead.

  🔒️ Security fixes
