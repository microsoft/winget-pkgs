  Changes from v0.97.0
  üí° Key highlights
  - ‚ÄúBooks‚Äù have been renamed to Collections to better match their intentions.
    - A new collection was introduced, table.
      - See the in-app documentation for more information.
      - Custom table theme for Trilium by @adoriandoran
    - Geomap: The geomap was converted from a standalone note type to a collection.
    - The collections are not displayed directly in ‚ÄúInsert child‚Äù in the note tree with predefined configuration such as promoted attributes to make them easier to use (e.g. for calendar, geomap).
  - A new editing mechanism was introduced: quick edit. This opens notes for editing in a popup instead of a tab, allowing easy access. This is especially useful for collections, to edit notes without switching context.
  üêû Bugfixes
  - Missing note meta. Can't export empty note and involved note tree
  - Mermaid notes sluggish
  - In-app help confusing due to ligatures
  - Geo map: tooltip not showing.
  - Nix flake support broke with electron 37 upgrade
  - Signing on Windows did not work on the previous release.
  - When editing a note in Linux, middle-clicking a note title in tree pane triggers a paste action
  - Editor not focused after switching tabs.
  - PDF file preview: inconvenient 10px scrollable margin at the bottom.
  - Calendar view:
    - Subtree children not displayed when in calendar root.
    - Title changes to events not reflected.
  - Attributes Dialogue Doesn't Display for existing attributes
  - Issues on Prometeus dashboard due to timestamps
  - Ckeditor (re)-creation likely causes important lagging when coming from code note

    - Improve error handling
    - Improve handling of notes with empty title.

    - Adding markers by drag & dropping from note tree.
    - Read-only mode to prevent modification such as dragging.
