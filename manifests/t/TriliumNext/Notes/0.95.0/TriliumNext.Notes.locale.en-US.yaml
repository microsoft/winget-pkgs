ReleaseNotes: |-
  v0.95.0
  Important
  If you enjoyed this release, consider showing a token of appreciation by:
  - Pressing the ‚ÄúStar‚Äù button on GitHub (top-right).
  - Considering a one-time or recurrent donation to the lead developer via GitHub Sponsors or PayPal.
  Caution
  Sync version has been increased, so update of both the client and server are necessary.
  Important
  For canvas notes, the ‚ÄúMermaid to Excalidraw‚Äù feature is no longer functional for now since it relies on an old version of Mermaid diagrams. To avoid having a large library duplicated, we had to let go of this feature. If it's an important feature to you, let us know.
