ReleaseNotes: |-
  To receive further updates for a non-docker installation, please change the branch to master. (Settings -> General (Show Advanced Settings) -> Updates -> Branch)
  If you are using docker you will need to update the container image. Do not attempt to update Lidarr within an existing docker container. Doing so will prevent audio fingerprinting from working and break your Lidarr installation if you ever delete and re-create the container.
