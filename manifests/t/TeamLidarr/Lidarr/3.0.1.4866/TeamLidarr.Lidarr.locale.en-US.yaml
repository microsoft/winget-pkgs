  BREAKING CHANGE: SQLite SourceGear Migration Compatibility
  SQLite has migrated to SourceGear.sqlite3, which requires GLIBC 2.29+ and is incompatible with older end-of-life systems including Debian 10, Synology DSM, and Ubuntu 18.04. If you encounter SQLite-related errors, symlink libe_sqlite3.so to the application’s bin directory from your system’s native SQLite library instead. See the FAQ for details.
  To receive further updates for a non-docker installation, please change the branch to master. (Settings -> General (Show Advanced Settings) -> Updates -> Branch)
  If you are using docker you will need to update the container image. Do not attempt to update Lidarr within an existing docker container. Doing so will prevent audio fingerprinting from working and break your Lidarr installation if you ever delete and re-create the container.
