ReleaseNotes: |-
  This release add Undo and Redo, which is handy after making a mistake in placement. The backslash key now shows and hides the row and column lines, while ctrl-backslash does the same to the background image. Closing the main window will now exit the application. A Strings dialog lists strings in the ROM, and double clicking one will select it in the Hex viewer.
  The biggest change is a rewrite of the alignment algorithm. The old algorithm first identified the leftmost column and then populated each row by placing bits into linked lists growing out of that column. The new algorithm grows those lists even if the left column is not yet complete, which dramatically improves reliability and abandons all the janky workarounds for perfectly vertical images.
