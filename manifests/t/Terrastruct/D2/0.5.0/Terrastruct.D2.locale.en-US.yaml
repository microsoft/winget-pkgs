ReleaseNotes: |-
  Features üöÄ
  - D2 files have the ability to import from other D2 files. See docs. #1371
  - sql_table alternatively takes an array of constraints instead of being limited to a single one. Thanks @satoqz ! #1245
  Improvements üßπ
  - Use shape-specific sizing for grid containers #1294
  - Grid diagrams support nested shapes or grid diagrams #1309
  - grid-gap, vertical-gap, and horizontal-gap apply to padding on grid diagrams #1309
  - Watch mode browser uses an error favicon to easily indicate compiler errors.
    Thanks @sinyo-matu ! #1240
  - Grid layout performance improved when there are many similarly sized shapes #1315
  - Connections and labels are adjusted for shapes with 3d or multiple #1340
  - Constraints in sql_table render even if they have no matching abbreviation #1372
  - Constraints in sql_table sheds their excessive letter-spacing and is padded from the end consistently #1372
  - Duplicate image URLs in icons are only fetched once #1373
  - In watch mode, images are cached by default across compiles.
    Can be disabled with flag --img-cache=0. #1373
  - Common invalid array separator , usage in class arrays returns a helpful error message #1376
  - Invalid constraint usage is met with an error message, preventing a common mistake of omitting shape: sql_table #1379
  - Connections no longer obscure outside labels #1381
  - Container connections in dagre are more balanced #1384
  - Connections that go through shape labels are now masked translucently #1383
  Bugfixes ‚õëÔ∏è
  - Shadow is no longer cut off when --pad is 0.
    Thank you @LeonardsonCC ! #1326
  - Fixes grid layout overwriting label placements for nested objects #1345
  - Fixes fonts not rendering correctly on certain platforms.
    Thanks @mikeday for identifying the solution. #1356
  - Fixes folders not rendering in animations (--animate-interval) #1357
  - Fixes panic using reserved keywords as containers #1358
  - When multiple classes are change different attributes of arrowheads, they are
  - Prevent empty block strings #1364
  - Fixes dagre mis-aligning a nested shape's connection #1370
  - Fixes a bug in grids sometimes putting a shape on the next row/column #1380
  Breaking changes
  - @xyz is now reserved as a pattern for imports. If you previously had a key that started like that, it must either be renamed or quoted like "@xyz".
  - Likewise with ...@xyz (spread operator import)
