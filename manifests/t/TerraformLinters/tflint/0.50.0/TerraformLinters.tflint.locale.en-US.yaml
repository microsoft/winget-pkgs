  Breaking Changes
  - Call local modules by default by @wata727 in #1918
  - Module inspection is now enabled by default for modules whose source is a relative path.
    Note that "module inspection" will be called "calling modules" after this change.
    See also #1066
  - CLI flag --module has been changed to --call-module-type. For backward compatibility, --module will continue to work, but it will be removed in a future version, so we recommend migrating early.
    The same applies to the module attribute of the configuration file.
  - --module flag is replaced by --call-module-type=all and --no-module (previous default) is replaced by --call-module-type=none
  - For modules with many local module calls, this change may result in performance degradation.
    If this is not acceptable, you can keep the previous default by specifying --call-module-type=none.
  - Make assignments to undeclared variables an error by @wata727 in #1941
  - In line with Terraform behavior, assignments using the --var flag etc. to undeclared variables now result in an error.
    To avoid this, remove unnecessary variable assignments.
  Enhancements
  - Print the working directory on error in recursive inspection by @wata727 in #1933
  - Enable per-runner parallelism by @wata727 in #1944
  BugFixes
  - Exit with an error if the explicitly passed .tflint.hcl does not exist by @wata727 in #1940
