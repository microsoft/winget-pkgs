ReleaseNotes: |-
  What's Changed
  This release introduces a new configuration file format: .tflint.json. This is useful for workflows such as automatically generating configuration files.
  Please note that in order to use the .tflint.json, enabled plugins must be built with SDK v0.23+.
  From this release, Cosign signatures (checksums.txt.keyless.sig and checksums.txt.pem) are deprecated. They will not be included in future releases. If your installation scripts depend on them, please migrate to gh attestation verify.
