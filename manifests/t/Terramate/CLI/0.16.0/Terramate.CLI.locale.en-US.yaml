ShortDescription: Open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) orchestration platform
Description: |-
  Terramate CLI is an orchestration and code generation tool that enables you to unify, simplify and scale all your infrastructure code, tools and workflows.
  - Stacks: Are Infrastructure as Code tooling agnostic and isolated units used to group, deploy and manage infrastructure resources such as a single service or an entire environment.
  - Orchestration: Allows orchestrating the execution of commands such as terraform apply, kubectl apply or infracost breakdown in stacks.
  - GitOps for Infrastructure: Pre-configured and fully customizable GitOps automation workflows that run in your existing CI/CD platform.
  - Workflows: Define custom commands to combine multiple commands into one executable unit of work.
  - Configuration: Define and reuse data in stacks by using variables and metadata.
  - Code Generation: Generate code in stacks to keep your stacks DRY and to provide pre-configured templates (think of generating files such as Terraform provider configuration or Kubernetes manifests).
  - Native Infrastructure as Code: Terramate doesn't introduce any complex wrappers or abstraction layers and allows you to stay in native environments (e.g. native Terraform).
  - Unlimited Integrations: Terramate integrates with all existing tooling. OPA, Infracost, Checkov, Trivy, Terrascan, Terragrunt, etc - you name it.
