  - To better reflect our commitment to consistent innovation and improvements, Snagit's application name is now simply "Snagit" with no version number in the name. Users who are subscribed to Snagit or who receive Snagit as part of their Camtasia subscription will no longer need to download a separate Snagit installer once a year to get the latest features and improvements.
