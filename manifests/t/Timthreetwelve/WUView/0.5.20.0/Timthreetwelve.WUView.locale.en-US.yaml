ShortDescription: Windows Update Viewer (WUView) is an application that displays Windows Update history.
Description: |-
  Windows Update Viewer (WUView) is an application that displays Windows Update history.
  It is meant to be a lightweight application that is easy to use.
  There aren't any confusing categories; every update is listed in one place.
  Updates that you don't want to see can be permanently excluded or temporarily filtered.

- windows-updates
ReleaseNotes: |-
  Changes:
  - Updated: Removed the language translation files.
    For reasons I just can't figure out every time I add a language the resources.dll file is flagged as a trojan.
    If anyone has any insight as to what might be happening, please let me know.
