  New Features
  - The Remote Support window has been redesigned to a layout inspired by the Classic interface. You can now clearly distinguish if you want to receive or provide remote control. Session codes and the TeamViewer ID/password are both prominently displayed along with a list of recent connections.
  - Supporters can now join a session and wait for the user in a dedicated waiting room. This enhanced waiting room allows supporters to easily view and copy session details while awaiting connection with the user.
