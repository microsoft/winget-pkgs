  New Features
  - The remote support page has been improved to support a range of screen resolutions, including 1366 x 768, 1024 x 768, 640 x 560, and 2560 x 1440.
  - It is now possible to add, view and connect to session codes through their legacy groups on the Devices page.
  - It is now possible to restrict the use of device personal passwords via policy a setting.

  Improvements
  - The performance of fetching devices and device information has been improved. The device list and details drawer now load information more quickly.
  - The process of adding or removing managers from devices has been improved, allowing users to see more managers at once.
  - The flow of adding devices to a group has been enhanced. Users can now choose whether the devices will inherit the group policy during this process. The UI has also been updated to display more devices at once.
  - It is now possible to view and edit the device group(s) to which a device belongs directly from its information tab.
  - The tab of the device/device group side-drawer panel now remains unchanged as the user navigates through various device/device group entries.

  Bugfixes
  - Fixed a crash that occurred when loading a port forwarding configuration with no configuration selected.
  - When editing an existing rollout-setup, users will now see the device groups and policy fields populated with the groups and policy already associated with the setup.
