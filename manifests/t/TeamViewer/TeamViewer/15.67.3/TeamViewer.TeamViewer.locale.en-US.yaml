ReleaseNotes: |-
  New Features
  - Its now possible to use the AI-based TeamViewer CoPilot functionality within a session. This feature allows users to analyze remote device data, receive suggestions on IT questions, and diagnose error messages displayed on the remote screen. This feature is accessible exclusively through the new user interface and limited to connections to Windows devices.
  - Company administrators can now access user reports on the newly introduced Security Center page. This page offers an overview of security features that can be enabled to enhance protection at both the user and device levels. The initial release includes recommended settings within the user report.
  - Session Insights can now be activated for all outgoing connections at the company level. By default, logging requires end-user confirmation, but this behavior can be adjusted through access control settings.
  - The new offline filter button on the Device List page enables users to effortlessly filter out offline devices with just a single click.
  - A new column showing the installed TeamViewer version has been added to the device list. Users can now view and sort devices by version.
  - The Remote Support page now utilizes the classic ID and password layout. The option to start a connection via link is available in the Sessions tab.
  - The process of adding a remote device has been simplified. It is now possible to either bookmark the device (by saving it with its ID and password) or assign it directly to a companys account for enhanced management. When the assignment option is selected, a unique link is generated. Sharing this link will either add the device directly to the list (if TeamViewer is already installed) or download TeamViewer and then automatically add the device - all in one seamless step. In general, the assignment method provides more administrative options and improved security.
  - It is now possible for users to view contacts in the device dock.
  - Users will now have the ability to send messages directly to devices. This option will be accessible from both the command bar and device drawer.
  - Information about device eligibility criteria has been added to the DEX Essentials activation flow.

  - DEX Essentials product, previously available in web app, is now available in TeamViewer Windows desktop version.
  - It is now possible to filter by device category for all managed devices, legacy devices, contacts, legacy groups, and device groups. This makes it easier for users to manage and organize their devices effectively.
