ReleaseNotes: |-
  New Features
  - Teamviewer Remote now remembers which device group you last opened in the Advanced view, even after you restart the app or switch to other tabs. This means you can return to the same group instantly without reopening it, making it easier to continue where you left off.
  - Devices can now be easily moved between groups in the Advanced view using drag-and-drop.

  Improvements
  - Share devices and device groups: Its now easier than ever to share devices and device groups. Select individual users or user groups and assign permissions directly in a new but familiar workflow. Share replaces the previous add and remove manager options, offering a simpler, streamlined way to manage access.
  - A banner is now shown on the Permissions tab of a device to indicate when inheritance is disabled, along with a button to turn it back on.

  Bugfixes
  - Minor fixes and improvements.
