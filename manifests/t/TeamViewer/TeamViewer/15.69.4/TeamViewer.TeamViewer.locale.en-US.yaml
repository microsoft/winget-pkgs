  New Features
  - TeamViewer deployment via MSI installer now supports direct device assignment using parameters—no post-install script required.
  - Notifications for incoming session events can now be enabled in Settings, providing better accessibility support for screen reader users.
  - Offline assignment of devices: A new "--offline" parameter for shell scripts and MSI installers ensures devices are assigned to a company once they come online, improving flexibility for staged or remote deployments.
  - The device details side panel now includes a DEX Essentials view, displaying aggregated compliance data and a 30-day history of automations executed on the device.
  - Users can now customize which DEX Essentials insights are enabled on their devices. Irrelevant insights can be disabled.

  Improvements
  - It is now possible to assign a contact and legacy group when configuring a new Host module, ensuring that any resulting service cases are automatically routed to the designated user and group.
  - It is now possible to enable Session Insights for specific outgoing connections by activating the setting in both the AI settings and the configuration of a custom QuickSupport module.
  - Enhanced protection against symbolic link redirection vulnerability. (TV Security Bulletin: TV-2025-1003)

  Bugfixes
  - Fixed a bug that could prevent Session Insights from being generated automatically after a QuickSupport session.
  - Fixed a bug in the in-session chat that could cause the selected text to be incorrectly copied via the context menu.
