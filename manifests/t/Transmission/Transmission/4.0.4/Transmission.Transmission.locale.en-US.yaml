ReleaseNotes: |-
  All Platforms
  - Fixed bug in sending torrent metadata to peers. (#5460)
  - Avoid unnecessary heap memory allocations. (#5520, #5527)
  - Fixed filename collision edge case when renaming files. (#5563)
  - Fixed locale errors that broke number rounding when displaying statistics, e.g. upload / download ratios. (#5587)
  - Always use a fixed-length key query in tracker announces.
    This isn't required by the spec, but some trackers rely on that fixed length because it's common practice by other BitTorrent clients. (#5652)
  - Fixed potential Windows crash when getstdhandle() returns NULL. (#5675)
  - Fixed 4.0.0 bug where the port numbers in LDP announces are sometimes malformed. (#5825)
  - Fixed a bug that prevented editing the query part of a tracker URL. (#5871)
  - Fixed a bug where Transmission may not announce LPD on its listening interface. (#5896)
  - Made small performance improvements in libtransmission. (#5715)
  macOS Client
  - Updated code that had been using deprecated API. (#5633)

  - Fixed poor resolution of Qt application icon. (#5570)
  GTK Client
  - Fixed missing 'Remove torrent' tooltip. (#5777)
  Web Client
  - Don't show null as a tier name in the inspector's tier list. (#5462)
