ShortDescription: Transmission is a cross-platform BitTorrent client
Description: |-
  Transmission - A Fast, Easy and Free Bittorrent Client For macOS, Windows and Linux

  Transmission is designed for easy, powerful use. We've set the defaults to just work and it only takes a few clicks to configure advanced features like watch directories, bad peer blocklists, and the web interface. When Ubuntu chose Transmission as its default BitTorrent client, one of the most-cited reasons was its easy learning curve.

  Unlike many cross-platform applications, Transmission integrates seamlessly with your operating system.
  The Qt-based Windows UI has been modernized and is fully Windows 11 ready.
