ShortDescription: A new markup-based typesetting system that is powerful and easy to learn.
Description: |-
  Typst is a new markup-based typesetting system that is designed to be as powerful as LaTeX
  while being much easier to learn and use. Typst has:

  - Built-in markup for the most common formatting tasks
  - Flexible functions for everything else
  - A tightly integrated scripting system
  - Math typesetting, bibliography management, and more
  - Fast compile times thanks to incremental compilation
  - Friendly error messages in case something goes wrong
Tags:
- compiler
- markup
- typesetting
ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Bibliography management
  - New bibliography engine based on CSL (Citation Style Language).
    Ships with about 100 commonly used citation styles and can load custom .csl files
  - Added new form argument to the cite function to produce different forms of citations (e.g. for producing a citation suitable for inclusion in prose)
  - The cite function now takes only a single label/key instead of allowing multiple.
    Adjacent citations are merged and formatted according to the citation style's rules automatically.
    This works both with the reference syntax and explicit calls to the cite function. (Breaking change)
  - The cite function now takes a label instead of a string (Breaking change)
  - Added full argument to bibliography function to print the full bibliography even if not all works were cited
  - Bibliography entries can now contain Typst equations (wrapped in $..$ just like in markup), this works both for .yml and .bib bibliographies
  - The hayagriva YAML format was improved.
    See its changelog for more details. (Breaking change)
  - A few bugs with .bib file parsing were fixed
  - Removed brackets argument of cite function in favor of form
  - Visualization
  - Gradients and colors (thanks to @Dherse)
  - Added support for gradients on shapes and text

  - Added support for defining colors in more color spaces, including Oklab, Linear RGB(A), HSL, and HSV
  - Added saturate, desaturate, and rotate functions on colors
  - Added color.map module with predefined color maps that can be used with gradients
  - Rename kind function on colors to space
  - Removed to-rgba, to-cmyk, and to-luma functions in favor of a new components function
  - Improved rendering of rectangles with corner radius and varying stroke widths
  - Added support for properly clipping boxes and blocks with a border radius
  - Added background parameter to overline, underline, and strike functions
  - Fixed inaccurate color embedding in PDFs
  - Fixed ICC profile handling for images embedded in PDFs
  - Text and Layout
  - Added support for automatically adding proper pacing between CJK and Latin text (enabled by default)
  - Added support for automatic adjustment of more CJK punctuation
  - Added quote element for inserting inline and block quotes with optional attributions
  - Added raw.line element for customizing the display of individual lines of raw text, e.g. to add line numbers while keeping proper syntax highlighting
  - Added support for per-side inset customization to table function
  - Added Hungarian and Romanian translations
  - Added support for Czech hyphenation
  - Added support for setting custom smart quotes
  - The default figure separator now reacts to the currently set language and region
  - Improved line breaking of links / URLs (especially helpful for bibliographies with many URLs)
  - Improved handling of consecutive hyphens in justification algorithm
  - Fixed interaction of justification and hanging indent
  - Fixed a bug with line breaking of short lines without spaces when justification is enabled
  - Fixed font fallback for hyphen generated by hyphenation
  - Fixed handling of word joiner and other no-break characters during hyphenation
  - Fixed crash when hyphenating after an empty line
  - Fixed line breaking of composite emoji like üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà
  - Fixed missing text in some SVGs
  - Fixed font fallback in SVGs
  - Fixed behaviour of to argument on pagebreak function
  - Fixed set align(..) for equations
  - Fixed spacing around placed elements
  - Fixed coalescing of above and below spacing if given in em units and the font sizes differ
  - Fixed handling of extent parameter of underline, overline, and strike functions
  - Fixed crash for floating placed elements with no specified vertical alignment
  - Partially fixed a bug with citations in footnotes
  - Math
  - Added gap argument for vec, mat, and cases function
  - Added size argument for abs, norm, floor, ceil, and round functions
  - Added reverse parameter to cases function
  - Added support for multinomial coefficients to binom function
  - Removed rotation argument on cancel function in favor of a new and more flexible angle argument (Breaking change)
  - Added wide constant, which inserts twice the spacing of quad
  - Added csch and sech operators
  - ‚Üº, ‚áÄ, ‚Üî, and ‚ü∑ can now be used as accents
  - Added integral.dash, integral.dash.double, and integral.slash symbols
  - Added support for specifying negative indices for augmentation lines to position the line from the back
  - Fixed default color of matrix augmentation lines
  - Fixed attachment of primes to inline expressions
  - Math content now respects the text baseline setting
  - Performance
  - Fixed a bug related to show rules in templates which would effectively disable incremental compilation in affected documents
  - Micro-optimized code in several hot paths, which brings substantial performance gains, in particular in incremental compilations
  - Improved incremental parsing, which affects the whole incremental compilation pipeline
  - Added support for incremental parsing in the CLI
  - Added support for incremental SVG encoding during PDF export, which greatly improves export performance for documents with many SVG
  - Tooling and Diagnostics
  - Improved autocompletion for variables that are in-scope
  - Added autocompletion for package imports
  - Added autocompletion for labels
  - Added tooltip that shows which variables a function captures (when hovering over the equals sign or arrow of the function)
  - Diagnostics are now deduplicated
  - Improved diagnostics when trying to apply unary + or - to types that only support binary + and -
  - Error messages now state which label or citation key isn't present in the document or its bibliography
  - Fixed a bug where function argument parsing errors were shadowed by function execution errors (e.g. when trying to call array.sorted and passing the key function as a positional argument instead of a named one).
  - Export
  - Added support for configuring the document's creation date.
    If the date is set to auto (the default), the PDF's creation date will be set to the current date and time.
  - Added support for configuring document keywords
  - Generated PDFs now contain PDF document IDs
  - The PDF creator tool metadata now includes the Typst version
  - Web app
  - Added version picker to pin a project to an older compiler version (with support for Typst 0.6.0+)
  - Fixed desyncs between editor and compiler and improved overall stability
  - The app now continues to highlight the document when typing while the document is being compiled
  - Command line interface
  - Added support for discovering fonts through fontconfig
  - Now clears the screen instead of resetting the terminal
  - Now automatically picks correct file extension for selected output format
  - Now only regenerates images for changed pages when using typst watch with PNG or SVG export
  - Miscellaneous Improvements
  - Added version type and sys.version constant specifying the current compiler version.
    Can be used to gracefully support multiple versions.
  - The U+2212 MINUS SIGN is now used when displaying a numeric value, in the repr of any numeric value and to replace a normal hyphen in text mode when before a digit.
    This improves, in particular, how negative integer values are displayed in math mode.
  - Added support for specifying a default value instead of failing for remove function in array and dictionary
  - Simplified page setup guide examples
  - Switched the documentation from using the word "hashtag" to the word "hash" where appropriate
  - Added support for array.zip without any further arguments
  - Fixed crash when a plugin tried to read out of bounds memory
