ReleaseNotes: |-
  View changelog with links into the documentation on typst.app/docsHighlights
  - Added support for multi-column floating placement and figures
  - Added support for automatic line numbering (often used in academic papers)
  - Typst's layout engine is now multithreaded. Typical speedups are 2-3x for larger documents. The multithreading operates on page break boundaries, so explicit page breaks are necessary for it to kick in.
  - Paragraph justification was optimized with a new two-pass algorithm. Speedups are larger for shorter paragraphs and go up to 6x.
  - Highly reduced PDF file sizes due to better font subsetting (thanks to @LaurenzV)
  - Emoji are now exported properly in PDF
  - Added initial support for PDF/A. For now, only the PDF/A-2b profile is supported, but more is planned for the future.
  - Added various options for configuring the CLI's environment (fonts, package paths, etc.)
  - Text show rules now match across multiple text elements
  - Block-level equations can now optionally break over multiple pages
  - Fixed a bug where some fonts would not print correctly on professional printers
  - Fixed a long-standing bug which could cause headings to be orphaned at the bottom of the page
  Layout
  - Added support for multi-column floating placement and figures via place.scope and figure.scope.  Two-column documents should now prefer set page(columns: 2) over show: column.with(2) (see the page setup guide).
  - Added support for automatic line numbering (often used in academic papers)
  - Added par.spacing property for configuring paragraph spacing. This should now be used instead of show par: set block(spacing: ..) (Breaking change)
  - Block-level elements like lists, grids, and stacks now show themselves as blocks and are thus affected by all block properties (e.g. stroke) rather than just spacing (Breaking change)
  - Added block.sticky property which prevents a page break after a block
  - Added place.flush function which forces all floating figures to be placed before any further content
  - Added skew function
  - Added auto option for page.header and page.footer which results in an automatic header/footer based on the numbering (which was previously inaccessible after a change)
  - Added gap and justify parameters to repeat function
  - Added width and height parameters to the measure function to define the space in which the content should be measured. Especially useful in combination with layout.
  - The height of a block, image, rect, square, ellipse, or circle can now be specified in fractional units
  - The scale function now supports absolute lengths for x, y, factor. This way an element of unknown size can be scaled to a fixed size.
  - The values of block.above and block.below can now be retrieved in context expressions.
  - Increased accuracy of conversions between absolute units (pt, mm, cm, in)
  - Fixed a bug which could cause headings to be orphaned at the bottom of the page
  - Fixed footnotes within breakable blocks appearing on the page where the breakable block ends instead of at the page where the footnote marker is
  - Fixed numbering of nested footnotes and footnotes in floats
  - Fixed empty pages appearing when a context expression wraps whole pages
  - Fixed set block(spacing: x) behaving differently from set block(above: x, below: x)
  - Fixed behavior of rotate and scale with reflow: true
  - Fixed interaction of align(horizon) and v(1fr)
  - Fixed various bugs where floating placement would yield overlapping results
  - Fixed a bug where widow/orphan prevention would unnecessarily move text into the next column
  - Fixed weak spacing not being trimmed at the start and end of lines in a paragraph (only at the start and end of paragraphs)
  - Fixed interaction of weak page break and pagebreak.to
  - Fixed compilation output of a single weak page break
  - Fixed crash when padding by 100%
  Text
  - Tuned hyphenation: It is less eager by default and hyphenations close to the edges of words are now discouraged more strongly (May lead to larger layout reflows)
  - New default font: Libertinus Serif. This is the maintained successor to the old default font Linux Libertine. (May lead to smaller reflows)
  - Setting the font to an unavailable family will now result in a warning
  - Implemented a new smart quote algorithm, fixing various bugs where smart quotes weren't all that smart
  - Added text.costs parameter for tweaking various parameters that affect the choices of the layout engine during text layout
  - Added typm highlighting mode for math in raw blocks
  - Added basic i18n for Galician, Catalan, Latin, Icelandic, Hebrew
  - Implemented hyphenation duplication for Czech, Croatian, Lower Sorbian, Polish, Portuguese, Slovak, and Spanish.
  - The smallcaps function is now an element function and can thereby be used in show(-set) rules.
  - The raw.theme parameter can now be set to none to disable highlighting even in the presence of a language tag, and to auto to reset to the default
  - Multiple stylistic sets can now be enabled at once
  - Fixed the Chinese translation for "Equation"
  - Fixed that hyphenation could occur outside of words
  - Fixed incorrect layout of bidirectional text in edge cases
  - Fixed layout of paragraphs with explicit trailing whitespace
  - Fixed bugs related to empty paragraphs created via #""
  - Fixed accidental trailing spaces for line breaks immediately preceding an inline equation
  - Fixed text.historical-ligatures not working correctly
  - Fixed accidental repetition of Thai characters around line breaks in some circumstances
  - Fixed smart quotes for Swiss French
  - New font metadata exceptions for Archivo, Kaiti SC, and Kaiti TC
  - Updated bundled New Computer Modern fonts to version 6.0
  Math
  - Block-level equations can now break over multiple pages if enabled via show math.equation: set block(breakable: true).
  - Matrix and vector sizing is now more consistent across different cell contents
  - Added stretch function for manually or automatically stretching characters like arrows or parentheses horizontally or vertically
  - Improved layout of attachments on parenthesized as well as under- or overlined expressions
  - Improved layout of nested attachments resulting from code like #let a0 = $a_0$; $a0^1$
  - Improved layout of primes close to superscripts
  - Improved layout of fractions
  - Typst now makes use of math-specific height-dependent kerning information in some fonts for better attachment layout
  - The floor and ceil functions in math are now callable symbols, such that $ floor(x) = lr(floor.l x floor.r) $
  - The mat.delim, vec.delim, and cases.delim parameters now allow any character that is considered a delimiter or "fence" (e.g. |) by Unicode. The delim: "||" notation is not supported anymore and should be replaced by delim: bar.double (Minor breaking change)
  - Added vec.align and mat.align parameters
  - Added underparen, overparen, undershell, and overshell
  - Added ~ shorthand for tilde.op in math mode (Minor breaking change)
  - Fixed baseline alignment of equation numbers
  - Fixed positioning of corner brackets (⌜, ⌝, ⌞, ⌟)
  - Fixed baseline of large roots
  - Fixed multiple minor layout bugs with attachments
  - Fixed that alignment points could affect line height in math
  - Fixed that spaces could show up between text and invisible elements like metadata in math
  - Fixed a crash with recursive show rules in math
  - Fixed lr.size not affecting characters enclosed in mid in some cases
  - Fixed resolving of em units in sub- and superscripts
  - Fixed bounding box of inline equations when a text edge is set to "bounds"
  Introspection
  - Implemented a new system by which Typst tracks where elements end up on the pages. This may lead to subtly different behavior in introspections. (Breaking change)
  - Fixed various bugs with wrong counter behavior in complex layout situations, through a new, more principled implementation
  - Counter updates can now be before the first, in between, and after the last page when isolated by weak page breaks. This allows, for instance, updating a counter before the first page header and background.
  - Fixed logical ordering of introspections within footnotes and figures
  - Fixed incorrect here().position() when place was used in a context expression
  - Fixed resolved positions of elements (in particular, headings) whose show rule emits an invisible element (like a state update) before a page break
  - Fixed behavior of stepping a counter at a deeper level than its current state has
  - Fixed citation formatting not working in table headers and a few other places
  - Displaying the footnote counter will now respect the footnote numbering style
  Model
  - Document set rules do not need to be at the very start of the document anymore. The only restriction is that they must not occur inside of layout containers.
  - The spacing property of lists, enumerations, and term lists is now also respected for tight lists
  - Tight lists now only attach (with tighter spacing) to preceding paragraphs, not arbitrary blocks
  - The quote element is now locatable (can be used in queries)
  - The bibliography heading now uses depth instead of level so that its level can still be configured via a show-set rule
  - Added support for more numbering formats: Devanagari, Eastern Arabic, Bengali, and circled numbers
  - Added hanging-indent parameter to heading function to tweak the appearance of multi-line headings and improved default appearance of multi-line headings
  - Improved handling of bidirectional text in outline entry
  - Fixed document set rules being ignored in an otherwise empty document
  - Fixed document set rules not being usable in context expressions
  - Fixed bad interaction between set document and set page
  - Fixed show figure: set align(..). Since the default figure alignment is now a show-set rule, it is not revoked by show figure: it => it.body anymore. (Minor breaking change)
  - Fixed numbering of footnote references
  - Fixed spacing after bibliography heading
