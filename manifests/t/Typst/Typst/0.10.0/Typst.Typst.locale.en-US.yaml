ShortDescription: A new markup-based typesetting system that is powerful and easy to learn.
Description: |-
  Typst is a new markup-based typesetting system that is designed to be as powerful as LaTeX
  while being much easier to learn and use. Typst has:

  - Built-in markup for the most common formatting tasks
  - Flexible functions for everything else
  - A tightly integrated scripting system
  - Math typesetting, bibliography management, and more
  - Fast compile times thanks to incremental compilation
  - Friendly error messages in case something goes wrong
Tags:
- compiler
- markup
- typesetting
