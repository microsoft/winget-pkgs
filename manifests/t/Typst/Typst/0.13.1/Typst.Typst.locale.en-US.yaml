  - A tightly integrated scripting system
  - Math typesetting, bibliography management, and more
  - Fast compile times thanks to incremental compilation
  - Friendly error messages in case something goes wrong

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Command Line Interface
  - Fixed high CPU usage for typst watch on Linux. Depending on the project size, CPU usage would spike for varying amounts of time. This bug appeared with 0.13.0 due to a behavioral change in the inotify file watching backend.
  HTML export
  - Fixed export of tables with gutters
  - Fixed usage of <html> and <body> element within context
  - Fixed querying of metadata next to <html> and <body> element
  Visualization
  - Fixed curves with multiple non-closed components
  Introspection
  - Fixed a regression where labelled symbols could not be queried by label
  Deprecations
  - Fixed false positives in deprecation warnings for type/str comparisons
