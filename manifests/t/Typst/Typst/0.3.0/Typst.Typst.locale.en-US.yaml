ShortDescription: A new markup-based typesetting system that is powerful and easy to learn.
Description: |-
  Typst is a new markup-based typesetting system that is designed to be as powerful as LaTeX
  while being much easier to learn and use. Typst has:

  - Built-in markup for the most common formatting tasks
  - Flexible functions for everything else
  - A tightly integrated scripting system
  - Math typesetting, bibliography management, and more
  - Fast compile times thanks to incremental compilation
  - Friendly error messages in case something goes wrong

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Breaking changes:

    - Renamed a few symbols: What was previous dot.op is now just dot and the basic dot is dot.basic. The same applies to ast and tilde.
    - Renamed mod to rem to more accurately reflect the behaviour. It will remain available as mod until the next update as a grace period.
    - A lone underscore is not a valid identifier anymore, it can now only be used in patterns
    - Removed before and after arguments from query. This is now handled through flexible selectors combinator methods
    - Added support for attachments (sub-, superscripts) that precede the base symbol. The top and bottom arguments have been renamed to t and b.

  New features
    - Added support for more complex strokes (configurable caps, joins, and dash patterns)
    - Added cancel function for equations
    - Added support for destructuring in argument lists and assignments
    - Added alt text argument to image function
    - Added toml function for loading data from a TOML file
    - Added zip, sum, and product methods for arrays
    - Added fact, perm, binom, gcd, lcm, atan2, quo, trunc, and fract calculation

  Improvements
    - Text in SVGs now displays properly
    - Typst now generates a PDF heading outline
    - References now provides the referenced element as a field in show rules
    - Refined linebreak algorithm for better Chinese justification
    - Locations are now a valid kind of selector
    - Added a few symbols for algebra
    - Added Spanish smart quote support
    - Added selector function to turn a selector-like value into a selector on which combinator methods can be called
    - Improved some error messages
    - The outline and bibliography headings can now be styled with show-set rules
    - Operations on numbers now produce an error instead of overflowing

  Bug fixes
    - Fixed wrong linebreak before punctuation that follows inline equations, citations, and other elements
    - Fixed a bug with argument sinks
    - Fixed strokes with thickness zero
    - Fixed hiding and show rules in math
    - Fixed alignment in matrices
    - Fixed some alignment bugs in equations
    - Fixed grid cell alignment
    - Fixed alignment of list marker and enum markers in presence of global alignment settings
    - Fixed path closing
    - Fixed compiler crash with figure references
    - A single trailing line breaks is now ignored in math, just like in text

  Command line interface
    - Font path and compilation root can now be set with the environment variables TYPST_FONT_PATHS and TYPST_ROOT
    - The output of typst fonts now includes the embedded fonts

  Development
    - Added instrumentation for debugging and optimization
    - Added --update flag and UPDATE_EXPECT environment variable to update reference images for tests
    - You can now run a specific subset with --subtest
    - Tests now run on multiple threads
