ShortDescription: A new markup-based typesetting system that is powerful and easy to learn.
Description: |-
  Typst is a new markup-based typesetting system that is designed to be as powerful as LaTeX
  while being much easier to learn and use. Typst has:

  - Built-in markup for the most common formatting tasks
  - Flexible functions for everything else
  - A tightly integrated scripting system
  - Math typesetting, bibliography management, and more
  - Fast compile times thanks to incremental compilation
  - Friendly error messages in case something goes wrong

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Footnotes
    - Implemented support for footnotes
    - The footnote function inserts a footnote
    - The footnote.entry function can be used to customize the footnote listing
    - The "chicago-notes" citation style is now available

  Documentation
    - Added a Guide for LaTeX users
    - Now shows default values for optional arguments
    - Added richer outlines in "On this Page"
    - Added initial support for search keywords: "Table of Contents" will now find the outline function. Suggestions for more keywords are welcome!
    - Fixed issue with search result ranking
    - Fixed many more small issues

  Math
    - Breaking change: Alignment points (&) in equations now alternate between left and right alignment
    - Added support for writing roots with Unicode: For example, $root(x+y)$ can now also be written as $âˆš(x+y)$
    - Fixed uneven vertical attachment alignment
    - Fixed spacing on decorated elements (e.g., spacing around a canceled operator)
    - Fixed styling for stretchable symbols
    - Added tack.r.double, tack.l.double, dotless.i and dotless.j symbols
    - Fixed show rules on symbols (e.g. show sym.tack: set text(blue))
    - Fixed missing rename from ast.op to ast that should have been in the previous release

  Scripting
    - Added function scopes: A function can now hold related definitions in its own scope, similar to a module. The new assert.eq function, for instance, is part of the assert function's scope. Note that function scopes are currently only available for built-in functions.
    - Added assert.eq and assert.ne functions for simpler equality and inequality assertions with more helpful error messages
    - Exposed list, enum, and term list items in their respective functions' scope
    - The at methods on strings, arrays, dictionaries, and content now support specifying a default value
    - Added support for passing a function to replace that is called with each match.
    - Fixed replacement strings: They are now inserted completely verbatim instead of supporting the previous (unintended) magic dollar syntax for capture groups
    - Fixed bug with trailing placeholders in destructuring patterns
    - Fixed bug with underscore in parameter destructuring
    - Fixed crash with nested patterns and when hovering over an invalid pattern
    - Better error messages when casting to an integer or float fails

  Text and Layout
    - Implemented sophisticated CJK punctuation adjustment
    - Disabled overhang for CJK punctuation
    - Added basic translations for Traditional Chinese
    - Fixed alignment of text inside raw blocks (centering a raw block, e.g. through a figure, will now keep the text itself left-aligned)
    - Added support for passing a array instead of a function to configure table cell alignment and fill per column
    - Fixed automatic figure kind detection
    - Made alignment of enum numbers configurable, defaulting to end
    - Figures can now be made breakable with a show-set rule for blocks in figure
    - Initial fix for smart quotes in RTL languages

  Export
    - Fixed ligatures in PDF export: They are now copyable and searchable
    - Exported PDFs now embed ICC profiles for images that have them
    - Fixed export of strokes with zero thickness

  Web app
    - Projects can now contain folders
    - Added upload by drag-and-drop into the file panel
    - Files from the file panel can now be dragged into the editor to insert them into a Typst file
    - You can now copy-paste images and other files from your computer directly into the editor
    - Added a button to resend confirmation email
    - Added an option to invert preview colors in dark mode
    - Added tips to the loading screen and the Help menu. Feel free to propose more!
    - Added syntax highlighting for YAML files
    - Allowed middle mouse button click on many buttons to navigate into a new tab
    - Allowed more project names
    - Fixed overridden Vim mode keybindings
    - Fixed many bugs regarding file upload and more

  Miscellaneous Improvements
    - Improved performance of counters, state, and queries
    - Improved incremental parsing for more efficient recompilations
    - Added support for .yaml extension in addition to .yml for bibliographies
    - The CLI now emits escape codes only if the output is a TTY
    - For users of the typst crate: The Document is now Sync again and the World doesn't have to be 'static anymore
