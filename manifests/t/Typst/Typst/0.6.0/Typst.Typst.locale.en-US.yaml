ReleaseNotes: |-
  Package Management
    - Typst now has built-in package management
    - You can import published community packages or create and use system-local ones
    - Published packages are also supported in the web app

  Math
    - Added support for optical size variants of glyphs in math mode
    - Added argument to enable limits conditionally depending on whether the equation is set in display or inline style
    - Added gt.eq.slant and lt.eq.slant symbols
    - Increased precedence of factorials in math mode ($1/n!$ works correctly now)
    - Improved underlines and overlines in math mode
    - Fixed usage of limits function in show rules
    - Fixed bugs with line breaks in equations

  Text and Layout
    - Added support for alternating page margins with the inside and outside keys
    - Added support for specifying the page binding
    - Added to argument to pagebreak function to skip to the next even or odd page
    - Added basic i18n for a few more languages (TR, SQ, TL)
    - Fixed bug with missing table row at page break
    - Fixed bug with underlines
    - Fixed bug superfluous table lines
    - Fixed smart quotes after line breaks
    - Fixed a crash related to text layout

  Command line interface
    - Breaking change: Added requirement for --root/TYPST_ROOT directory to contain the input file because it designates the project root. Existing setups that use TYPST_ROOT to emulate package management should switch to local packages
    - Breaking change: Now denies file access outside of the project root
    - Added support for local packages and on-demand package download
    - Now watches all relevant files, within the root and all packages
    - Now displays compilation time

  Miscellaneous Improvements
    - Added outline.entry to customize outline entries with show rules
    - Added some hints for error messages
    - Added some missing syntaxes for raw highlighting
    - Improved rendering of rotated images in PNG export and web app
    - Made footnotes reusable and referenceable
    - Fixed bug with citations and bibliographies in locate
    - Fixed inconsistent tense in documentation

  Development
    - Added contribution guide
    - Reworked World interface to accommodate for package management and make it a bit simpler to implement (Breaking change for implementors)
