ShortDescription: A new markup-based typesetting system that is powerful and easy to learn.
Description: |-
  Typst is a new markup-based typesetting system that is designed to be as powerful as LaTeX while being much easier to learn and use. Typst has:
  - Built-in markup for the most common formatting tasks
  - Flexible functions for everything else
  - A tightly integrated scripting system
  - Math typesetting, bibliography management, and more
  - Fast compile times thanks to incremental compilation
  - Friendly error messages in case something goes wrong
Tags:
- markup
- typesetting
ReleaseNotes: |-
  PDF export
  - Fixed regression where links to labelled elements would sometimes not work correctly
  - Fixed bug where PDF text attributes could be written incorrectly
  - Fixed crash in link handling
  - Fixed crash for zero-sized pages
  - Fixed crash when a table vline or hline has an out-of-bounds index
  - Fixed crash in formatting of font-related PDF export errors
  - Fixed crash when a footnote or place element was queried and reinserted into the document
  - Fixed crash for PNGs with invalid metadata
  - Fixed bug where text in SVGs with fill-and-stroke paint order could be exported incorrectly
  - Fixed bug with layer isolation in SVGs where blending/masking is used
  - Fixed that table headers could be tagged incorrectly in some scenarios
  - Fixed issues where generated PDFs could differ between 32-bit and 64-bit systems
  - Upgraded JPEG decoder used during PDF export for improved compatibility, fixing a case where a valid JPEG was rejected
  - A PDF document information dictionary that would be empty is now fully omitted instead
  - A rare crash in PDF tagging was turned into a compiler error
  HTML export
  - Fixed export of table headers and footers with gutter
  - A page set rule in HTML export is now a warning instead of a hard error, in line with how unsupported elements are generally treated
  Math
  - Fixed regression where arrow.l.r could not be used as an accent anymore
  - Fixed that single-letter strings did not react to spaces around them like multi-letter strings do
  - Fixed that spacing around mat and vec with a fence delimiter was whitespace-dependent
  - Fixed height calculation for horizontally stretched glyphs
  Model
  - Fixed regression where Typst would error in heading numbering functions that don't handle the counter state (0,). This can occur in the first layout iteration. Such errors are usually automatically caught by Typst, which was not the case here.
  Text
  - Fixed regression where Typst would synthesize superscripts for some fonts even when typographic glyphs were available
  - Fixed regression where some oblique fonts would be classified as italic
  Scripting
  - Fixed crash due to violated invariants in array.sorted
  - Fixed crashes due to overflow in calc.rem, calc.rem-euclid, calc.div-euclid, calc.quo, and calc.gcd
  - Upgraded WebAssembly runtime, fixing a bug that plugins could run into
  Command Line Interface
  - Compiling to standard output in combination with --deps --deps-format=make (which results in an error) will not produce an empty Make dependency file as a side effect anymore
  Development
  - Increased minimum supported Rust version to 1.89
