  while being much easier to learn and use. Typst has:

  - Built-in markup for the most common formatting tasks
  - Flexible functions for everything else
  - A tightly integrated scripting system
  - Math typesetting, bibliography management, and more
  - Fast compile times thanks to incremental compilation
  - Friendly error messages in case something goes wrong

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Breaking changes:
    - Removed support for iterating over index and value in for loops. This is now handled via unpacking and enumerating. Same goes for the map() method.
    - Dictionaries now iterate in insertion order instead of alphabetical order.

  New features
    - Added unpacking syntax for let bindings, which allows things like let (1, 2) = array
    - Added enumerate() method
    - Added path function for drawing BÃ©zier paths
    - Added layout function to access the size of the surrounding page or container
    - Added key parameter to sorted() method

  Command line interface
    - Fixed --open flag blocking the program
    - New Computer Modern font is now embedded into the binary
    - Shell completions and man pages can now be generated by setting the GEN_ARTIFACTS environment variable to a target directory and then building Typst

  Miscellaneous improvements
    - Fixed page numbering in outline
    - Added basic i18n for a few more languages (AR, NB, CS, NN, PL, SL, ES, UA, VI)
    - Added a few numbering patterns (Ihora, Chinese)
    - Added sinc operator
    - Fixed bug where math could not be hidden with hide
    - Fixed sizing issues with box, block, and shapes
    - Fixed some translations
    - Fixed inversion of "R" in cal and frak styles
    - Fixed some styling issues in math
    - Fixed supplements of references to headings
    - Fixed syntax highlighting of identifiers in certain scenarios
    - Ratios can now be multiplied with more types and be converted to floats with the float function
