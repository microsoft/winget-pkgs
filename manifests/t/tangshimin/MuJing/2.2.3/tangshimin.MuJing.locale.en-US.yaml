ShortDescription: Generate thesauruses (word book) from MKV videos so that each word has a specific context, and then memorize the words, sentences, and subtitles through the context.
Description: Learn English by immersion. Use any movies, series or documents you like to generate your thesaurus. When memorising words, you can better understand and remember words by practising spelling and watching relevant video clips. When playing movies, you can review the words in the thesaurus through Dammu, making word memorisation less of a chore.
