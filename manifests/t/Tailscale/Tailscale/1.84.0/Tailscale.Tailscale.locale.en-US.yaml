ReleaseNotes: |-
  All platforms
  - New: The --reason flag is added to the tailscale down command.
  - New: ReconnectAfter policy setting, which configures the maximum period of time between a user disconnecting Tailscale and the client automatically reconnecting.
  - Changed: Tailscale CLI commands throw an error if multiple of the same flag are detected.
  - Fixed: Network connectivity issues when creating a new profile or switching profiles while using an exit node.
  Linux
  - Fixed: DNS-over-TCP fallback works correctly with upstream servers reachable only via the tailnet.
  Windows
  - New: AlwaysOn.Enabled and AlwaysOn.OverrideWithReason policy settings, which enable and configure a Tailscale client mode where the client stays connected at all times, unless an exception applies.
  - New: When Always On mode is enabled, Tailscale connects as soon as a user signs in to the device and stays connected, regardless of whether the GUI is running. This enables access to tailnet resources, such as network-mapped drives, earlier in the sign-in process, and can also be used on headless Windows environments.
  - New: EnableDNSRegistration policy setting, which configures whether Tailscale IP addresses should be registered with Active Directory DNS.
  - New: The Tailscale GUI starts for all signed-in users when the client is installed.
  - Fixed: DNS-over-TCP fallback works correctly with upstream servers reachable only via the tailnet.
  - Fixed: Issue where the Tailscale GUI would not start if the client was installed via Group Policy or mobile device management (MDM) while a user was already signed in.
  - Fixed: Issue where the Tailscale GUI did not auto-start after a client update.
  macOS
  - New: AlwaysOn.Enabled and AlwaysOn.OverrideWithReason policy settings, which enable and configure a Tailscale client mode where the client stays connected at all times, unless an exception applies.
  - Changed: ForceEnabled policy setting is deprecated in favor of the AlwaysOn policy setting.
  - Fixed: DNS-over-TCP fallback works correctly with upstream servers reachable only via the tailnet.
  - Fixed: Tailscale automatically recreates and/or reactivates its VPN configuration on start.
  - Fixed: Occasional crash in client during engine updates.
  - Fixed: Taildrop share sheet displays the correct error page when the tunnel is not connected.
