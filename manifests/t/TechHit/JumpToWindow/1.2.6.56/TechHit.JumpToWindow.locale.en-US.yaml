ShortDescription: Quickly switch between open application windows
Description: JumpToWindow is designed to help you quickly switch between open windows and application. Instead of using Alt+Tab or the mouse, JumpToWindow allows you to switch to a window by typing just a few characters of its title or application name. It might not sound that impressive at first, but you will literally use it hundreds of time every single day.
