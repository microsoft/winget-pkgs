ReleaseNotes: |-
  New in 3.23.0
  Check out our release blog to get a brief overview of the most important updates in this release.
  - The Table Import Wizard now supports Fabric SQL Databases and Fabric Mirrored Databases as data sources, both for Import and Direct Lake mode models, in line with the announcement in the Power BI Desktop July 2025 update.
  - Native ARM64 support.
  - Preparations for upcoming Power BI features (which we can't disclose just yet).
  Improvements in 3.23.0
  - Main window now remembers its position & size. Can be disabled in Preferences > Tabular Editor > User Interface > Layout.
  - Messages view now copies the selected cell rather than the whole row by default, Ctrl+Shift+C can be used to copy the whole row as before. There is a new right click context menu with these (Copy Cell, Copy Row) options as well.
  - Updated 3rd party dependencies including AMO/TOM to v. 19.103.2.
  - A new word wrap option is now exposed in toolbar, menu (Edit > Word Wrap) and preferences window (Text Editors > General). Line wrap indicators can also be enabled in the preferences.
  - The C# script editor's auto complete now provides more flexible search (i.e. search for partial matches and search by capital letters).
  - You can now use the "Apply" or "Apply selection" action on DAX queries containing DEFINE COLUMN or DEFINE TABLE statements, in addition to DEFINE MEASURE statements. This will create the corresponding calculated columns or calculated tables in the model, or update their DAX expressions if they already exist.
  - Peek definition window now lets user scroll the main DAX editor instead of swallowing mouse scroll inputs while the mouse is on it.
  - Peek definition window height is now adjusted more tightly.
  - Semantic Analyzer no longer shows "Multiple column cannot be converted to a scalar value" errors, when there are other, more indicative error messages.
  Bugfixes in 3.23.0
  - Fixed a bug where you would have to enable Allow unsupported modelling operations in order to make any changes to a model in Power BI Desktop, even though modelling operations were supported.
  - Fixed a bug where main window exceeds screen dimensions depending on resolution and DPI scaling.
  - Fixed toolbar customization settings such as "Large icons", "Show ScreenTips on toolbars" etc. not persisting after restarting TE3.
  - Fixed a visual glitch where TOM Explorer's Perspective and Language drop-down controls have duplicate buttons.
  - Fixed a bunch of issues with "Peek definiton" feature:
    - Peek definition is closed on undo/redo operations
    - Peek definition is invisible when used on the last line of DAX editor
    - Peek definition turns invisible when the line ending of the peeked reference is deleted
    - Peek definition is also closed when trying to instead close auto-complete popup with ESC
    - Peek definition is also closed when trying to instead clear rectangular-selection with ESC
    - When a new line is added to the left of peeked reference, peek definition turns invisible and empty padding space incorrectly appears above the peeked reference
    - Fix empty padding space appearing under the wrong line if the caret is on a different line than the peeked reference when the peek definition is triggered
  - Calltips in the C# code editor are now sized correctly, ensuring that all of the calltip text is visible.
  - Fixed a bug where Fabric Warehouses were not correctly listed in the Fabric connection dialog (instead they were shown as type "Unknown").
  - DAX autocomplete should no longer suggest DAY for the <Interval> parameter of the PARALLELPERIOD function, as this is not a valid value for that parameter.
  - Calltips will now update correctly when swapping between different syntax alternatives using the up/down arrows.
  - Fixed a bug where code actions did not update correctly when switching between objects.
  - Fix line numbers in code editors getting cut off when zoomed in.
