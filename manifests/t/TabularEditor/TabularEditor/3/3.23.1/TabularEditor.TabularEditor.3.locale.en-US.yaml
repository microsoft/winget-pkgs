ReleaseNotes: |-
  New in 3.23.0
  Check out our release blog to get a brief overview of the most important updates in this release.
  - Tabular Editor 3 now supports DAX User-Defined Functions (UDFs). This is a big, important feature, and we can't do it justice in a few bullet points. Please check out the dedicated documentation section to learn more.
  - As if one big feature wasn't enough, we also added support for Calendars in this release, including DAX parser and editor support for 8 new DAX functions related to week-based time intelligence. Again, please see the dedicated documentation section to learn more.
  Improvements in 3.23.1
  - We added Compatibility Level 1700 (SQL Server 2025) to the dropdown in the New Model dialog. Moreover, the default Compatibility Level for Power BI models has been updated to 1702 (which is needed for UDFs and Calendars).
  Bugfixes in 3.23.1
  - This update fixes several bugs related to UDFs and Calendars compared to 3.23.0. Mostly related to our built-in DAX parser, but also several tweaks and stability improvements for things like autocomplete, formatting, etc.
  - We have downgraded the version of MSAL (Microsoft.Identity.Client) library to 4.72.1, as the newer versions of this library (used in the previous release of Tabular Editor 3), do not work well with the AS client library, causing the application to hang when using the Microsoft Entra ID authentication option.
  - Removed the Duplicate and Cut/Copy/Paste/Delete actions for Calculated Table Columns, as these objects cannot be manually added/removed from tables, and doing so would cause issues upon saving the changes to Analysis Services / Power BI. You should modify the DAX of the calculated table instead.
  - Mirrored Azure Databricks catalogs are now also shown in the Table Import Wizard UI, when choosing the Fabric Mirrored Database option.
  - Fixed an issue where opening a model created with older versions of Power BI Desktop would cause a "The given key 'Extended Properties' was not present in the dictionary" error.
  - Fixed a bug that prevented forward references in DAX script object properties. I.e. you no longer get an error if the FormatString property of a measure references a measure defined later in the script.
