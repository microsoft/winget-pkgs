ShortDescription: High performance, multi-platform VNC client and server
Description: TigerVNC is a high-performance, platform-neutral implementation of VNC (Virtual Network Computing), a client/server application that allows users to launch and interact with graphical applications on remote machines. TigerVNC provides the levels of performance necessary to run 3D and video applications, and it attempts to maintain a common look and feel and re-use components, where possible, across the various platforms that it supports. TigerVNC also provides extensions for advanced authentication methods and TLS encryption.

  TigerVNC 1.12.0 is now available. Lots of changes have been made since the last release, but the highlights are:

  - Recent server history in the native viewer
  - The native viewer now has an option to reconnect if the connection is dropped
  - Translations are now enabled on Windows and macOS for the native viewer
  - The native viewer now respects the system security policy¹
  - Better handling of accented keys in the Java viewer
  - The Unix servers can now listen to both a Unix socket and a TCP port at the same time
  - The network code in both the servers and the native viewer has been restructured to give a more responsive experience
  - The vncserver service now correctly handles settings set to "0"
  - Fixed the clipboard Unicode handling in both the native viewer and the servers
  - Support for pointer "warping" in Xvnc and the native viewer, enabling e.g. FPS games
