ReleaseNotes: |-
  On Friday, August 29th, 2025, a new Desktop App 2.4.0 version will be available on the download page.
  Enhancement:
  - Update to MSI Installer: The MSI installer was updated to run as a 64-bit application instead of 32-bit, to improve performance. As stated in the documentation, when updating the MSI installer package, the previous version must be uninstalled before deploying the newer version.
  Fix:
  - We corrected a bug from version 2.2.1 that forced dashboard links to open in the browser. Now, they'll correctly open in the desktop app, ensuring your downloads work as expected.
  Please see this product notice for more information about Talkdesk’s Desktop App release cadence.
