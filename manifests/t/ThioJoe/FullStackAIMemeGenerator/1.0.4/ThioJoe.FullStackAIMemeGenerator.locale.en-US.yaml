ReleaseNotes: |-
  ðŸŸ¢ 1.0.2 â†’ 1.0.4 -- Fixes and Improvements:
  - Default model is now gpt-3.5-turbo because everyone has access to it, unlike GPT-4 which has additional requirements
  - After completion, now asks for user confirmation before closing the window, and displays output path
  - Now explains "The model gpt-4 does not exist" error returned by OpenAI if the user does not have access to GPT-4
  - Add general error handling.
    Also will allow users to actually see the error message because it won't immediately close the window.
  - The noUserInput command line argument should now be respected even during error messages.
    Only exception is the first-time run when it creates the api and settings files.
  - Removed unnecessary 'you have the latest version' message
  - Fixed crash when certain Unicode characters were in the config file
  1.0.1 â†’ 1.0.2:
  - Fixed incorrect passing of variables and API key validation because of leftover global variables, which caused issues when using Stability AI as image platform (#5)
  - Added clarification about OpenAI option using DALLE2 in settings file
