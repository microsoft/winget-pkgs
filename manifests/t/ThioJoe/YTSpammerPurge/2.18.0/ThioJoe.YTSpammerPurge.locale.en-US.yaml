ReleaseNotes: |-
  üò§ [2.18] MAJOR New Feature: Much faster filter loading before scans
  - Now instead of compiling all the regex filters before every scan, the program will save cached files of the longest lists
  - This eliminates nearly all of the loading time before every scan
  - The compiling will only need to be done once whenever new filter files are downloaded
  üéâ [2.18] New Features:
  - Encrypted Token File
    - Adds new encrypt_token_file option in config, which is False by default. If True, next time the program is run, or whenever the user logs in, the token file will be replaced by an encrypted version. The user will enter the password for this.
    - If False, it will not have the user enter a password to encrypt the file. But if an encrypted token file already exists, it will still prompt the user for the password.
  - Dynamic Sample Text Length From Window Size
    - The printing of the comment samples list after a scan will now automatically adapt to the window size, so you can expand the window to see more of each comment sample
  - Highlighted Spam List Matches in Samples
    - Text in the samples list that matches a known spam list will be highlighted so they are easier to identify
  ‚ö†Ô∏è [2.18] Other Notable Changes
  - Disabled 'possible false positive' check because it was not reliable at all
  - Changed moderator mode check to allow moderators fully automated holding of comments (#935)
  üõ†Ô∏èFixes Since 2.18.0-Beta3:
  - Fixed updated downloaded filter variables list not being used when running .exe version
  - Fixed community post scanning
