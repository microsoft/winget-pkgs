  üò§ [2.17] MAJOR New Feature: Remote filter Update Without Needing Update
  - The program will now automatically go and check the GitHub repo to see if there is a new version of filter_variables.py
  - A full program update is no longer required to update the filters, which will make it much easier to make small and/or faster filter improvements
  üéâ [2.17] New Features:
  - Multi-Variable Spam Checking

      - The program now has new filtering functions that can check more complex spam patterns
  - New Fuzzy Duplicate Detection

      - The program now uses the "RapidFuzz" module which can be many times faster than the previous method, meaning duplicate comments will be scanned MUCH faster
  - Channel ID Lookup Tool

      - There is a new main menu option for "helpful tools". The only one right now allows you to retrieve the Channel ID for a channel by providing a YouTube video URL for that channel.
  üìà [2.17] Other Improvements
  - Improved update checking method should allow you to still be notified of the latest beta version, even if there was a stable release of the previous version after it

  - Add support for YouTube @ handles

  - Added automatic retry of downloads (program or list updates) on fail, using alternative download method

  ‚ö†Ô∏è [2.17] Other Notable Changes
