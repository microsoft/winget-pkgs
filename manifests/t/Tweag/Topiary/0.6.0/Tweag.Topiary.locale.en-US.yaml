ShortDescription: Topiary aims to be a uniform formatter for simple languages, as part of the Tree-sitter ecosystem. It is named after the art of clipping or trimming trees into fantastic shapes.
Description: Topiary is designed for formatter authors and formatter users. Authors can create a formatter for a language without having to write their own formatting engine or even their own parser. Users benefit from uniform code style and, potentially, the convenience of using a single formatter tool, across multiple languages over their codebases, each with comparable styles applied.
