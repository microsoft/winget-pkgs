ReleaseNotes: |-
  Important! If you are using tools for the first time, please read Beginner's guide and AlienFX-GUI readme to configure out its concept and operation principle.
  Fan-SDK_V1.zip have binaries built against older fan control version, use it only in case you know what you're doing (or have Aurora R7), check readme file inside archive first to configure out how to make it working!
  Changes into this release:
  AlienFX-GUI:
  - New: Now you can select both file and folder as a profile switch trigger. In case folder selected, any app running from this folder and below will trigger profile switch. Quite useful for folders like "C:\Games" etc. ^_^
  - New: Non-blockable light updates. In case you have many devices (f.e. notebook keyboard and notebook chassis), and some of them require more time to update lights (f.e. power button operation in process) - it will not block other device updates (especially useful for fast-pace effects like Haptic and Grid). It also eliminates "light overflow" logic and will only skip light updates for slow devices.
  - Profile switch logic reworked, especially for situation "Do not switch for desktop" option enabled. Now it handles task switch to desktop correctly. Also, Windows 11 search window added into desktop exception list.
  - No more "Save settings" file selection at Devices and Grids tab. Settings always stored into app folder with the name "Current.csv", and explorer window opened after operation complete.
  - Bug fixed: last update at stop/exit doesn't finish correctly (light updates stopped before query empty). This can provide incorrect color state after application quit or during system restart.
  Known issues:
  - For now, you can select folder, not file for script name or at "Load settings" operation. It will provide no effect, but i working for block this situation.
