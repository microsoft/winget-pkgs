ReleaseNotes: |-
  Important! If you are using tools for the first time, please read Beginner's guide and AlienFX-GUI readme to configure out its concept and operation principle.
  Fan-SDK_V1.zip have binaries built against older fan control version, use it only in case you know what you're doing (or have Aurora R7), check readme file inside archive first to configure out how to make it working!
  Changes into this release:
  Fan control SDK:
  - Hardware detection improved for some desktop systems (f.e. Aurora R12) - it has uncommon ID scheme, so some power modes were detected as sensors before.
  AlienFX-GUI:
  - New: Accent color now come into full play:
    - Any zone color/effect phase (at the "Colors" tab) can be assigned as "Accent color" (see checkbox at UI).
    - In case color/effect selected as accent color, its color defined as a Windows "Accent color" setting.
    - It will follow Windows accent color if it changed into Windows Settings automatically (in case app running).
    - Unchecking "Accent color" into the app roll it back to previously selected color.
    - For now, this only possible for color selectoin and Events effect (via "Use default color"). Haptics and Grid doesn't have this setting yet (i not sure it useful for this kind of effects), and this not applicable for Ambient effect.
    - Old method (you have system accent color as a last custom color at any color selection dialogue) still working.
  - Profile switch performance improved significantly (especially for big, complex profiles with a lot of zone sets and effects).
  - I continue to minimise flickering at profile change and refresh. For now, multiply-effect profile switching optimised - it set less lights and only one time.
  Known issues:
  - Power mode switch at R12 systems still operating incorrectly (except Manual mode). Work in progress.
