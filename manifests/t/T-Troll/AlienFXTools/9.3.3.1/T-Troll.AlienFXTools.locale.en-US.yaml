ReleaseNotes: |-
  Important! If you are using tools for the first time, please read Beginner's guide and AlienFX-GUI readme to configure out its concept and operation principle.
  Fan-SDK_V1.zip have binaries built against older fan control version, use it only in case you know what you're doing (or have Aurora R7), check readme file inside archive first to configure out how to make it working!
  Changes into this release:
  Light control SDK:
  - Bug fixed: If device doesn't have "save" mode (APIv5+), light refresh skipped instead of do common refresh.
  All GUI tools:
  - Power mode switch notification will be shown for shortcut and tray menu power mode switch. But selection from UI will not provide it.
  AlienFX-GUI:
  - New: Profile list sorted by alphabet at main window and at the "Profiles" tab. Tray menu profile list not sorted yet.
  - New: Aurora R16 added to autodetect list.
  - Grid effect processing rework for smooth transaction.
  - Screen refresh rate processing improved, now it reflects to external refresh rate change (f.e. from Settings), as well as some other improvements.
  - Profile switch logic changed - now profile will be switched to Default correctly after active app quit if "Do not switch for desktop" active.
  - Profile switch logic optimised, now it does not skip light color changes (forced update).
  - Bug fixed: App crash after app switching current profile quit.
  - Bug fixed: Lights do not update completely at app quit.
  - Bug fixed: Grid state do not update correctly at zone selection/creation/deletion in some cases.
  - Bug fixed: Profile can be switched at app start even if "Auto switch" not active.
  - Bug fixed: Double profile switch at app minimise.
  Known issues:
  - Grid updates for zone with "Reverse" gauge still can have some visual glitches.
  - Screen refresh rate will not be restored to app start state after app quit, but will be kept to last state. It may be correct behaviour, so i need you feedback about this.
