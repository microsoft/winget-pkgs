ReleaseNotes: |-
  Important! If you are using tools for the first time, please read Beginner's guide and AlienFX-GUI readme to configure out its concept and operation principle.
  Fan-SDK_V1.zip have binaries built against older fan control version, use it only in case you know what you're doing (or have Aurora R7), check readme file inside archive first to configure out how to make it working!
  Changes into this release:
  There is no new functionality or special bug fixes, just massive code refactoring for all components. As a result:
  - All tools smaller up to 3% and consume less RAM.
  - Multi-threading routines rework provide much better performance for shared data access (up to 5x!), so lights, effects and fan control processing consumes significantly less CPU.
  Additionally, for AlienFX-GUI:
  - Ambient light effect now better adapt to the screen size and should keep the same CPU load for any display resolution (especially for 4k+).
  - Massive light updates (lot of light changes per phase) performance improved
  - At light device overload situation (so it can't process light changes in time, but keep in query), effects now processed off-light to keep timing and prevent "pause" effect.
  - For Events effect, network monitoring reworked, now it has progressive scale to better process low-traffic situation (but still don't bother light for background tasks). Some rare bugs also fixed.
