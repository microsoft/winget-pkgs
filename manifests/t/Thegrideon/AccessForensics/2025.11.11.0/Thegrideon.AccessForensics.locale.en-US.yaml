ShortDescription: Access Forensics is an advanced tool for MS Access database analysis, data preview and recovery as well as password recovery and protection removal.
Description: |-
  Access Forensics by Thegrideon Software is an advanced tool for MS Access database analysis, data preview and recovery as well as password recovery and protection removal.
  It recovers deleted tables, records (rows) and columns; shows database structure, tables, properties and VBA source code; recovers database passwords and user-level security records; can be used to edit database properties and access rights, remove VBA protection and more...
  Access Forensics works with all MS Access files (.mdb, .accdb, ...) from version 2000 to 2024.

  * Access Forensics is designed with 3 main goals: gain access to protected database, analyse database content and recover deleted or hidden information still present in the file. It works with database files directly - independent from any Access libraries or components, so you can edit parameters regardless of access rights and extract data unavailable in any other way.
  * MS Access 2000-2003: Password to open and user-level security records can be recovered instantly to access database, recreate lost workgroup information file (.mdw) or recover logins from existing .mdw. Internal permission editor can be used to fix access rights right away if the goal is to access data as fast as possible.
  * MS Access 2007-2024: User-level security was deprecated and exhaustive password search is required for "password to open" recovery due to stronger cryptographic algorithms used. Access Forensics password recovery engine is based on our well known ACCDB Password tool. Highly optimized assembler code and GPU utilization as well as precise search range setup with advanced mixed attacks are at your service.
  * Database Properties: One of the functions of database properties (settings) is to control user interface and access to menu and tools. This is used to limit user access to database structure and data. Access Forensics allows you to edit database properties. Just a few examples: enable AllowBypassKey, StartUpShowDBWindow, edit CustomRibbonID to disable custom ribbon menu with limited functionality, switch of MDE flag to access locked mde/accde database and export forms, edit StartUpForm property to disable of change initial form, etc...
  * VBA: Access Forensics can reset VBA Project protection. Internal VBA code viewer is available with highlighted source code to check the safety of modules and classes included as well as check security measures applied in VBA code.
  * Data Recovery: Access Forensics is mainly designed to analyze data in a valid (uncorrupted) database. Although it is not its main goal, it can also be used to analyse damaged databases. Redundant information available in a database is used to recover deleted tables, records (table rows) and columns. Columns recovery is a unique feature of our tool and a quite important one. It is not uncommon practice to "delete" several columns with personal data and send database (with data still accessible) to business partners or clients.
