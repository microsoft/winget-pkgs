ShortDescription: Go compiler for small places. Microcontrollers, WebAssembly (WASM/WASI), and command-line tools. Based on LLVM.
Description: |-
  TinyGo is a Go compiler intended for use in small places such as microcontrollers, WebAssembly (wasm/wasi), and command-line tools.

  It reuses libraries used by the Go language tools alongside LLVM to provide an alternative way to compile programs written in the Go programming language.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  This is probably our fastest time in-between full releases, especially given all of the excellent work that has made it in. A few highlights are updated compatibility with the latest WASI work from the Bytecode Alliance, faster speed and PIO support for the RP2350, and a new garbage collector option for Linux. Plus a bunch of critical fixes to make your life better!
  - general
    - add the Boehm-Demers-Weiser GC on Linux
  - ci
    - add more tests for wasm and baremetal
  - compiler
    - crypto/internal/sysrand is allowed to use unsafe signatures
  - examples
    - add goroutine benchmark to examples
  - fixes
    - ensure use of pointers for SPI interface on atsam21/atsam51 and other machines/boards that were missing implementation (#4798)
    - replace loop counter with hw timer for USB SetAddressReq on rp2040 (#4796)
  - internal
    - update to go.bytecodealliance.org@v0.6.2 in GNUmakefile and internal/wasm-tools
    - exclude certain files when copying package in internal/cm
    - update to go.bytecodealliance.org/cm@v0.2.2 in internal/cm
    - remove old reflect.go in internal/reflectlite
  - loader
    - use build tags for package iter and iter methods on reflect.Value in loader, iter, reflect
    - add shim for go1.22 and earlier in loader, iter
  - machine
    - bump rp2040 to 200MHz (#4768)
    - correct register address for Pin.SetInterrupt for rp2350 (#4782)
    - don't block the rp2xxx UART interrupt handler
    - fix RP2040 Pico board on the playground
    - add flash support for rp2350 (#4803)
  - os
    - add stub Symlink for wasm
  - refactor
    - use *SPI everywhere to make consistent for implementations. Fixes #4663 "in reverse" by making SPI a pointer everywhere, as discussed in the comments.
  - reflect
    - add Value.SetIter{Key,Value} and MapIter.Reset in reflect, internal/reflectlite
    - embed reflectlite types into reflect types in reflect, internal/reflectlite
    - add Go 1.24 iter.Seq[2] methods
    - copy reflect iter tests from upstream Go
    - panic on Type.CanSeq[2] instead of returning false
    - remove strconv.go
    - remove unused go:linkname functions
  - riscv-qemu
    - add VirtIO RNG device
    - increase stack size
  - runtime
    - only allocate heap memory when needed
    - remove unused file func.go
    - use package reflectlite
  - transform
    - cherry-pick from #4774
