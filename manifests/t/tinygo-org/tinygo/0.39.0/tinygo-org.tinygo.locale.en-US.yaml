ShortDescription: Go compiler for small places. Microcontrollers, WebAssembly (WASM/WASI), and command-line tools. Based on LLVM.
Description: |-
  TinyGo is a Go compiler intended for use in small places such as microcontrollers, WebAssembly (wasm/wasi), and command-line tools.

  It reuses libraries used by the Go language tools alongside LLVM to provide an alternative way to compile programs written in the Go programming language.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  This release has what you need the most right now, which is Go 1.25 support! Of course it has other new features, such as adding multicore support for the RP2350 family of processors as well as for macOS. We've also got fixes, and as always further improvements for reflect support and stdlib packages. Plus a couple of new boards too!
  - general
    - all: add Go 1.25 support
    - net: update to latest tinygo net package
    - docs: clarify build verification step for macOS users
    - Add flag to skip Renesas SVD builds
  - build
    - Makefile: install missing dlmalloc files
    - flash: add -o flag support to save built binary (Fixes #4937) (#4942)
    - fix: update version of clang to 17 to accommodate latest Go 1.25 docker base image
  - ci
    - chore: update all CI builds to test Go 1.25 release
    - fix: disable test-newest since CircleCI seems unable to download due to rate-limits on Dockerhub
    - ci: rename some jobs to avoid churn on every Go/LLVM version bump
    - ci: make the goroutines test less racy
    - tests: de-flake goroutines test
  - compiler

    - machine: make I2C usable in the simulator
    - fix: add SPI and I2C to teensy 4.1 (#4943)
