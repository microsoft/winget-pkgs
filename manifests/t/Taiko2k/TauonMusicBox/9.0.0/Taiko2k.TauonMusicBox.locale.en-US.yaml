  Announcing Tauon music box v9.0.0!

  This feature is Linux only for now. It should work out the box for Flatpak users. For Arch Linux package users you'll need to install projectm-git from the AUR for this feature to work.
  Check the Tauon docs for more details on how to use this feature.
  Other changes
  - Added support for taskbar progress on Linux. (e.g applies to KDE Plasma)
  - Added A/B repeat feature. (Right click the repeat button to access)
  - [macOS] Desktop now playing and media keys are now supported.
  - [macOS] The DMG install process has been improved. (Still not signed though)
  - Many small miscellaneous fixes.
  Other news 📰
  New website!
  We have a new website design. Documentation that was on the Github Wiki has now been migrated to the site for a more unified documentation experience. This should make it easier for contributors to edit the docs as well.
  Spotify deprecation intent
  Spotify are further restricting their API. As I'm no longer interested in maintaining this feature and public sentiment around Spotify seems to be trending downward. I'm one again going to look at removing Spotify support in a future release.
