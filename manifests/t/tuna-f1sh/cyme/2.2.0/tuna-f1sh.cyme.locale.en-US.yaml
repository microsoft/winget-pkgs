ReleaseNotes: |-
  cyme watch subcommand to watch for USB device hotplug events and live edit display settings. A simple TUI proof of concept that grew beyond just showing hotplug events into something quite handy for exploring enumerated devices. It can also edit display settings and save them to the cyme config file.
  It's a nice way to customise display blocks: press 'b' to use the editor and 'Ctrl-s' to save. Use '?' for other keybindings. Navigation is mostly Vim-like. Try connecting and disconnecting a device while running cyme watch to see the hotplug events.
  The interface is simplistic at the moment but could be re-skinned with something like Ratatui in the future.
  Here's a quick demo: https://youtu.be/ohRBrVBRolA
  Added
  - cyme watch subcommand to watch for USB device hotplug events and 'live' edit display settings (#58).
  - no_color option to config. Clearer parity/merge with CLI args.
  - device event and DeviceBlock::LastEvent, DeviceBlock::EventIcon. Default is profiled time (P: %y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S) but used by cyme watch to show connect/disconnect events.
  - benches for profiling.
  - RUST_LOG can be module level eg: RUST_LOG=nusb=info,cyme=debug.
  Changed
  - build: Makefile targets used in CI (#64).
  - custom PortPath type used for get_ methods improves look-up 70-100%. Makes profiler faster as it uses these methods to build the device tree. (801aa).
  - simple_logger now logs to stderr so can be redirected without effecting display output: cyme watch 2> log.
  - path args String to PathBuf.
