ReleaseNotes: |-
  Changelog:
  - Added native arm64 support on macOS.
  - Added a variant of love.filesystem.newFileData which accepts a Data object.
  - Added Body:getLocalPoints.
  - Added Font:getKerning.
  - Added support for r16, rg16, and rgba16 pixel formats in Canvases.
  - Added Shader:send(name, matrixlayout, data, ...) variant, whose argument order is more consistent than Shader:send(name, data, matrixlayout, ...).
  - Changed all builds and platforms where LOVE provides LuaJIT to use LuaJIT 2.1 instead of 2.0.
  - Changed love.timer.getTime to start at 0 when the module is first loaded.
  - Changed certain out-of-Lua-memory situations to show a message box instead of instantly crashing.
  - Changed the naming scheme of LOVE's embedded Lua files for improved integration with Lua chunkname APIs.
  - Fixed build-time compatibility with Lua 5.4.
  - Fixed code compatibility with math.mod and string.gfind when LuaJIT 2.1 is used.
  - Fixed errors on some systems related to > 53 bit pointer addresses, when recent versions of LuaJIT 2.1 are used.
  - Fixed the default error handler showing a blank screen on some mobile devices.
  - Fixed drag-and-drop to open a love game on macOS causing love.event.quit("restart") to fail.
  - Fixed fused macOS apps opening other love games when drag-and-drop is used (if the fused app hasn't already removed .love files from recognized document types).
  - Fixed File:isEOF when called on a dropped file.
  - Fixed support for > 2GB dropped files on desktops.
  - Fixed ByteData and DataView missing Data:clone implementations.
  - Fixed love.physics meter scale value persisting after love.event.quit("restart").
  - Fixed audio to resume properly after interruption on iOS.
  - Fixed love.graphics.newVideo to error instead of crash when an invalid video file is given.
  - Fixed initial window creation to set the window's title during creation instead of after.
  - Fixed the window's screen position when exiting fullscreen via love.window.setFullscreen.
  - Fixed love.displayrotated being given a boolean instead of an enum string.
  - Fixed memory corruption and a crash when drawing smooth lines.
  - Fixed a crash in Canvas:newImageData when the pixel format's pixel byte size multiplied by its width isn't a multiple of 4.
  - Fixed love.graphics.newVolumeImage when explicit mipmaps are provided.
  - Fixed freezes and crashes in automatic batching when an AMD GPU is used.
  - Fixed love.graphics.print and Image:replacePixels on more AMD/ATI GPUs.
  - Fixed Font:setFallbacks to account for different DPI scales in each fallback font.
  - Fixed Font:getWrap to not remove trailing newlines.
  - Fixed Text:getWidth when the Text's string only contains spaces.
  - Fixed a crash with some Intel graphics drivers on Linux.
  - Fixed a hang with some Intel graphics drivers on Windows, by preventing gamma correct rendering on affected systems.
  - Fixed a crash with some Intel graphics drivers on Windows when mipmapped Canvases are used.
  - Fixed texture memory reported by love.graphics.getStats when a volume or array Canvas is created.
  - Fixed DXT1 textures which use 1 bit alpha-cutout.
  - Fixed rare issues where textures were not sent to shaders correctly.
  - Fixed Shader:send(name, data, matrixlayout, ...).
  - Fixed quad offsets in ParticleSystems when ParticleSystem:setOffset is not used.
  - Fixed a performance issue with setting a small subrange of data in non-stream Meshes and SpriteBatches.
  - Fixed rounded rectangles breaking if the rx or ry parameters are negative.
  - Fixed rounded rectangle automatic points calculation when rx or ry are more than half the rectangle's size.
  - Fixed source code compilation on Xcode 12+.
  - Fixed source code compilation on Linux systems that don't provide posix_spawn APIs.
