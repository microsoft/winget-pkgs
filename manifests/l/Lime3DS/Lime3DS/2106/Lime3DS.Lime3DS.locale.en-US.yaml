  - Disabled telemetry features left over from Citra and removed related settings
  - Removed settings related to Citra Web Service, as the servers no longer exist

  - Fixed missing branding on MacOS
  - Updated Android package ID, hopefully for the last time
  - Builds produced from release unified source archives now display the corresponding version number in-app
