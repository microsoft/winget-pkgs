ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Fixed a major crashing issue on ARM MacOS introduced in 2106
  - Android: Added button haptics
  - Updated dependencies

  Notes
  - If the haptics aren't working for you, please ensure that you have haptics enabled and/ or your phone supports the appropraite haptics by using a haptics checker app
  - A non-insignificant amount of time was dedicated purely to investigating the aforementioned MacOS crash. For this reason, today's update is quite small
