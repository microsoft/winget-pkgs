ShortDescription: A Nintendo 3DS emulator based on Citra.
ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Linux: Downgraded minimum glibc version from 2.38 to 2.36
      - This fixes a regression introduced in 2110 where certain Linux distros, such as the Steam Deck's SteamOS, were unable to launch Lime3DS via AppImage due to the glibc version being too recent
  - Android: Updated internal resolution selection interface to more closely match the desktop equivalent
      - The setting is now configured using a dropdown menu instead of a slider
      - Alongside the multiplier, the resulting resolution is now also displayed
  - Updated log filenames
      - citra_log.txt --> lime3ds_log.txt
      - citra_log.txt.old.txt --> lime3ds_log.old.txt
  Notes:
  - It is recommended to delete the old citra_log.XXX files to avoid accidentally sending them instead of the newer files when filing bug reports
  - We are currently looking for maintainers to help with reviewing PRs and investigating issues
      - Must have prior experience contributing to open source projects and familiarity with C++
      - Bonus points if you contributed to Citra
      - Inquire at our Discord server if you are interested in helping out
