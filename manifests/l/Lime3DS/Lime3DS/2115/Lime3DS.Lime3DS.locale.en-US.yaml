ShortDescription: A Nintendo 3DS emulator based on Citra.
ReleaseNotes: |-
  Desktop:
  - Added configuration options to allow display stretching in Single Screen and Separated Windows layouts

  Android:
  - In-game sidebar menu can now be controlled with an external gamepad
  - Settings interface has been visually overhauled
  - Adreno Boost toggle has been added for devices with a supported GPU
      - This feature is currently experimental, so use with caution

  - Updated build dependencies
  Notes:
  - The ARM Linux flatpak has been temporarily pulled as of this update due to an issue. No active developers have access to the necessary hardware to debug this issue, so it is difficult to address. Developers with an ARM Linux device, please see issue #124 on our issue tracker for more information on how you can help.
  - In the last few weeks, development on the emulator has been slow. I have been finishing this academic year of my education, and due to being the primary maintainer of the project, this has affected the release schedule of the emulator. This should be completed by the end of July, so expect a return to a faster pace of development soon. -OpenSauce
