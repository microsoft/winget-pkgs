ShortDescription: A Nintendo 3DS emulator based on Citra.
ReleaseNotes: |-
  All:
  - Added a "Small Screen Position" feature which can be used with the Large Screen layout | @DavidRGriswold ~ #373
  Desktop:
  - Diagonal inputs for the circlepad and c-stick can now be bound from the Controls menu | @kleidis ~ #404
  - Added new command line options for the lime3ds executable which mirror those that were available with the -cli executable | @OpenSauce04 ~ #481
      - You can view these new options by running lime3ds --help
  - Fixed the labels in the Texture Filter dropdown menu being mismatched | @rtiangha ~ #454
  - Fixed an issue where Vulkan may not be available when using the Linux AppImage in a Wayland session | @OpenSauce04 ~ #504
  Android:
  - Home screen shortcuts can now be created for games using the long-press menu | @kleidis ~ #313
  - Added a fixed screen orientation setting available in the Layout section | @kleidis ~ #420
  - Updated the header of the Axis and Button dpad sections to make their purpose more clear | @DavidRGriswold ~ #464
  Technical:
  - Fixed minimum OpenGL version erroneously being internally set as OpenGL 3.1 when it is actually OpenGL 3.2 | @rtiangha ~ #477
  - Fixed issues when attempting to build Lime3DS with Qt 6.8 or later | @rtiangha ~ #441
  - The SDL2 frontend, which was previously removed in the 2118 update, has been reintroduced in the form of a command line option, however it is currently disabled at compiled time by default | @OpenSauce04 ~ #508
      - This is disabled due to the extremely unstable state that it was left in when Citra was discontinued
          - It will remain disabled until these issues are resolved
      - If you know what you are doing, you can enable it by using the ENABLE_SDL2_FRONTEND cmake option at compile time
      - The command line option to access the SDL2 frontend is --no-gui or -n for short

  Important news about the future of Lime3DS
  I have some exciting news to share about the future of the project.You may have seen on Twitter that PabloMK7 recently posted about the discontinuation of his Citra fork in favor of a new project.
  I am happy to announce that this new project won't be a solo endeavour, as this new Citra fork is a collaborative effort between both Lime3DS and PabloMK7's fork to create a new, unified project. No longer will development be fragmented between these forks, and instead all progress will be made in a single coordinated effort.As a result of this, development of Lime3DS will also be discontinued, and development time after the release of the 2119 update will be focused on getting this new project off of the ground.
  On release, the new emulator will contain features from both forks, so prior development efforts will not be lost in the transition.Further details of this new project will be shared in the coming weeks, and we hope you look forward to learning more about it.
