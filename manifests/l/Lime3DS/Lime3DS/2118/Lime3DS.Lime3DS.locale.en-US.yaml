ShortDescription: A Nintendo 3DS emulator based on Citra.
ReleaseNotes: |-
  Desktop:
  - Fixed a regression introduced in 2117 where hotkeys would not function correctly after using the settings menu | @OpenSauce04 ~ #399
  - The lime3ds-cli executable has been removed | @OpenSauce04 ~ #413
      - In its place, you are able to use the GUI program from the command line for the same purpose
      - lime3ds-gui has been renamed to simply lime3ds due to the suffix now being redundant.
  - The MacOS distribution of Lime3DS is now packaged as a zip archive instead of a tar.gz file | @OpenSauce04 ~ #415
      - There is no end-user impact from this change, it is simply made to be more familiar to other MacOS software distributions
  - Fixed the Vulkan renderer causing crashes on devices that don't support Vulkan 1.3 | @i0x404 ~ #384
  All:
  - A "Reverse Side by Side" option has been added for Lime3DS's Stereoscopic 3D mode | @OpenSauce04 ~ #393
  - The frame_limit value in the config file is now stored as a double | @OpenSauce04 ~ #385
      - This means that non-integer values can be used for more precise control of the game's framerate than was previously possible
  Android:
  - Fixed a crash which would occur after pausing the emulator | @kleidis ~ #382
  - Fixed swapping the screens on a display with a landscape aspect ratio forcing a portrait aspect ratio | @DavidRGriswold ~ #389, #390
      - This refers to devices which are designed to be used in landscape at all times, for example a modded Nintendo Switch running Android
  - There are now several set colour themes which can be chosen from in the Theme menu | @kleidis ~ #350
  - The Lime3DS app now has a Material You app icon | @OpenSauce04 ~ #400
  Technical:
  - A large-scale internal rebrand that replaces references to Citra with Lime3DS has been implemented | @rtiangha ~ #311
      - This may affect 3rd party distributors (e.g. Linux package maintainers), with things such as cmake option names being altered
  - The ENABLE_COMPATIBILITY_LIST_DOWNLOAD cmake option has been removed due to being non-functional and redundant | @OpenSauce04 ~ 6ca44de
  Notes:
  - Due to an unfortunate occurrance in my life, this update has been released without a couple of the planned features (Windows installer, pretendo support). In the near future, update 2118.1 will release to include these features. I am not sure when this will be, but it hopefully won't be more than a few weeks. Please be patient with me until then. Thanks for your support. -OS
