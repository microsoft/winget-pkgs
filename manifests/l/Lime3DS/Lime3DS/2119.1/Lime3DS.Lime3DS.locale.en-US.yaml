ShortDescription: A Nintendo 3DS emulator based on Citra.
ReleaseNotes: |-
  This release corrects an issue introduced in the 2119 update which caused desktop shortcuts to not function correctly.
  After installing this update, all existing desktop shortcuts must be removed and re-created in order to function properly.Despite the impending new emulator project, this update is being released to cap off Lime3DS in a fully usable state by correcting this issue which slipped through last minute.
  We hope you continue looking forward to more information on the new emulator project.
