  Full Changelog: https://github.com/foldynl/QLog/compare/v0.46.1...v0.46.2
  NOTE:
  1. QLog incorrectly marked the upload status for QSOs sent to LoTW and eQSL in versions 0.45.0, 0.46.0, and 0.46.1 (from July 11, 2025, to the present). If a filter using a station profile was applied to select QSOs, all QSOs matching the filter were uploaded; however, internally QLog marked as uploaded only those QSOs that matched a filter defined by callsign and gridsquare. This issue affects eQSL and LoTW uploads. Other services were not affected.
  2. There was also an issue in QLog where, when using the combination of Import QSO with the default My Profile disabled, Updated DXCC enabled, and specific imported QSOs (those containing the my_dxcc field), QLog filled the My DXCC information (my_dxcc, my_country, my_itu_zone, my_cq_zone) with data from the contacted station. To check whether you are affected, please display the My_DXCC column and verify that it contains your correct DXCC entity.
