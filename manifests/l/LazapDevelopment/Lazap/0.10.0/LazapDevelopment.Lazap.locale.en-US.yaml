ReleaseNotes: |-
  What's Changed
  After a major rewrite of the software in C++, we decided to skip v0.9.0 to emphasize how big this step is. With 0.10.0, we’re starting something new.
  In case you missed it, Lazap has undergone a significant rewrite in C++ (even the UI) to better align with the project’s core objectives. As part of this refactoring, some features have been removed to streamline development and focus on the project’s primary goals. While these features may or may not return, it'll ensure a more stable and purpose-driven evolution of Lazap.
  There won't be any specific changelog here, since this is our first baseline release of Lazap in C++, so:
  - Port Lazap from Rust/Vue (Tauri) to C++/ImGui in #162
  Full Changelog: v0.8.3...v0.10.0
