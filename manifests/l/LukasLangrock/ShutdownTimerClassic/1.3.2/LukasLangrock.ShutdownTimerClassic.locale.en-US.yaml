  How to Install
  Microsoft Store Availability: Online.
  The recommended way is to use the Microsoft Store. If this is not an option, you can always use the Windows Installer by downloading the ShutdownTimerClassic_v1.3.2_Installer.zip file instead.
  Minimum recommended version: Windows 10 Creators Update (Redstone 2 / Version 1709 / Build 15063). Older versions of Windows may still work, but not all features are guaranteed to work.
