ReleaseNotes: |-
  💾 Mirror: files.langrock.info
  This release fixes:
  - Duplicate notifications (noticeable when running in background) (#46)
  - Incorrect migration of setting file leading to "specific time of day" becoming the default (#49)
  - Application crashing when starting with invalid time values for the mode of "specific time of day" (#50)
  Known bugs: (not necessarily limited to this version)
  - Incompatibility with Windows 7 (#48)
  Notes
  Due to the incorrect migration of the settings file with the previous release, this release will revert the countdown mode to the recommended default of "timespan" (instead of the bad default "time of day").
  How to Install
  Microsoft Store Availability: Online.
  The recommended way is to use the Microsoft Store. If this is not an option, you can always use the Windows Installer by downloading the ShutdownTimerClassic_v1.3.1_Installer.zip file instead.
  Minimum recommended version: Windows 10 Creators Update (Redstone 2 / Version 1709 / Build 15063). Older versions of Windows may still work, but not all features are guaranteed to work.
