ShortDescription: Powerful screenshot capture and pinning utility to boost productivity.
Description: Snipaste is a simple but powerful snipping tool designed to boost productivity. Capture specific windows, UI elements, freehand regions, or the entire screen with ease. Enhance your captures with built-in annotation tools like rectangles, ellipses, lines, arrows, text, markers, blur, and mosaic effects. Snipaste's standout feature is the ability to pin your screenshots directly onto your desktop as floating windows. These pinned images stay on top, serving as invaluable references while you work on other tasks like coding, designing, writing, or comparing information. Pinned windows can be zoomed, rotated, made translucent, and even clicked-through. Snipaste also includes a precise color picker, capture history playback, and extensive customization options, including hotkeys. It streamlines the process of capturing, annotating, and referencing visual information.
