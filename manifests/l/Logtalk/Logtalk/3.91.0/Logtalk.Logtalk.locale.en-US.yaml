ReleaseNotes: |-
  Logtalk compiler and runtime
  - FIXED: The documentation of the logtalk::expand_library_path/2 predicate to clarify that only expands library aliases (atoms) or compound terms in library notation.
  Library
  - FIXED: Avoid a non-tail recursive predicate linter warning when loading the random library with the tail_recursive set to warning.
  Tools
  - CHANGED: The lgtunit tool messages for passed and skipped tests to also include the flaky flag.

  - FIXED: The lgtdoc tool to ignore the home and startup library names when looking for the name of the library when processing directory files.
