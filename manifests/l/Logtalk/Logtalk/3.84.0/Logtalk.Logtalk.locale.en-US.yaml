ShortDescription: Declarative object-oriented logic programming language
Description: Logtalk is a declarative object-oriented logic programming language that extends and leverages the Prolog language with modern code encapsulation and code reuse mechanisms while also providing improved predicate semantics.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Logtalk compiler and runtime
  - ADDED: New fails_if key to the info/2 predicate directive for documenting predicate fail conditions. Adopted from ECLiPSe similar fail_if key.
  - IMPROVED: Detect and report when a uses/2 directive references the object that contains it.
  - IMPROVED: Detect and report when a use_module/2 directive references the module (being compiled as an object) that contains it.
  - IMPROVED: Detect and report when an alias/2 directive references the entity that contains it.
  - IMPROVED: Detect and report when a source file attempts to load itself.
  - IMPROVED: Error reporting when a source file attempts to include itself.
  - FIXED: Prevent using grammar rules to try to redefine the (;)/2, (->)/2, and (*->)/2 control constructs.
  Documentation
  - IMPROVED: Handbook glossary entries for "predicate", "method", "sender", and "this".
  - IMPROVED: Handbook section on running parallel Logtalk processes.
  - IMPROVED: Documentation of the packs tool on working with packs using git archive URLs, signing packs, and encrypting packs.
  Library
  - CHANGED: The library object hook_pipeline/1 to not use default expansions and pass as-is any terms and goals not expanded by a hook object to the next hook object. This library object now calls the expanding protocol predicates directly instead of using the expand_term/2 and expand_goal/2 built-in methods.
  - CHANGED: The library object hook_set/1 to call the expanding protocol predicates directly instead of using the expand_term/2 and expand_goal/2 built-in methods.
  - ADDED: Predicates delete_directory_and_contents/1 and delete_directory_contents/1 to the os library.
  - ADDED: Additional tests for the dictionaries library.
  - IMPROVED: Documentation of the dictionaries library predicates.
  - FIXED: The library object type to properly load the SWI-Prolog unicode module library when running with this backend. Thanks to Alex Kouznetsov for the bug report.
  - FIXED: The definition of the os::delete_file/1 library predicate for YAP.
  - FIXED: Bug in the meta_compiler library when attempting to compile a closure for a (::)/2 (or (:)/2) goal when the object (or module) argument is not bound at compile time. Thanks to Alex Kouznetsov for the bug report.
  - FIXED: The meta_compiler library to not try to expand goals in clauses containing parameter variables. Thanks to Alex Kouznetsov for the bug report.
  Tools
  - ADDED: Support for running just a selection of tests to the lgtunit tool. Thanks to Michael McNally for the suggestion.
  - ADDED: Support to the lgtunit tool for test/2-3 test dialects as facts.
  - ADDED: Requirements section to the documentation of the help and lgtdoc tools.
  - ADDED: Support to the packs tool for installing and updating packs from local archives.
  - ADDED: Support to the packs tool for gpg encrypted pack and registry archives.
  - ADDED: Support to the packs tool to use wget in alternative to curl.
  - ADDED: Support to the packs tool to use .sig signature files in alternative to .asc signature files.
  - ADDED: Support to the tutor tool to explain selected lgtunit, make, and packs tool error messages.
  - ADDED: Additional tests for the dead_code_scanner tool.
  - IMPROVED: Tests code coverage for the packs tool.
  - IMPROVED: Man page of the logtalk_tester.sh script.
  - UPDATED: The lgtdoc tool to process the new fails_if key of the info/2 predicate directive.
  - FIXED: The dead_code_scanner tool to avoid false positives when checking predicate aliases declared in uses/2 or use_module/2 directives.
  - FIXED: The dead_code_scanner tool to not report the user-defined coinductive_success_hook/1-2 hook predicates.
  - FIXED: The lgtdoc tool to recognize consistency errors as standard exceptions.
  - FIXED: Missing space between the tar command and non-empty extra tar options in the packs tool.
  - FIXED: The logtalk_tester.sh script to follow symbolic links when looking for test driver files. Thanks to Lindsey Spratt for the bug report.
  Examples
  - ADDED: New tests_dsl example illustrating how to define a Domain Specific Language (DSL) for writing tests using a pipeline of hook objects to translate the tests to a test dialect natively supported by the lgtunit tool.
  Tests
  - ADDED: Additional tests for the Prolog standard (=)/2, (=..)/2, arg/3, clause/2, copy_term/2, functor/3, predicate_property/2, term_variables/2, and term comparison built-in predicates.
  - ADDED: Additional tests for the Prolog de facto standard clause/3 built-in predicate.
