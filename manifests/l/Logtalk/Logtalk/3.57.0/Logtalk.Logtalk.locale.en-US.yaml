ShortDescription: Declarative object-oriented logic programming language
Description: Logtalk is a declarative object-oriented logic programming language that extends and leverages the Prolog language with modern code encapsulation and code reuse mechanisms while also providing improved predicate semantics.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Logtalk compiler and runtime
  - CHANGED: When expanding the goal argument of an initialization/1, if/1, or elif/1 directive inside an entity, use any preceding, applicable uses/2 or use_module/2 directive. This is mainly useful when compiling Prolog modules as objects as the user can always write a (::)/2 or (:)/2 goal instead.
  - CHANGED: Separate linter warnings for conditionals from other suspicious calls warnings. Controlled by the new conditionals flag, whose default value is warning.
  - ADDED: Linter warnings for unknown messages sent to loaded objects (controlled by the unknown_predicates flag).
  - ADDED: Compile otherwise -> Goal and otherwise *-> Goal constructs as Goal when otherwise/0 is a built-in predicate, printing a deprecated linter warning instead of warning about a missing else part.
  - IMPROVED: Distinguish between duplicated and conflicting predicate references in multiple uses/2 or use_module/2 directives. The former are now reported as linter warnings (controlled by the duplicated_directives flag) instead of compilation errors.
  - IMPROVED: More informative permission errors for predicate conflicts in uses/2 or use_module/2 directives.
  - IMPROVED: Linter warnings for the (->)/2 and (*->)/2 control constructs.
  - IMPROVED: Text of warnings for missing predicate directives.
  - FIXED: Allow making a predicate (or non-terminal) listed in a uses/2 or a use_module/2 directive available as public, protected, or private predicate without requiring defining a protocol.
  - FIXED: Internal compiler predicate that retrieves the source file context when the compilation mode is runtime.
  - FIXED: Compiler optimization bug when calling the phrase/2-3 predicates with pre-compiled closure arguments. Thanks to Lindsey Spratt and Jacob Friedman for the bug report.

  Prolog adapter and integration files
  - UPDATED: The LVM adapter file to require version 4.1.0 or later.
  - UPDATED: The SICStus Prolog adapter file list of proprietary predicate properties.
  - FIXED: The CxProlog, SICStus Prolog, and XSB adapter files missing the meta-predicate property for the setup_call_cleanup/3 predicate when not built-in.
  - FIXED: The SWI-Prolog adapter file to recognize the new utf16le and utf16be text encoding names.

  Documentation
  - ADDED: A Handbook section on documenting predicate exceptions.
  - ADDED: Handbook sections on ports and contributions distributed with Logtalk.
  - IMPROVED: Handbook documentation of the if/1, elif/1, mode/2, and uses/2 directives.
  - IMPROVED: Handbook documentation of the logtalk::print_message/3 predicate.
  - IMPROVED: Handbook section on Prolog integration and migration.
  - IMPROVED: Handbook section on compiling Prolog modules as objects.
  - IMPROVED: The APIs documentation now include links to library descriptions in the Handbook.
  - UPDATED: The packs tool documentation section on pack signature checking.
  - UPDATED: Notes on the Windows installer.

  Library
  - CHANGED: The cvs/3 library object to use a default separator based on the extension of the file to be parsed/written when possible.
  - CHANGED: The csv library predicates read_file_by_line/2-3 to skip empty lines in CSV files.
  - CHANGED: The statistics library to depend on the types library.
  - ADDED: Library genint supporting application global and object local named generators for increasing positive integers.
  - ADDED: Predicates min_max/3 and modes/2 to the types and statistics libraries.
  - ADDED: Predicates fractile/3 and weighted_mean/3 to the statistics library.
  - ADDED: Predicate integer::sequence/4 to the types library.
  - ADDED: Support for LVM to the timeout library.
  - ADDED: Additional tests for the timeout library.
  - ADDED: Parametric objects write_to_file_hook/1-2 to the hook_objects library.
  - ADDED: Shortcut tsv object to the csv library for parsing TSV files.
  - IMPROVED: Tests for the csv library.
  - UPDATED: The gensym library to support both application global and object local generators.
  - FIXED: The arbitrary category shrink/3 predicate for number and compound types to fail instead of throwing an exception when the value to be shrink is not of the expected type.
  - FIXED: Bug in the csv library preventing parsing of TSV files in the presence of empty fields.
  - FIXED: Malformed TSV test file in the csv library.

  Tools
  - REMOVED: Support for the Sablotron XSLT processor from the lgtdoc tool.
  - CHANGED: The semantics of the packs tool directory/1 predicate for consistency with the directory/2 and readme/1-2 predicates. The old semantics are now available from the new prefix/1-2 predicates.
  - CHANGED: The packs tool restore/2 predicate to use by default the force(true) option, same as the restore/1 predicate.
  - CHANGED: The packs tool safety hooks to also accept underscores in URLs and file paths.
  - ADDED: Predicates registry_protocol::note/2 and pack_protocol::note/3 to the packs tool.
  - ADDED: Support to the packs tool for registry and pack archives using .tar.gz and .tar.bz2 extensions. Also list in documentation all valid archive formats.
  - ADDED: Support to the packs tool for passing extra command-line options to curl (e.g. for use with pack registry servers requiring authentication), bsdtar (e.g. for decrypting archives), and gpg.
  - ADDED: Support to the lgtdoc tool to generate links from library APIs to library descriptions. These links can be explicitly-qualified by using the lgt2rst scripts new -l option to pass the mapping name.
  - ADDED: Intersphinx mapping to the Logtalk APIs documentation to the Sphinx template file for the lgtdoc tool.
  - IMPROVED: The packs tool to check the availability of a new version of a pack before uninstalling the older version when updating.
  - IMPROVED: The tutor tool explanations for missing predicate directives.
  - UPDATED: The packs tool to also recognize readme files with .txt extensions to better support Prolog packs.
  - UPDATED: The tutor tool to give specific advise when the user is trying to use the common Prolog top-level shortcut for loading files as a directive.
  - UPDATED: The tutor tool for the use of deprecated (->)/2 and (*->)/2 programming idioms using a otherwise/0 built-in predicate.
  - FIXED: The packs::install/1-2 tool predicates to use all default options.
  - FIXED: Typo in two packs tool warning messages format.
  - FIXED: Workaround issues with operating-system file-systems that are not case-sensitive but are case-preserving in the implementation of the packs tool readme_file_path/2 predicate.
  - FIXED: The packs tool to only warn about a non-satisfied backend version dependency if running on that backend.
  - FIXED: Bug in the packs tool when installing a pack from a directory with some backends on Windows.
  - FIXED: Workaround ECLiPSe internal file path representation on Windows when running the packs tool tests.
  - FIXED: Workaround potential compilation issues in tools that use unification goals with ::/1-2 arguments due to user redefinition of the standard ::/1-2 Logtalk operators.
  - FIXED: Cases in the diagrams tool where excluded files would be included in generated diagrams.

  Examples
  - UPDATED: The diamonds example to illustrate using the alias/2 directive to access all inherited definitions for the same predicate.

  Tests
  - ADDED: Additional test for the meta_non_terminal/1 directive.
  - ADDED: Additional tests for the Prolog standard is/2 predicate.
  - UPDATED: Enable running the prolog/unicode/encodings test set when running on SWI-Prolog.
