ShortDescription: Declarative object-oriented logic programming language
Description: Logtalk is a declarative object-oriented logic programming language that extends and leverages the Prolog language with modern code encapsulation and code reuse mechanisms while also providing improved predicate semantics.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Logtalk compiler and runtime
  - ADDED: Predicates logtalk::loaded_files_topological_sort/1-2 for sorting loaded files by their dependencies.
  - IMPROVED: The implementation of the logtalk_make/0-1 predicates for the target all to avoid or minimize compilation warnings due to out-of-order loading of modified source files. See the make tool documentation for details.
  - FIXED: Printing of the default flag values at startup to list the prolog_dialect flag as a read-only flag.
  - FIXED: The linter warning for the use of Logtalk or Prolog top-level shortcuts as directives ignored the portability flag.
  Prolog adapter and integration files
  - CHANGED: Trealla Prolog adapter file to require version 2.84.29 or later.
  - UPDATED: ECLiPSe adapter file to use the new read_term/3 predicate line/1 option introduced in version 7.2#5 for accurate read term starting lines.
  - FIXED: CxProlog adapter file to workaround its implementation of the predicate_property/2 built-in predicate returning properties for unknown predicates.
  - FIXED: Quintus Prolog adapter file to avoid some spurious suspicious call warnings when loading tools such as lgtunit.
  - FIXED: Quintus Prolog adapter file missing expansions for some arithmetic functions.
  Documentation
  - ADDED: A "Known issues" section to the documentation of the make tool.
  - UPDATED: The Handbook on finding an optimal file loading order using the new logtalk::loaded_files_topological_sort/1-2 predicates.
  Library
  - IMPROVED: The os::time_stamp/1 predicate implementation for SICStus Prolog, Trealla Prolog, XSB, and YAP.
  - IMPROVED: Tests for the os library predicates.
  - UPDATED: The format library linter checker to be aware of the ~W control sequence that uses two arguments.
  Tools
  - IMPROVED: The logtalk_doclet.sh script now kills all created child processes on exit.
  - FIXED: Syntax error when loading the diagrams tool using the GNU Prolog backend.
  - FIXED: The logtalk_doclet.sh and logtalk_tester.sh scripts to also check for the gnutimeout alternative name for the GNU coreutils command timeout. Thanks to Andrew Davison for the bug report.
  IDEs, text editors, and syntax highlighters support
  - ADDED: Support for the Context7 MCP server via a context7.json file.
  - ADDED: VSCode support predicates infer_public_predicates/2 and files_topological_sort/3.
  - FIXED: The VSCode support to workaround the non-compliant implementation of multifile predicates in Ciao Prolog.
