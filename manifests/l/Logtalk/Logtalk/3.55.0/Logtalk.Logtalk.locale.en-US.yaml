ReleaseNotes: |-
  Prolog adapter and integration files
  - ADDED: Experimental Windows PowerShell integration scripts for selected backend Prolog systems. Collaborative work with Hans N. Beck.
  - UPDATED: The Scryer Prolog adapter file to enable modules support.

  Documentation
  - ADDED: Handbook section on customizing term writing when using the debugger tool.
  - IMPROVED: Handbook sections on objects, inheritance, defining grammar rules, and defining meta-predicates.
  - IMPROVED: Handbook section on the {}/1 control construct.
  - IMPROVED: Handbook section on Prolog nomenclature.
  - IMPROVED: Documentation of the Windows installer.

  Library
  - ADDED: Library file packs_loader.lgt for loading all installed packs.
  - UPDATED: The os::copy_file/2 library predicate for Tau Prolog to use its native definition when available.

  Examples
  - ADDED: PowerShell scripts for setting the CLASSPATH environment variable to the clustering and document_converter examples.
  - UPDATED: The dcgs example to illustrate the definition and use of meta-non-terminals.

  Tools
  - CHANGED: The diagrams, lgtdoc, and wrapper tools to convert paths to internal path syntax when normalizing directories passed as options.
  - ADDED: Experimental PowerShell versions of the update_html_docs.sh, update_svg_diagrams.sh, logtalk_allure_report.sh, logtalk_doclet.sh, and logtalk_tester.sh scripts.
  - IMPROVED: Documentation of the issue_creator and packs tools.
  - UPDATED: Documentation of the lgtdoc tool for the new PowerShell scripts.
  - UPDATED: The lgtdoc tool lgt2pdf.sh script to support using the FOP 2.x processor.
  - FIXED: The lgtdoc Bash shell scripts help text content failed to list the version option.
  - FIXED: Broken lgtdoc tool logtalk_entity_to_txt.xsl file.
  - FIXED: The lgtdoc tool lgt2txt.sh script to use the correct XSLT files.
  - FIXED: The lgtdoc tool lgt2rst.sh script to generate correct index.rst files when indexing a directory of XML documenting files without any index XML file.
  - FIXED: The logtalk_doclet.sh script usage help function omission of the path suppress option.
  - FIXED: The logtalk_doclet.sh script spurious but harmless warnings when no doclets are found.
  - FIXED: The logtalk_tester.sh script to also detect timeouts using signal

  Tests
  - ADDED: Basic tests for the new occurs_check flag that is becoming de facto standard.
  - ADDED: Additional tests for the Prolog unbounded integer arithmetic support.
  - ADDED: Additional tests for the Prolog standard (*)/2, (/)/2, (^)/2, (**)/2, and div/2 arithmetic functions.
  - ADDED: Sanity tests for Prolog standard (+)/1-2, (-)/1-2, and (\)/1 arithmetic functions.
  - ADDED: Integer overflow tests for the succ/2 and plus/3 predicates.
  - ADDED: Additional tests for the Prolog standard retract/1, retractall/1, subsumes_term/2, and write_term/3 predicates.
  - ADDED: Additional test for the de facto standard (*->)/2 control construct.
  - IMPROVED: Tests for the Prolog standard (//)/2 arithmetic function.
  - FIXED: Portability of the Prolog de facto standard (*->)/2 control construct tests.

  Installers and installation scripts
  - CHANGED: The embedding scripts default values for the paths and settings files to, respectively, paths.pl and settings-embedding-sample.lgt.
  - CHANGED: The Windows installer and the logtalk_user_setup.ps1 script to no longer make available the deprecated .js JScript scripts and their corresponding .bat files in the system path (replaced by the PowerShell scripts).
  - ADDED: Experimental Windows PowerShell logtalk_user_setup.ps1 script. Collaborative work with Hans N. Beck.
  - ADDED: Experimental Windows PowerShell embedding scripts for selected backends. Collaborative work with Hans N. Beck.
  - IMPROVED: Sample embedding script examples and documentation.
  - UPDATED: Sample embedding scripts to allow specifying the temporary directory to be used for intermediate files. This option is required for some backends when running the scripts on windows.
  - UPDATED: The update_html_docs.sh and update_svg_diagrams.sh scripts to optionally generate packs documentation and diagrams.
  - UPDATED: The Windows installer to copy the PowerShell integration and setup scripts to the system directory.
  - FIXED: The Windows installer to detect additional YAP installations.
  - FIXED: The logtalk_user_setup.js script to avoid an error when creating the symbolic link to the lgt2svg.js script.
  - FIXED: Outdated but harmless commands in the logtalk_user_setup.sh script.
  - FIXED: Broken but not required sanity test in the update_html_docs.sh and update_svg_diagrams.sh scripts.
  - FIXED: The update_html_docs.sh and update_svg_diagrams.sh scripts when using some of the non-default backends.

  IDEs, text editors, and syntax highlighters support
  - UPDATED: Documentation of the Visual Studio Code text editor Logtalk plug-in.
