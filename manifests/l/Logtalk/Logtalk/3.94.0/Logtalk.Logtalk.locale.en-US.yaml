ShortDescription: Declarative object-oriented logic programming language
Description: Logtalk is a declarative object-oriented logic programming language that extends and leverages the Prolog language with modern code encapsulation and code reuse mechanisms while also providing improved predicate semantics.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Logtalk compiler and runtime
  - ADDED: Object and category references/2 property for querying entity references in calls to the execution-context built-in methods and in directives for multifile predicates/non-terminals not covered by other properties.
  - ADDED: Linter warning for entity parameter variables not in parameter variable syntax. Controlled by the naming linter flag.
  Documentation
  - FIXED: Incomplete documentation of the discontiguous/1 directive.
  Tools
  - CHANGED: The lgtunit tool code coverage linter warnings to be printed when compiling the tests instead of when printing the code coverage results.
  - ADDED: Support for creating entity specific predicate breakpoints to the debugger tool.
  - UPDATED: The tutor tool to explain the new linter warning for entity parameters not in parameter variable syntax.
  - FIXED: The debugger tool to not change from debugging with breakpoints to tracing for the next top-level query if the trace/0 predicate was not used.
  - FIXED: The debugger tool to allow creating a triggered breakpoint that depends on a clause breakpoint for a parametric entity.
  - FIXED: Preliminary diagrams tool support for Mermaid resulted in syntax errors with recent Mermaid versions.
  Examples
  - UPDATED: The errors example to illustrate additional linter warnings.
  Tests
  - ADDED: Additional tests for the object_property/2 and category_property/2 built-in predicates.
  IDEs, text editors, and syntax highlighters support
  - CHANGED: VSCode support for finding predicate references no longer includes predicate declarations.
  - ADDED: VSCode support for finding predicate declarations and definitions from a (@)/1 goal.
  - FIXED: VSCode support error when trying to find predicate references from an alias/2 directive with a protocol or category in its first argument.
  - FIXED: VSCode support failure to find a predicate declaration from a clause for a multifile predicate or from a multifile/1 predicate directive.
  - FIXED: VSCode support find_references/4 predicate bug where some references would be missed in the case of parametric entities.
  - FIXED: VSCode support find_references/4 predicate bug where predicate references in alias/2 directives would be missed.
