ShortDescription: Declarative object-oriented logic programming language
Description: Logtalk is a declarative object-oriented logic programming language that extends and leverages the Prolog language with modern code encapsulation and code reuse mechanisms while also providing improved predicate semantics.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Logtalk compiler and runtime
  - CHANGED: The clause/3 method support to allow the first two arguments to be unbound if the third argument is bound as per the de facto standard.
  - CHANGED: Shorter warning message when a possibly incompatible backend Prolog compiler version is detected.
  - ADDED: Support for using object aliases in the message delegation control construct.
  - IMPROVED: Simplified folding of left unifications when compiling clauses in optimized mode.

  Prolog adapter and integration files
  - ADDED: GNU Prolog adapter file support for inlining calls to foreign predicates.
  - UPDATED: The GNU Prolog adapter file table of proprietary predicate properties.
  - UPDATED: The LVM adapter file to require version 3.0.0 or later.
  - UPDATED: The SWI-Prolog adapter file tables of proprietary predicate properties and candidate tautology and falsehood goals.
  - UPDATED: The Trealla Prolog adapter file to require version 1.20.12 or later.
  - UPDATED: The Trealla adapter file table of candidate tautology and falsehood goals.
  - FIXED: Skipping of discontiguous predicate clauses warnings in the SICStus Prolog adapter file.
  - FIXED: Override the meta-predicate template for the current_op/3 built-in predicate in the SWI-Prolog adapter file.

  Documentation
  - ADDED: Handbook section on calling Prolog foreign predicates.
  - IMPROVED: Documentation of the options library.
  - IMPROVED: Documentation of the logtalk_tester automation script.
  - IMPROVED: Documentation of the phrase//1 built-in method.
  - FIXED: Sidebar links between the Handbook and the APIs from pages other than the root pages.

  Library
  - ADDED: Predicates option/2-3 to the options library.
  - ADDED: Support to the timeout library for the Trealla Prolog backend.
  - IMPROVED: Tests driver files for the arbitrary and random libraries to avoid reloading of files and and to explicit clean up intermediate files for the code being tested.
  - UPDATED: The dif and coroutining libraries for use with the LVM and Trealla Prolog backends.
  - UPDATED: The os library for fixes in the upcoming SICStus Prolog 4.7.1 version.
  - FIXED: The timeout library for the YAP backend.
  - FIXED: Deleted unused predicate in the git library.
  - FIXED: The intervals library f/2 shortcut for the finishes/2 predicate.

  Tools
  - CHANGED: The packs tool delete commands on Windows to use the force option.
  - ADDED: New experimental tool, issue_creator, for automatically creating bug report issues for failed tests in GitHub or GitLab servers.
  - ADDED: Command-line option to the logtalk_tester script to setup and use the new issue_creator tool.
  - IMPROVED: The packs tool handling of deleted registries.
  - UPDATED: Added git command to the requirements list for the packs tool.
  - UPDATED: The diagrams, lgtdoc, and packs tools to use the options library option/2 predicate.
  - UPDATED: The help tool to use the atomic_list_concat/2 predicate.
  - FIXED: The lgtunit tool error message for a failed test step.

  Ports
  - CHANGED: The metagol port to skip three long running tests when the tests are run automated.
  - UPDATED: The metagol port to run when using LVM as the backend compiler.
  - FIXED: Workaround Metagol port find_duplicate example portability issue to avoid failures when run on backends that type-check the second argument of the msort/2 predicate.

  Examples
  - UPDATED: The attvars example tests to use explicit assertions.
  - UPDATED: The figures example to run using the LVM and Trealla Prolog backends.

  Tests
  - CHANGED: Tests for Logtalk settings file to avoid issues with some backends where reloading files can be problematic.
  - ADDED: Additional test for the standard throw/1 control construct when the exception term is a cyclic term.
  - ADDED: Tests for invalid quoted atoms that contain layout characters.
  - ADDED: Tests for invalid double-quoted terms that contain layout characters.
  - ADDED: Tests for the Prolog lsb/1 and msb/1 built-in functions when available.
  - ADDED: Additional tests for the standard term comparison, bagof/3, compare/3, copy_term/2, findall/3, ground/1, length/2, numbervars/3, setof/3, and subsumes_term/2 predicates with cyclic term arguments.
  - ADDED: Additional tests for the standard get_byte/1-2, get_char/1-2, get_code/1-2, open/4, put_byte/1-2, put_char/1-2, put_code/1-2, sort/2, and write_term/3 predicates.
  - ADDED: Additional tests for the de facto standard predicate_property/2 and msort/2 predicates.
  - ADDED: Test set for the de facto standard Prolog built-in predicates that take a clause reference argument.
  - ADDED: Additional tests for the database built-in methods that take a clause reference argument.
  - IMPROVED: Simplify the tests driver file for the Logtalk use_module/2 directive.
  - UPDATED: The tests for the length/2 predicate to also check the Ciao Prolog library definition of the predicate.

  IDEs, text editors, and syntax highlighters support
  - ADDED: Experimental vscode_message_streamer category for supporting the new version of the Visual Studio Code text editor Logtalk plug-in. Contributed by Jacob Friedman.

  Installers and installation scripts
  - ADDED: Trealla Prolog embedding script.
