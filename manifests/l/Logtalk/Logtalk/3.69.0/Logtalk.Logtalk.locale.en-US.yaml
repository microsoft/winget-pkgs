ShortDescription: Declarative object-oriented logic programming language
Description: Logtalk is a declarative object-oriented logic programming language that extends and leverages the Prolog language with modern code encapsulation and code reuse mechanisms while also providing improved predicate semantics.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Logtalk compiler and runtime
  - FIXED: Compilation of read_term/2-3 and write_term/2-3 goals would fail to take into account local operator definitions when the portability flag was set to silent (its default value).
  Prolog adapter and integration files
  - UPDATED: The LVM adapter file list of proprietary predicate properties for version 6.4.0.
  - FIXED: Workaround a LVM embedding application issue with plug-ins where the registry name differs from the shared library basename.
  Documentation
  - IMPROVED: Documentation of the op/3 directive.
  - IMPROVED: Documentation of the asserta/1 and assertz/1 built-in methods.
  - IMPROVED: Documentation of the diagrams tool path_url_prefixes/3 and omit_path_prefixes/1 options.
  - IMPROVED: Documentation of the lgtunit tool on writing and running tests.
  Library
  - ADDED: Experimental os::full_device_path/1 library predicate. Currently limited to Linux and BSD systems.
  - ADDED: Experimental os::read_only_device_path/1 library predicate. Currently limited to macOS systems.
  - ADDED: Predicate approximately_equal/2 to the number library object.
  - IMPROVED: The number object documentation of the approximately_equal/3 and essentially_equal/3 predicates.
  Tools
  - CHANGED: The lgtunit tool to handle a non-deterministic success test result as any other test failure (thus suppressing non_deterministic_success/6 print messages).
  - ADDED: Predicate approximately_equal/2 to the lgtunit tool.
  - ADDED: The lgtunit tool now supports a flaky/0 test option as the preferred solution for declaring flaky tests.
  - IMPROVED: The lgtunit tool documentation of the approximately_equal/3 and essentially_equal/3 predicates.
  - IMPROVED: The diagrams tool DOT language support no longer sets the graph pack attribute to true to avoid frequent Graphviz dot command crashes when converting graphs to SVG format.
  - IMPROVED: The lgtdoc tool support for documenting libraries where source files are organized in multiple sub-directories.
  - IMPROVED: The tutor tool explanations for some message sending warnings.
  - FIXED: The lgtunit tool xUnit reports escaping of XML special characters.
  - FIXED: Bug in the packs tool warning message when installing a pack requires updating the backend Prolog system. Thanks to Jacob Friedman for the bug report.
  Examples
  - IMPROVED: The metapredicates example.
  - UPDATED: The document_converter example to allow converting large files and to turn off OCR for faster testing. Also added samples in formats other than PDF. Tested with Apache Tika 2.8.0.
  Tests
  - ADDED: Additional tests for the Logtalk op/3 directive for checking the semantics of the read_term/2-3, read/1-2, write_term/2-3, writeq/1-2, and write/1-2 predicates in the presence of local operator definitions.
  Installers and installation scripts
  - UPDATED: The LVM embedding scripts to support encryption of the generated Prolog files. Requires LVM 6.4.0 or later version.
  IDEs, text editors, and syntax highlighters support
  - UPDATED: Link to the new home for the VSCode Logtalk plug-in.
