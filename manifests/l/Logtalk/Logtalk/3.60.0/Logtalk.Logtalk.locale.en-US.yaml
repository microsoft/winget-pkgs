ShortDescription: Declarative object-oriented logic programming language
Description: Logtalk is a declarative object-oriented logic programming language that extends and leverages the Prolog language with modern code encapsulation and code reuse mechanisms while also providing improved predicate semantics.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Logtalk compiler and runtime
  - ADDED: Linter check for the availability of predicates (and non-terminals) listed in uses/2 and use_module/2 directives. Controlled by the flag unknown_predicates.
  - IMPROVED: Readability of default flag values printed at startup.
  - FIXED: When reporting calls to non-standard arithmetic functions don't describe them as built-in functions as most Prolog systems fail to provide reflection support to check or enumerate built-in functions.

  Prolog adapter and integration files
  - UPDATED: All backend adapter files to recognize .pro as a valid Prolog file name extension.
  - UPDATED: The Scryer Prolog adapter file to require version 0.9.1 or later.

  Documentation
  - ADDED: New lgtunit tool documentation section on working with test data files.
  - IMPROVED: The Handbook inheritance section on the predicate lookups order.
  - IMPROVED: The Handbook pages on some predicate directives by linking to the corresponding glossary definitions.
  - UPDATED: The manual installation instructions in the INSTALL.md file for zsh users.

  Library
  - ADDED: New json library parsing source line(Stream) to parse a single line from the given stream into a JSON term.
  - ADDED: Support for alternative term representations of JSON objects and JSON pairs to the json library.
  - FIXED: Bug in the json library handling of JSON escape sequences.
  - ADDED: Library reader::line_to_chars/2-3 predicates.
  - FIXED: Mode directives for the reader::line_to_codes/2-3 predicates.
  - FIXED: Also declare as synchronized the term_io predicates read_term_from_chars/4 and read_term_from_codes/4.

  Tools
  - CHANGED: Renamed the lgtdoc tool lgtdoc_missing_periods linter flag to lgtdoc_missing_punctuation and accept also exclamation and question marks.
  - ADDED: New linter warning to the lgtdoc tool for invalid dates in info/1 directives.
  - ADDED: New lgtunit tool file_path/2 protected predicate for computing absolute paths for file paths relative to test object paths.
  - IMPROVED: The lgtdoc tool linter warnings to include the file line number.
  - IMPROVED: More portable checking of the packs tool required command-line executables in POSIX systems.
  - FIXED: The logtalk_doclet.sh script when using a backend Prolog system that requires command-line passed queries to end with a period.
  - FIXED: The logtalk_tester.sh script to ensure that the searching for a tester.sh file to be sourced is restricted to the test set directory.
  - FIXED: The logtalk_tester.ps1 script sourcing of tester.ps1 files found in the test set directory.
  - FIXED: List of dependencies for the developer tools for Ubuntu.

  Examples
  - IMPROVED: Documentation of the people example.
  - FIXED: Test for the jpl example to correctly compare floats.

  Tests
  - ADDED: Additional tests for the Prolog standard atom_chars/2, atom_codes/2, number_chars/2, and number_codes/2 predicates.
  - UPDATED: Several Prolog compliance tests to use the new lgtunit tool file_path/2 predicate.

  Installers and installation scripts
  - IMPROVED: The logtalk_user_setup.sh and logtalk_user_setup.ps1 scripts to detect when the LOGTALKHOME and LOGTALKUSER environment variables point to the same directory and refuse to run.

  IDEs, text editors, and syntax highlighters support
  - ADDED: Support for escape sequences inside double-quoted terms to most text editors and syntax highlighters.
  - UPDATED: Syntax highlighting test files to test escape sequences inside double-quoted terms.
  - FIXED: Deleted accidentally committed temporary files in the coding/tests directory.
