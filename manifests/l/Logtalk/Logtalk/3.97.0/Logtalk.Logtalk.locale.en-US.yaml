ShortDescription: Declarative object-oriented logic programming language
Description: Logtalk is a declarative object-oriented logic programming language that extends and leverages the Prolog language with modern code encapsulation and code reuse mechanisms while also providing improved predicate semantics.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Logtalk compiler and runtime
  - FIXED: Expansion of source file arguments to the logtalk_compile/1-2 and logtalk_load/1-2 built-in predicates to avoid spurious file redefinition warnings when the file paths contain '.' or '..' segments.
  Documentation
  - UPDATED: The Handbook documentation of the include/1 directive with a mention of the limited support for nested included files.
  - UPDATED: The man page for the logtalk_allure_report.sh script.
  - UPDATED: The settings-sample.lgt file with initialization code for defining the help tool preferred browser.
  Library
  - ADDED: New ccsds library for parsing and generating CCSDS (Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems) Space Packets following the CCSDS 133.0-B-2 standard (Space Packet Protocol).
  - ADDED: New toon library implementing the TOON (Token-Oriented Object Notation) format proposal.
  Tools
  - CHANGED: The debugger tool silent messages for the current unification ports to include the head of the clause.
  - CHANGED: The help tool to use a terminal-based browser or the default browser to open documentation for all features. Removed support for browsing the Texinfo versions of the documentation due to issues with recent Texinfo and Sphinx versions.
  - CHANGED: The diagrams tool directory and library dependency diagrams to always output the root directory and library nodes.
  - CHANGED: The logtalk_allure_report scripts to update the previous report while preserving the tests run history when the allure-report directory already exists.
  - ADDED: Support to the lgtdoc tool for converting XML documenting files to HTML 5 files.
  - IMPROVED: The debugger tool documentation on breakpoints.
  - FIXED: The lgtunit tool to correctly report the location of tests defined in included files.
  - FIXED: Removed redundant goal in the diagrams::all_files/0-1 predicates implementation.
  - FIXED: Removed redundant goal in the tools_doclet example.
  - FIXED: Removed redundant tests for the diagrams and lgtdoc tools while keeping the same code coverage.
  Examples
  - ADDED: Locked doors puzzle to the searching example.
  - UPDATED: The testing example tests so that the number of run/skipped tests is independent of the double_quotes flag standard values.
  Tests
  - ADDED: Additional tests for the de facto standard format/2-3 predicates from the PIP-0110 standardization work.
  - ADDED: Additional tests for unbounded integers when used as arguments to the format/2-3 predicates.
  Installers and installation scripts
  - UPDATED: The Windows installation script to also detect ECLiPSe 7.2 versions.
  - FIXED: The Windows installer to support running in system context for deployment via enterprise management tools.
  - FIXED: The Windows installer to support the base installation (with /COMPONENTS="base" without requiring a user documents folder.
  IDEs, text editors, and syntax highlighters support
  - UPDATED: The VSCode support to create debug data files that include the clause heads besides the source file name and line number.
  - UPDATED: The VSCode support for more compact display of tests coverage.
  - FIXED: The VSCode support use of the atomic_list_concat/2 predicate to work will all backends.
  - FIXED: The VSCode support for ECLiPSe file paths on Windows when finding the enclosing entity from a file position.
  - FIXED: Bug in the VSCode support where calls to a local predicate would not be found.
  - FIXED: The VSCode support handling of included files when looking for local predicate declarations, definitions, and references.
