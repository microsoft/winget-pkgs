ShortDescription: Declarative object-oriented logic programming language
Description: Logtalk is a declarative object-oriented logic programming language that extends and leverages the Prolog language with modern code encapsulation and code reuse mechanisms while also providing improved predicate semantics.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Logtalk compiler and runtime
  - ADDED: Compilation warning when compiling a logtalk_load_context/2 goal with an invalid key.
  - ADDED: Linter warning for non-terminals called as predicates instead of via the phrase/2-3 built-in methods.
  - FIXED: Detect conflicts between dynamic/1 directives and uses/2 and use_module/2 directives.
  - FIXED: The compiler to not throw an instantiation error when the body of a clause is a variable; these clauses are conformant with the ISO Prolog Core standard and this fix also ensures consistency of the handling of naked variables in transparent control constructs.

  Prolog adapter and integration files
  - ADDED: Support for calling LVM disk predicate built-in predicates from categories.
  - UPDATED: The Trealla Prolog adapter file to require version 2.2.5 or later.

  Documentation
  - IMPROVED: Handbook documentation of the initialization/1 directive and the logtalk_load_context/2 built-in predicate.
  - UPDATED: List of required dependencies to build the Handbook final formats.

  Library
  - CHANGED: Use a portable os::is_absolute_file_name/1 predicate definition for all backends for consistency and improve the predicate documentation.
  - REMOVED: Support for the type clause_or_partial_clause from the types and arbitrary libraries.
  - ADDED: New [] and {} edge cases for atoms to the arbitrary library.
  - FIXED: The os library delete_directory/1, directory_files/2, environment_variable/1, and file_permission/2 predicates for YAP.
  - FIXED: The definition of the type clause in the types and arbitrary libraries to allow a naked variable body as per the ISO Prolog Core standard.

  Tools
  - CHANGED: The help tool to provide a dedicated entity/1 predicate for help on entities (objects, protocols, or categories).
  - CHANGED: The lgtunit::quick_check/3 predicate now uses reified error/4 and failed/3 results that include as last argument the test seed.
  - CHANGED: The lgtunit tool now reports an error on wrong QuickCheck options instead of silently using default option values.
  - ADDED: A convenient global list of most of the developer tool requirements per operating-system.
  - ADDED: Experimental support to the help tool to browse and search inline at the top-level interpreter the Texinfo versions of the Handbook and APIs documentation. Currently requires Ciao Prolog, ECLiPSe, LVM, SICStus Prolog, SWI-Prolog, Trealla Prolog, or XSB as the backend running on a POSIX system.
  - ADDED: The lgtunit QuickCheck test dialects and predicates now also accept a pb/2 option to show an ASCII progress bar.
  - IMPROVED: The lgtunit::quick_check/1-2 predicates now also print the test seed when a counter-example is found.
  - IMPROVED: The lgtunit tool documentation of the test/2-3 test dialect valid outcomes.
  - IMPROVED: The help tool feedback when the queried library or entity is not found.
  - IMPROVED: The tutor tool explanation for the linter warning on findall/3 goals used to backtrack over all solutions of a goal without collecting them.
  - UPDATED: The tutor tool for the new linter warning on non-terminals being called as predicates.
  - FIXED: Missing message tokenization in the packs tool when printing a pack/registry installation directory.

  Examples
  - UPDATED: Reorganize all Net-Clause Language (NCL) examples in the new examples/ncl directory, including the figures individual example.
  - UPDATED: The errors example to illustrate the new linter warning on non-terminals being called as predicates.
  - FIXED: Typo in the sample queries of the document_converter example.
  - FIXED: The adventure and bench examples linter warnings for non-terminals called as predicates.

  Tests
  - ADDED: Additional tests for the atom_concat/3, number_chars/2, number_codes/2, and setof/3 standard Prolog predicates.
  - ADDED: Additional test for the optional '|' infix operator for a compliant definition.
  - ADDED: Additional tests for double-quoted terms syntax (escaped double-quote).

  Ports
  - ADDED: Port of FCube: An Efficient Prover for Intuitionistic Propositional Logic by Mauro Ferrari, Camillo Fiorentini, and Guido Fiorino.

  Contributions
  - FIXED: The xml_parser contribution linter warnings for non-terminals called as predicates.

  IDEs, text editors, and syntax highlighters support
  - ADDED: Code snippets for Emacs. Contributed by Paul Brown.

  Installers and installation scripts
  - ADDED: Experimental PowerShell version of the built_manuals.sh script.
  - ADDED: Experimental embedding script for Ciao Prolog.
  - IMPROVED: Documentation of the sample embedding scripts.
  - IMPROVED: Simplified embedding scripts for ECLiPSe.
  - UPDATED: The manual install script and the Linux RPM installer to create links to the .info versions of the Handbook and APIs documentation in the default info directory.
  - UPDATED: The release build script to include all final formats for the Handbook and APIs documentation in the generated archives and installers.
  - FIXED: The update_man_html_versions.sh, update_html_docs.*, and update_svg_diagrams.* scripts to allow running them from any directory.
