ShortDescription: Declarative object-oriented logic programming language
Description: Logtalk is a declarative object-oriented logic programming language that extends and leverages the Prolog language with modern code encapsulation and code reuse mechanisms while also providing improved predicate semantics.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Logtalk compiler and runtime
  - IMPROVED: Simplified implementation of the threaded_engine_destroy/1 built-in predicate.
  - FIXED: Workaround SWI-Prolog throwing existence errors when calling thread_signal/2 or thread_send_message/2` on a terminated but not yet joined thread.
  Prolog adapter and integration files
  - UPDATED: The Trealla Prolog adapter file to set the threads and engines flags to supported when running on a recent version providing the required built-in predicates.
  Documentation
  - IMPROVED: Handbook documentation of the threaded_engine_self/1 built-in predicate.
  - IMPROVED: Documentation of the arbitrary library.
  Library
  - ADDED: New os library predicates operating_system_name/1, operating_system_machine/1, and operating_system_release/1.
  - ADDED: New compound(Name,Types) and types_frequency(Pairs) types to the types and arbitrary libraries. Joint work with Yurii Rashkovskii.
  Tools
  - CHANGED: The lgtunit tool now prints both CPU time and wall time for tests.
  - CHANGED: The lgtunit tool xUnit reports now use the tests wall time instead of CPU time.
  - FIXED: The packs linter for pack definitions would not recognize the (\==)/2 operator as valid when specifying dependencies.
  Examples
  - ADDED: Additional test for the document_converter example.
  - ADDED: Tests for the tbbt threaded engine example.
  - IMPROVED: Tests for the barriers blackboard, buckets, buffer, checkpoint, metered_concurrency, philosophers, ping_pong, sorting, and team multi-threading examples by using explicit assertions.
  - IMPROVED: Portability of the whisper multi-threading example.
  - UPDATED: The buckets, buffer, metered_concurrency, tbbt, and whisper multi-threading examples to use the format library.
  - UPDATED: The buckets multi-threading example to call the thread_yield/0 predicate in the redistribute and match loops.
  - UPDATED: The ebench threading engines example tests for LVM.
  - FIXED: The threads/team example to allow running it independently of the current directory.
  Tests
  - ADDED: Test set for ISO Prolog standard logical update semantics.
  - ADDED: Additional test for the ISO Prolog standard op/3 predicate.
  - ADDED: Additional tests for the de facto Prolog standard format/2-3 predicates (~p control sequence).
  - IMPROVED: Test for the ISO Prolog standard current_op/3 predicate.
