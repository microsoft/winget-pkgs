ShortDescription: Declarative object-oriented logic programming language
Description: Logtalk is a declarative object-oriented logic programming language that extends and leverages the Prolog language with modern code encapsulation and code reuse mechanisms while also providing improved predicate semantics.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Logtalk compiler and runtime
  - ADDED: Predicate directive mode_non_terminal/2 to distinguish non-terminal mode declarations from predicate mode declarations.
  - UPDATED: The logtalk built-in object to use the new mode_non_terminal/2 directive.
  Prolog adapter and integration files
  - UPDATED: The XSB adapter file with an implementation of the predicate that converts between internal and native file system paths.
  Documentation
  - UPDATED: Simplified page titles in the HTML versions of the Handbook and APIs documentation.
  Library
  - UPDATED: The grammars library to use the new mode_non_terminal/2 directive.
  Tools
  - CHANGED: The diagrams tool predicate_url_target_format/1 option to only accept sphinx and other values.
  - IMPROVED: The diagrams tool generated diagram node links by encompassing just the relevant text.
  - IMPROVED: The lgtunit tool lint checking of test assertions.
  - UPDATED: The tutor tool to explain the new lgtunit tool linter warnings.
  - UPDATED: The lgtunit tool to allow using failed_test_reason//1 as a public non-terminal to better support IDEs such as VSCode.
  - UPDATED: The code_metrics, help, lgtdoc, and tutor tools for the new mode_non_terminal/2 directive.
  - UPDATED: The dead_code_scanner tool for additional tests using use_module/2 directives.
  - UPDATED: The diagrams tool to also load the Mermaid experimental support.
  - FIXED: A lgtdoc tool bug when reporting missing predicate directives for declared non-terminals.
  - FIXED: A lgtdoc tool bug when reporting missing predicate directives when the scope directive is found in an included file.
  - FIXED: The lgtdoc tool logtalk.css file to avoid rendering issues when viewing documentation in VSCode.
  - FIXED: The lgtdoc tool XSLT files for converting XML documentation files to (X)HTML files to correctly handle italic, bold, and monospaced text fragments.
  - FIXED: The diagrams tool to exclude the default scratch directory on Windows (lgt_tmp) when generating diagrams for all sub-directories or sub-libraries.
  - FIXED: The diagrams tool generated entity cross-referencing diagrams to link to the entity definition line instead of just to the entity definition file.
  - FIXED: Some documentation formatting issues in the wrapper tool.
  Examples
  - UPDATED: The dcgs, includes, and searching examples tests to report code coverage.
  Contributions
  - UPDATED: The verdi_neruda and xml_parser contributions to use the new mode_non_terminal/2 directive.
  IDEs, text editors, and syntax highlighters support
  - ADDED: New entity and predicate definition predicates to the VSCode support to allow navigating to entities, predicates, and clauses from profiling views.
  - ADDED: New test predicates to the VSCode support to allow running all tests defined in a file or in an object.
  - UPDATED: The format of the VSCode support generated file with test results.
  - UPDATED: The VSCode support diagram predicates to use the url_prefixes/2 and zoom/1 options to allow opening code and documentation links in VSCode itself.
  - UPDATED: The VSCode support diagram predicates to accept a format argument.
  - UPDATED: The syntax highlighting support for all supported text editors and syntax highlighters for the new mode_non_terminal/2 directive.
  - FIXED: Some typos in the syntax highlighting test files.
  - FIXED: The VSCode support to avoid leaking stream aliases in case of unexpected errors.
  - FIXED: The VSCode support handling of code coverage for non-terminals.
  Installers and installation scripts
  - FIXED: The build_release.sh script building of the SVG diagrams.
