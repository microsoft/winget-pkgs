ReleaseNotes: |-
  Logtalk compiler and runtime
  - CHANGED: Linter warnings on suspicious cuts in disjunctions are now controlled by the disjunctions flag.
  - CHANGED: Linter warnings on calling Logtalk/Prolog top-level shortcuts or Logtalk built-in predicates as directives are now controlled by the portability flag.
  - CHANGED: The deprecated assert/1 predicate is no longer declared as a built-in method.
  - ADDED: Support for runtime constructed messages for the built-in methods. Thanks to Alex Kouznetsov for the bug report.
  - FIXED: The handling of include/1 directives by the create_protocol/3, create_object/4, and create_category/4 built-in predicates to throw an error instead of failing when the included file is not valid. Thanks to Alex Kouznetsov for the bug report.
  - FIXED: The message term of the linter warning for a missing predicate scope directive when an info/2 or mode/2 directive exists would misreport the existing directive.
  - FIXED: Duplicated linter warnings when checking if (\=)/2 goals are always true or false.
  Prolog adapter and integration files
  - CHANGED: The default value of the underscore_variables linter flag to dont_care for all supported backends.
  Documentation
  - IMPROVED: Handbook documentation of the underscore_variables linter flag.
  - IMPROVED: Handbook documentation of the logtalk::message_prefix_stream/4 predicate.
  - FIXED: Handbook documentation of the logtalk::ask_question/5 predicate. Thanks to Paul Brown for the bug report.
  Library
  - CHANGED: The arbitrary library check if null is a valid character for the current backend to not rely on exceptions but instead use the backend identifier.
  Tools
  - ADDED: Tests for the linter tool.
  - IMPROVED: The packs tool handling of alternative pack dependencies.
  - IMPROVED: Man page of the packs tool lgtenv script.
  - UPDATED: The lgtenv scripts to support specifying the name of the packs sub-directory.
  - FIXED: The logtalk_allure_report scripts when using both the single page and title options. Allure 2.26.0 or a later version is now required.
  Tests
  - ADDED: Additional tests for the include/1 directive.
  - ADDED: Additional tests for the built-in database and reflection methods.
  - ADDED: Additional test for the Prolog standard unify_with_occurs_check/2 built-in predicate.
  Installers and installation scripts
  - ADDED: Portable Docker image support for displaying man pages.
  - ADDED: Portable Docker image support for displaying the Handbook and the APIs Texinfo files using the help tool.
  - FIXED: The Docker file for building the portable image to properly define the INFOPATH and MANPATH environment variables.
  - FIXED: The macOS portfile for the changes in the MacPorts 2.10 version.
