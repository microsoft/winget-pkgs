ShortDescription: Declarative object-oriented logic programming language
Description: Logtalk is a declarative object-oriented logic programming language that extends and leverages the Prolog language with modern code encapsulation and code reuse mechanisms while also providing improved predicate semantics.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Logtalk compiler and runtime
  - ADDED: Support for the see_also key to the info/2 predicate directive.
  - FIXED: The definition of the user built-in object to also create an object events queue when threaded engines are supported but not other multi-threading features.

  Prolog adapter and integration files
  - ADDED: Commented out code to the SICStus Prolog adapter file for disabling compilation messages for the intermediate Prolog files generated by the Logtalk compiler.
  - UPDATED: The LVM adapter file for its proprietary disk_predicate and spy predicate properties and to expand its disk_predicate/3 directive and define_disk_predicate/3 predicate.
  - UPDATED: The JIProlog adapter file to require 4.1.7.1 or later version.
  - UPDATED: The Trealla Prolog adapter file to require 1.11.25 or later version.
  - FIXED: The adapter files expansion code for directives to check that the directives argument is bound.

  Documentation
  - ADDED: An example to the lgtunit tool documentation on generating reports with links to the tests source files and line numbers.
  - IMPROVED: Handbook section on documenting applications.
  - IMPROVED: Handbook documentation of the use_module/1 and threaded/0 directives.
  - IMPROVED: Handbook documentation of the multi-threaded, threaded engines, logtalk_library_path/2 and logtalk_compile/1-2 predicates.
  - IMPROVED: Man page for the logtalk_tester shell script.
  - IMPROVED: The lgtunit tool documentation on suppressing tested predicates output and on generating Allure reports.
  - IMPROVED: The diagrams tool documentation and examples.
  - UPDATED: The man page for the lgt2svg shell script.
  - FIXED: Typo in the Handbook documentation of the phrase/2-3 built-in method exception conditions.

  Library
  - CHANGED: The library list object no longer uses the backend built-in length/2 predicate when available due to differences between backend implementations.
  - ADDED: Additional tests for the arbitrary and types libraries to check that the main predicates are deterministic.
  - FIXED: The meta_compiler library to include a copy of the meta library tests to avoid names clashes when generating Allure reports from test results.
  - FIXED: Workaround JIProlog file_attributes/7 predicate succeeding for non-existing files in the implementation of the os library predicates directory_files/2, file_modification_time/2, and file_size/2.
  - FIXED: Workaround JIProlog directory_files/2 predicate succeeding for non-existing directories in the implementation of the os::directory_files/2 library predicate.

  Tools
  - ADDED: Command-line option to the logtalk_tester script to pass a base URL for generating links to test files using the new tests_base_url user-defined flag that is created by the lgtunit tool test results export formats.
  - ADDED: Support for the Saxon XSLT processor to the lgtdoc tool lgt2rst, lgt2html, lgt2md, and lgt2txt scripts.
  - ADDED: A custom.css file to the lgtdoc tool for use with the lgt2rst scripts when called with the -s option to customize the Sphinx Read the Docs theme.
  - IMPROVED: The lgt2rst scripts now supports a -m option to generate Sphinx HTML files without requiring a separate step.
  - IMPROVED: The diagrams tool to also normalize URL prefixes in predicate options.
  - IMPROVED: Performance of the diagrams tool tests by generating diagrams for a smaller library.
  - UPDATED: The lgt2svg scripts provided by the diagrams tool to allow specifying the Graphviz command to use.
  - UPDATED: The lgt2svg scripts provided by the diagrams tool to use the dot command -ofile option for improved Windows compatibility.
  - UPDATED: The lgtunit tool xUnit.net v2 XML format report to generate links to test files when using the new logtalk_tester script command-line option to pass the base URL.
  - UPDATED: Mention the GNU coreutils package requirement for the timeout option in the help for the logtalk_tester script.
  - UPDATED: The lgtdoc tool to process the new see_also key for the info/2 predicate directive.
  - FIXED: The lgtunit tool xUnit.net v2 XML format report to append the tests object identifier to the test names to distinguish tests run with different parameterizations.
  - FIXED: Sample Sphinx template provided by the lgtdoc` tool for compatibility with recent Sphinx versions.
  - FIXED: Tests driver file for the arbitrary library to use the local source file.

  Examples
  - IMPROVED: Avoid printing expected errors and warnings when running the assumptions, lambdas, securemp, and closed_world_assumption example tests.
  - FIXED: Loading of the securemp example to actually load all the demo broken meta-predicate definitions.
  - FIXED: The lambdas_compiled and metapredicates_compiled examples to include copies of, respectively, the lambdas and metapredicates example tests to avoid names clashes when generating Allure reports from test results.

  Tests
  - REMOVED: Duplicated tests for the standard false/0 predicate.
  - ADDED: Additional tests for the de facto standard forall/2, format/2-3, and length/2 predicates.
  - ADDED: Additional tests for the standard atom_chars/2, atom_codes/2, atom_concat/3, number_chars/2, number_codes/2, stream_property/2, and sub_atom/5 predicates. Some of them taken or derived from the WG17 test suite.
  - ADDED: Additional tests for the standard keysort/2 and sort/2 predicates.
  - ADDED: Additional tests for the standard floating-point number syntax.
  - ADDED: Additional tests for the setup_call_cleanup/3 predicate.
  - ADDED: Additional unit tests for the 0'\Char number notation.
  - ADDED: Additional tests for the de facto standard \uXXXX and \UXXXXXXXX syntax.
  - ADDED: Additional tests for the syntax of atoms, compound terms, and variables using Unicode glyphs.
  - IMPROVED: Avoid printing expected warnings when running the encoding/1 directive tests.
  - IMPROVED: Tests for the write_term/3 predicate option `variable_names/1.
  - UPDATED: The tests for the standard open/4 and write_term/2-3 predicates for the for the changes in the ISO/IEC 13211-1 Technical Corrigendum 3:2017 in options checking where an instantiation error is now expected instead of a domain error.
  - UPDATED: Allow the Unicode encodings test set to be run with Trealla Prolog.
  - RENAMED: Tests for the standard float/1 function and predicate to workaround tests with the same names clashing when generating an Allure report from test results using the xUnit.net v2 XML output format.
  - RENAMED: Tests for the set_logtalk_flag/2 directive and predicate to workaround tests with the sane names clashing when generating an Allure report from test results using the xUnit.net v2 XML output format.
  - FIXED: Tests for the threaded engine predicates to also run with ECLiPSe.

  IDEs, text editors, and syntax highlighters support
  - FIXED: Parsing of compiler error and warning messages when building with the Sublime Text editor.

  Installers and installation scripts
  - UPDATED: The Windows installation script to also detect SICStus Prolog 4.7.x versions.
