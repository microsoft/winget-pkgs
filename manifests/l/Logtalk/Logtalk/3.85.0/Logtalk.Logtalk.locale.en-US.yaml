ShortDescription: Declarative object-oriented logic programming language
Description: Logtalk is a declarative object-oriented logic programming language that extends and leverages the Prolog language with modern code encapsulation and code reuse mechanisms while also providing improved predicate semantics.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Logtalk compiler and runtime
  - CHANGED: The logtalk_load_context/2 built-in predicate to type-check the key argument.
  - CHANGED: Attempting to define an entity/predicate alias equal to the original entity/predicate is now a compilation error instead of simply a warning.
  - CHANGED: Reclassified the underscore_variables flag as a backend flag instead of a linter flag.
  - ADDED: New meta-flag, linter, to manage the values of all the linter flags as a group.
  - ADDED: New linter flag, encodings, to control source file text encoding warnings.
  - ADDED: New linter flag, general, for warnings that are not controlled by a specific flag.
  - IMPROVED: Print a linter warning on redundant entity qualification in predicate directives.
  - IMPROVED: Detect and report as compilation errors use_module/1-2 and uses/1-2 directives when compiling a protocol.
  - IMPROVED: Report as compilation errors instead of compilation warnings use_module/1-2 directives when not compiling a module as an object while using a backend that doesn't support modules.
  - IMPROVED: Report as compilation errors export/1 and reexport/2 directives when not compiling a module as an object.
  - FIXED: The compiler to prevent trying to compile a Prolog use_module/1 directive as a Logtalk directive when compiling a module as an object.
  - FIXED: Detection of a file trying to recursively load itself to not throw a permission error when reloading a file that previously failed to load.
  - FIXED: Misleading error when compiling dynamic/1, discontiguous/1, and multifile/1 directives with arguments with redundant entity qualification.
  Prolog adapter and integration files
  - UPDATED: Trealla Prolog adapter file to require version 2.59.21 or later.
  Documentation
  - IMPROVED: Documentation of the issue_creator tool.
  - IMPROVED: The Handbook documentation on performance, adding a section on circular references.
  - IMPROVED: The Handbook documentation on the logtalk_make/0-1 built-in predicates.
  - UPDATED: The Handbook documentation on the underscore_variables flag.
  Library
  - ADDED: Additional test for the java library checking setting an array element to the empty list atom.
  - UPDATED: The meta_compiler library to support optimization of meta-calls with closure meta-arguments that are messages to parametric objects.
  Tools
  - ADDED: Support to the diagrams tool for VSCode, VSCodium, Cursor, Zed, BBEdit, MacVim, and TextMate local file links.
  - UPDATED: Rewrite error and warning messages from the packs tool so that they can be explained by the tutor tool.
  - UPDATED: The tutor tool to explain the new redundant entity qualifier linter warning.
  - FIXED: Case where the packs tool would print repeated "Pack dependency not available" error messages when trying to install or update a pack with alternative dependencies where none is available.
  - FIXED: The debugger tool description of the p (print) port command.
  - FIXED: Typos in the mode/2 directives for the debuggerp protocol logging/3 and nolog/3 public predicates.
  - FIXED: Typo in the info/2 directive for the tutor object explain//1 public non-terminal.
  - FIXED: Harmless linter warning when loading the debugger tool with some backends.
  Examples
  - IMPROVED: The searching example representation of some of the problems.
  - UPDATED: The errors example for the new redundant entity qualifier linter warning.
  - FIXED: Portability issue in the errors example tests.
  - FIXED: Cannot run the module_aliases example with XSB and Tau Prolog.
  - FIXED: The symbiosis example for Trealla Prolog removing its apply module.
  Tests
  - CHANGED: Tests for the Prolog standard initialization/1 directive to not depend on support for the ensure_loaded/1 directive.
  - ADDED: Additional tests for the user built-in entity.
  - ADDED: Tests for the Logtalk consistency_error/3 built-in method.
  - ADDED: Additional tests for the Prolog standard bagof/3 and setof/3 built-in predicates.
  - ADDED: Tests for the Prolog standard write_term/2-3 built-in predicates support for the portrayed/1 option implemented by most systems.
  - ADDED: Tests for the Prolog de facto standard print/1-2 built-in predicates and the portray/1 user-defined hook predicate.
  - ADDED: Additional tests for the de facto Prolog standard format/2-3 predicates (~p control sequence).
  - IMPROVED: Tests for the de facto standard Prolog built-in predicates that take a clause reference argument.
  - FIXED: Compilation errors when running the always_true_or_false_goals and deprecated linter flag tests with XSB.
  - FIXED: Missing condition in test for Unicode UTB-8 (no BOM) encoding.
  - FIXED: Portability issue when running the tests for the Prolog standard call/1 control construct and call/N built-in predicates with JIProlog.
  Installers and installation scripts
  - UPDATED: The Trealla Prolog embedding scripts to create a loader.pl file when the application loader option is provided.
  - UPDATED: The CxProlog, ECLiPSe, Trealla Prolog, and XVM embedding scripts to accept an optional startup application goal argument.
