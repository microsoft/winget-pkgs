ShortDescription: Declarative object-oriented logic programming language
Description: Logtalk is a declarative object-oriented logic programming language that extends and leverages the Prolog language with modern code encapsulation and code reuse mechanisms while also providing improved predicate semantics.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Logtalk compiler and runtime
  - ADDED: Allow info/2 directive examples key examples to also use {true} and {false} for bindings.
  - FIXED: Spurious linter warnings of unknown calls to user predicates (and non-terminals) listed in uses/2 and use_module/2 directives when the predicates (and non-terminals) are also declared as dynamic or multifile in the same entity.
  - FIXED: Spurious suspicious call linter warnings when compiling calls to threaded meta-predicates. Thanks to Didier Garcin for the bug report.
  - FIXED: Linter warning for message-sending calls sent from an object to itself to check that it calls a locally defined predicate. Thanks to Paul Brown for the sample code.
  - FIXED: Compiler optimization for message-sending calls sent from an object to itself to only apply when calling a locally defined predicate.
  Documentation
  - ADDED: Handbook section on compiler formatting of errors, warnings, and comments.
  Library
  - IMPROVED: Documentation of the random library randomize/1 predicate. After feedback from Jonathon Doran.
  Tools
  - ADDED: GNU Prolog (1.5.1 or later version) support for the help tool experimental predicates for top-level inline browse and search of the Texinfo versions of the Handbook and APIs documentation.
  - IMPROVED: Performance of the diagrams tool when generating library dependency diagrams.
  - IMPROVED: The logtalk_tester.sh script to exit with an error code when the find command used to find test sets fails to recognize an option.
  - FIXED: The logtalk_tester.sh script -e option to work on Linux. Thanks to Lindsey Spratt for the bug report.
  Examples
  - ADDED: New units example, a Logtalk version of a GNU Prolog/CX parametric unit example.
  - FIXED: Unknown module predicate linter warnings in the constraints/sicstus example due to the length/2 and member/2 predicates being built-in.
  Tests
  - ADDED: Additional tests for the de facto Prolog standard format/2-3 predicates.
  - ADDED: Additional tests for the setup_call_cleanup/3 predicate adapted from the WG17 standardization proposal.
  IDEs, text editors, and syntax highlighters support
  - UPDATED: Syntax completion keywords for the jEdit, Sublime Text, TextMate, and Vim text editors.
