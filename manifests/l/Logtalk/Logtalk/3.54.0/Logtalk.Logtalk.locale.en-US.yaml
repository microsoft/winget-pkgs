ShortDescription: Declarative object-oriented logic programming language
Description: Logtalk is a declarative object-oriented logic programming language that extends and leverages the Prolog language with modern code encapsulation and code reuse mechanisms while also providing improved predicate semantics.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Logtalk compiler and runtime
  - ADDED: Linter warning for catch/3 goals that catch all exceptions by using an anonymous variable in the second argument. Controlled by the new catchall_catch flag, whose default value is silent.
  - ADDED: Linter warning for missing predicate scope directive when a info/2 directive exists.
  - ADDED: Support to user-defined linter warning messages for suspicious calls.
  - FIXED: Ensure that intermediate Prolog files are disregarded when reloading a file due to different compilation flags instead of timestamp differences when compiling with the clean flag turned off.

  Prolog adapter and integration files
  - UPDATED: The Ciao Prolog adapter file to require version 1.21.0 or later.
  - UPDATED: The LVM adapter file to require version 3.3.0 or later.
  - UPDATED: The Scryer Prolog adapter file to require version 0.9.0 or later.
  - UPDATED: The Tau Prolog adapter file to require version 0.3.2 or later.
  - UPDATED: The Trealla Prolog adapter file to require version 1.23.14 or later.
  - UPDATED: The ECLiPSe adapter file to suppress intermediate Prolog file compilation log messages when compiling and loading Logtalk source files.

  Documentation
  - ADDED: Handbook section on the logic and control built-in public methods.
  - ADDED: Handbook documentation for the new catchall_catch linter flag.
  - IMPROVED: Documentation of the git library.
  - IMPROVED: Documentation of the developer tools on applying them to plain Prolog code.
  - IMPROVED: Handbook documentation on the term-expansion mechanism.
  - UPDATED: The packs tool documentation on known issues.
  - FIXED: Mention the soft-cut control construct in the Handbook section on messages broadcasting.
  - FIXED: Portability notes in the documentation of the format library.
  - FIXED: The settings-sample.lgt sample code for handling third-party libraries to avoid an endless loop due to the packs support. Note that this sample code is deprecated by the packs tool. Thanks to Paul Brown for the bug report.

  Library
  - CHANGED: The set(_Type_) object now takes into account the comparingp protocol. Thanks to Adrián Arroyo Calle for his contribution.
  - CHANGED: The basic_types library loader to also load the comparingp protocol.
  - CHANGED: The types library termp protocol to extend the comparingp protocol and the term and number objects to provide implementations of the comparison predicates.
  - CHANGED: Implementation of the os::copy_file/2 library predicate for Trealla Prolog to use the new native built-in predicate introduced in version 1.23.14.
  - ADDED: New grammars library providing DCGs for common parsing tasks.
  - ADDED: New union_find library, a portable port of a Prolog library written by José Antonio Riaza Valverde.
  - ADDED: Predicates group_sorted_by_key/2 and group_consecutive_by_key/2 to the pairs library object. Deprecated the group_by_key/2 predicate.
  - ADDED: Linter checks for format/2-3 goals to the format library.
  - ADDED: Parametric object  object_wrapper_hook/2 to the hook_objects library.
  - ADDED: Implementation for the os::copy_file/2 library predicate for Ciao Prolog, ECLiPSe, JIProlog, and Tau Prolog.
  - ADDED: Types in_character, in_character(CharSet), in_character_code, in_character_code(CharSet), and in_byte to the arbitrary and types libraries.
  - IMPROVED: Performance of the csv library when parsing large CSV files.
  - IMPROVED: The type library object implementation of the atom(CharSet), atom(CharSet, Length), and non_empty_atom(CharSet) types to avoid using catch/3 goals.
  - FIXED: Two tests for the nested_dictionaries library that used unification goals as assertions.
  - FIXED: Implementation of the os::file_permission/2 predicate for Ciao Prolog to throw an exception on non-existing files.
  - FIXED: Implementation of the os library predicates change_directory/2 and directory_files/2 for Scryer Prolog to throw an exception on non-existing directories.
  - FIXED: Implementation of the os::change_directory/2 library predicate for YAP to throw an exception on a non-existing directory.
  - FIXED: The os library date_time/7 and operating_system_type/1 predicates for Scryer Prolog when the double_quotes flag is set to codes.
  - FIXED: Implementation of the os library shell/1 and sleep/1 library predicates for B-Prolog when running on Windows.
  - FIXED: The os::path_concat/3 library predicate to use the os::is_absolute_file_name/1 predicate to check for absolute paths.
  - FIXED: Tests for the json library to be run only once.

  Tools
  - CHANGED: The lgtunit tool to allow sharing variables between a test body and its setup/1 and cleanup/1 options. Thanks to Trystan Lapointe-Majumdar for the use case.
  - ADDED: A lgtunit tool lint check for the use of unification goals in test outcome assertions.
  - ADDED: Predicate packs::outdated/1 to list outdated packs from a registry.
  - IMPROVED: Performance of the ports_profiler tool.
  - UPDATED: The help tool for the new Handbook logic and control method pages.
  - UPDATED: The tutor tool to explain compiler warnings when using the new catchall_catch linter flag.
  - UPDATED: The Windows lgt2rst.js JScript to provide the same support for a user-defined custom.css file when called with the -s option to customize the Sphinx Read the Docs theme as found in the lgt2rst.sh Bash script.
  - IMPROVED: The performance of the ports_profiler tool.
  - IMPROVED: The lgtunit::run/1 predicate to print a warning on unknown tests.
  - FIXED: The lgtdoc tool lgt2rst scripts to avoid an error when called with the -s option due to changes in recent versions of the Sphinx sphinx-quickstart command.
  - FIXED: The lgtunit::run/1 predicate when the test defines setup/1 or cleanup/1 options. Thanks to Trystan Lapointe-Majumdar for the bug report.
  - FIXED: The logtalk_tester script to only setup and use the issue_creator tool when the -b option is used as per documentation.
  - FIXED: The packs tool tests that construct URLs to escape spaces.
  - FIXED: The packs tool to decode file URL encoded spaces when extracting directory paths.

  Examples
  - CHANGED: The tests for the metapredicates and metapredicates_compiled examples to not require setting the double_quotes flag.
  - UPDATED: The errors example to illustrate the new catch/3 lint check.
  - UPDATED: The roots example to use the existence_error/2 built-in method.
  - IMPROVED: The dcgs individual usage example of the meta_non_terminal/1 directive.
  - FIXED: Float comparison in test for the dcgs example.

  Tests
  - CHANGED: The number_codes/2 standard predicate tests to not require setting the double_quotes flag.
  - ADDED: Additional test for the Prolog standard catch/3 control construct. Suggested by Andrew Davison.
  - ADDED: Additional test for the Prolog de facto standard (*->)/2 control construct. Suggested by Andrew Davison.
  - ADDED: Additional tests for the Prolog standard arg/3, copy_term/2, keysort/2, sort/2, term_variables/2, unify_with_occurs_check/2, write_term/3, read_term/3, and (=..)/2 predicates.

  - ADDED: Additional tests for unbound integers when used in functor/3 and arg/3 predicate calls.
  - ADDED: Additional tests for the length/2 de facto standard predicate.
  - UPDATED: The tests for the setup_call_cleanup/3 predicate to also run using the Scryer Prolog backend.
  - FIXED: Tests for the bagof/3, term_variables/2, and write_term/3 standard predicates that used unification goals as assertions.
  - FIXED: Tests for the format/2-3 de facto standard predicates that used unification goals as assertions.
  - FIXED: Avoid a linter warning from the lgtunit tool in a Unicode test for variable unification.
