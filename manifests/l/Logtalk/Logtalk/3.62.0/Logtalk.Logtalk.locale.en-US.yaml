ShortDescription: Declarative object-oriented logic programming language
Description: Logtalk is a declarative object-oriented logic programming language that extends and leverages the Prolog language with modern code encapsulation and code reuse mechanisms while also providing improved predicate semantics.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Logtalk compiler and runtime
  - ADDED: Message token tab(Expression) to the logtalk built-in object.

  Prolog adapter and integration files
  - UPDATED: Simplify integration script for Trealla Prolog.

  Documentation
  - UPDATED: Man pages of integration scripts that accept a command-line option for silencing informative messages.
  - FIXED: Permanently redirected and broken hyperlinks in the Handbook and developer tools documentation.

  Library
  - ADDED: Preliminary version of sequence grammar rules to the grammars library.
  - IMPROVED: Documentation of the hook_objects library.
  - FIXED: Workaround issue with the SWI-Prolog implementation of the standard initialization/1 directive by skipping two tests of the timeout library.

  Tools
  - ADDED: Option to the logtalk_tester.sh and logtalk_tester.ps1 scripts for excluding directories using a regular expression.
  - ADDED: New debugger tool port option to skip debugging for the current goal but displaying all intermediate ports unleashed.
  - ADDED: New debugger tool port option to read and throw and exception term (as in the SICStus Prolog debugger).
  - ADDED: Experimental lgtenv.sh and lgtenv.ps1 scripts for creating packs virtual environments.
  - ADDED: New packs tool available/2 and versions/3 predicates.
  - ADDED: New update/1 option to the packs tool registry adding and pack installation predicates.
  - IMPROVED: The diagrams tool lgt2svg.sh and lgt2svg.ps1 scripts to alert the user when one or more files could not be converted (usually due to Graphviz crashes).
  - UPDATED: The update_svg_diagrams.sh script to exit with the same code as the called lgt2svg.sh script.
  - UPDATED: The packs tool to also recognize as a valid registry and pack readme file name case variations of NOTES with or without a .md or .txt extension.
  - FIXED: Document packs tool predicates possible exceptions.
  - FIXED: Missing type-checking of some arguments of some of the packs tool predicates.
  - FIXED: The debugger tool to consume any new-line code after the user answers a question at a leashed port to avoid an automatic creep when returning to the port after calling the goal.

  Examples
  - FIXED: Portability issue in the bench example that prevented running the flatten benchmark with some backend Prolog systems.
  - FIXED: Avoid a linter warning when loading the assumptions example.

  Tests
  - ADDED: Additional tests for the Prolog standard sub_atom/5 predicate. Contributed by Lindsey Spratt from the LVM development work.
  - ADDED: Additional test for the Prolog standard unify_with_occurs_check/2 predicate.
  - ADDED: Additional test for the de facto Prolog standard format/2-3 predicates for the ~0f format specifier. Test case contributed by Andrew Davison.
  - ADDED: Additional tests for the de facto Prolog standard format/2-3 predicates for the case where the number of arguments is larger than required by the format string.
