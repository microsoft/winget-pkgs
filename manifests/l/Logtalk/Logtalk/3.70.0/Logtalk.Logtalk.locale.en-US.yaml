ShortDescription: Declarative object-oriented logic programming language
Description: Logtalk is a declarative object-oriented logic programming language that extends and leverages the Prolog language with modern code encapsulation and code reuse mechanisms while also providing improved predicate semantics.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Logtalk compiler and runtime
  - ADDED: Linter check for missing arithmetic functions when using a backend implementing the evaluable_property/2 predicate.
  - IMPROVED: The compiler to optimize the compilation of catch/3 goals where the first argument is a call/1 goal.
  Prolog adapter and integration files
  - FIXED: The GNU Prolog adapter file to rely on the new show_banner flag (when available) instead of the new show_information flag (in the upcoming 1.6.0 release) to set the Logtalk report flag.
  Documentation
  - IMPROVED: Documentation of the embedding scripts, notably on how to ensure relocatable applications.
  - UPDATED: The man pages of the logtalk_doclet and logtalk_tester scripts on generating a GNU Prolog executable that includes Logtalk.
  - FIXED: Override default Pygments CSS style for syntax highlighting errors in the Handbook to avoid displaying red boxes in non-Logtalk code blocks.
  Libraries
  - ADDED: Additional tests for the java library conversion between non-ASCII Java strings and Prolog atoms.
  Tools
  - IMPROVED: The packs tool handling of pack dependencies to try first to select dependency versions that verify any Logtalk and Prolog backend requirements before resorting to versions that just comply with the parent pack requirements.
  - UPDATED: The logtalk_allure_report scripts to support generating single file reports when running Allure 2.24.0 or a later version.
  - UPDATED: The packs tool to print an error message when updating a pack fails unexpectedly.
  - FIXED: The packs::update/0 predicate to use default options for updating the outdated packs.
  Examples
  - IMPROVED: The document_converter example for faster conversion of large PDF files.
  Tests
  - ADDED: Additional Unicode tests for the standard sub_atom/5 predicate.
  Installers and installation scripts
  - ADDED: All the embedding scripts now support omitting a settings file by using the -s none option.
  - FIXED: All the embedding scripts to use the default value for the settings file if none is specified (using the -s option) as per documentation.
