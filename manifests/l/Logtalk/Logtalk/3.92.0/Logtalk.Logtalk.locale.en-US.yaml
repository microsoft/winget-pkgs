ShortDescription: Declarative object-oriented logic programming language
Description: Logtalk is a declarative object-oriented logic programming language that extends and leverages the Prolog language with modern code encapsulation and code reuse mechanisms while also providing improved predicate semantics.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Logtalk compiler and runtime
  - FIXED: The compilation of rules listed in the last argument of the create_object/4 built-in predicate so that the clause/2 built-in method correctly returns the original rule body instead of its compiled version.
  - FIXED: The exception terms used for object existence errors thrown by the asserta/1-2 built-in methods.
  - FIXED: Typo in the documentation of the forwarding protocol forward/1 predicate.
  Prolog adapter and integration files
  - UPDATED: Trealla Prolog adapter file for the deprecation of the consult/1 built-in predicate in version 2.68.11.
  - UPDATED: The XVM adapter file for the renaming in version 11.x of the unify_applies_occurs_check flag to enable_occurs_check.
  Documentation
  - CHANGED: Moved APIs documentation to the docs/apis directory. Moved the man pages to docs/man. Moved the Handbook to docs/handbook. Fixed the documentation and installation scripts for the new locations.
  - CHANGED: Moved the update_html_docs.* and update_svg_diagrams.* scripts from the scripts directory to the docs/apis/sources directory. Renamed the update_html_docs.* scripts to build.*. Renamed the build_manuals.* scripts to build.*.
  - CHANGED: Moved the sample files to a samples directory.
  - ADDED: Glossary entries for "flaky test", "test dialect", "test outcome", "mocking", "term-expansion", and "goal-expansion".
  - IMPROVED: Documentation on writing multi-threading applications that call built-in predicates and built-in methods with side-effects.
  - IMPROVED: Documentation on the CPU and wall time accuracy in the lgtunit tool and the os library.
  - UPDATED: The Handbook section on performance.
  - FIXED: Typo in the sample code for user-defined test dialects in the lgtunit tool documentation. Thanks to Paul Brown for the bug report.
  Library
  - ADDED: New json_lines library implementing the JSON Lines format proposal (available at https://jsonlines.org).
  - ADDED: Library predicate integer::power_sequence/4.
  - FIXED: Workaround spurious choice-point in the avltree::delete/4 library predicate when using the SWI-Prolog backend on Windows.
  Tools
  - CHANGED: The packs tool to never install or update to a pack version with a experimental or deprecated status unless the version is explicitly specified using the install/3-4 or update/2-3 predicates.
  - ADDED: Support for an experimental status to pack definitions.
  - ADDED: A status/1 option to the packs tool update/2-3 predicates to allow restricting the required status for pack updates.
  - ADDED: New predicates outdated/5 and outdated/2 to the packs tool.
  - IMPROVED: The packs tool predicates restore/1-2 error messages.
  - UPDATED: The help tool for the new location of the Handbook.
  Examples
  - IMPROVED: Tests of the blackboard, buffer, and philosophers multi-threading examples.
  - IMPROVED: The mtbatch multi-threading example to support parameterization of the individual benchmarks.
  - UPDATED: The coinduction example for the XVM 11.x renaming of the flag unify_applies_occurs_check to enable_occurs_check.
  - UPDATED: The SWI-Prolog backend specific pengines example to not require the gui flag set to true.
  - UPDATED: The lips example test to try to avoid a divide by zero error with fast backends.
  - FIXED: The buffer multi-threading example to prevent potential deadlocks.
  - FIXED: The engines/pmq example tester.lgt file loading the library pairs object twice in different compilation modes.
  - FIXED: Formatting typo in the coinduction example NOTES.md file that caused an error when open as a Jupyter notebook.
  - FIXED: The neo4j example set_classpath.ps1 script to assume that Neo4j Desktop is installed in its default location.
  Tests
  - ADDED: Additional test for the clause/2 built-in method.
  - FIXED: Tests for the logtalk_library_path/2 built-in predicate when run on Windows systems that don't define the HOME environment variable.
  Installers and installation scripts
  - CHANGED: The build_release.sh script to also include the APIs documentation when building the manuals archive.
  - UPDATED: The portable Docker image to include the JAR files required by the apache_poi, clustering, and document_converter examples.
  - IMPROVED: Simplified the Docker files for the portable and SWI-Prolog images.
  - IMPROVED: The manual installation script to also print the required MANPATH environment variable setting.
