ShortDescription: Declarative object-oriented logic programming language
Description: Logtalk is a declarative object-oriented logic programming language that extends and leverages the Prolog language with modern code encapsulation and code reuse mechanisms while also providing improved predicate semantics.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Logtalk compiler and runtime
  - CHANGED: The reflection API now also includes calls/2 object and category properties when the callers are auxiliary predicates. This change allows the dead_code_scanner tool to avoid false positives when reporting non called predicates.
  - ADDED: Implemented the object and category updates/2 property alias/2 and non_terminal/1 predicate properties.
  - IMPROVED: The compiler report of errors and warnings clause context for multifile predicates.
  - IMPROVED: Print a warning only for the first successful call to the logtalk_linter_hook/7 hook predicate.
  - FIXED: The compiler to detect and report attempts to declare category predicates or non-terminals as both multifile and dynamic.
  - FIXED: The updates/2 object and category property would not be reported for updated predicates in user.
  - FIXED: The compiler to not create object and category calls/2 properties for built-in database predicate calls updating predicates in user.
  - FIXED: False positive missing predicate linter warnings in logtalk_make/1 calls for the check target when analyzing (^^)/1 and (::)/1 calls from objects playing the role of instances.
  Documentation
  - IMPROVED: Clarify that license information in info/1 directives and pack manifest files should preferably use a SPDX standard license identifier.
  - IMPROVED: Documentation of the diagrams tool on known issues when generating predicate call cross-referencing diagrams.
  - FIXED: Handbook description of object and category calls/2 and updates/2 properties missing the non_terminal/1 predicate property and wrongly specifying as/2 instead of alias/2 predicate property.
  Library
  - CHANGED: No longer require arbitrary term generators to have a type-checker.
  - CHANGED: The type::check/2 and the arbitrary::arbitrary/2 predicates are now also declared as meta-predicates to support new meta-types.
  - REMOVED: The types_frequency/1 type from the type library (use instead the types/1 type for type-checking).
  - ADDED: New (::)/2 and constrain/2 types to the types and arbitrary libraries. This (::)/2 type allows using object public predicates as scoped type-checkers, generators, and shrinkers. The constrain/2 type allows constraining a base type using a closure.
  - ADDED: New transform/2 type to the arbitrary library. This type allows transforming generated values of a base type using a closure.
  - ADDED: New arbitrary::max_size/1 multifile predicate to allow overriding the maximum size for types where its meaningful and implicit.
  - ADDED: New arbitrary::shrink_sequence/3 predicate to help testing definitions of the arbitrary::shrink/3 predicate.
  - IMPROVED: Linter warnings for calls to the list::append/3 predicate.
  - FIXED: Bugs in the arbitrary library shrink/3 predicate definitions for some of the pre-defined types that could result in non-terminating sequences.
  - FIXED: Protect arbitrary library shrink/3 predicate definitions for float types from underflow errors.
  - FIXED: The arbitrary library tests when run with the GNU Prolog backend.
  - FIXED: Deleted unused non-terminals from the number_grammars/1 object.
  - FIXED: Tests for the ulid library to account for some backends providing low time accuracy.
  - IMPROVED: Implementation of the os library predicates full_device_path/1 and read_only_device_path/1.
  Tools
  - CHANGED: The diagrams tool interpretation of the excluded_directories/1 option to exclude also all sub-directories of the excluded directories.
  - CHANGED: The lgtdoc tool interpretation of the excluded_paths/1 option to exclude also all sub-directories of the excluded directories.
  - ADDED: New public predicates to the dead_code_scanner tool that take a list of options to selectively exclude from analysis libraries, directories, files, and entities.
  - ADDED: Support to the packs tool to represent operating-system dependencies in pack manifest files.
  - IMPROVED: The logtalk_tester.sh script can now be interrupted using Ctrl-C when the timeout option is used.
  - IMPROVED: The logtalk_tester.sh script now kills all created child processes on exit.
  - IMPROVED: The tutor tool explanation for permission errors when trying to declare a category predicate as both multifile and dynamic.
  - IMPROVED: The packs tool to clean the pack installation directory when restoring or (re)installing a pack from an archive.
  - FIXED: The packs tool to respect the verbose(true) option when adding or updating packs and registries from directories.
  - FIXED: The packs tool lint checking of pack manifest notes.
  - FIXED: Test for the packs tool when running on Windows with backends that convert paths to lower case.
  - FIXED: The dead_code_scanner tool to not report non-terminals and predicates listed in uses/2 or use_module/2 directives when a local scope directive exists or when they are used only as arguments in calls to the built-in database methods.
  - FIXED: The dead_code_scanner tool to report unused non-terminals and predicates listed in uses/2 or use_module/2 directives when aliases are defined.
  - FIXED: The diagrams tool predicate call cross-referencing diagrams to ensure that caller nodes are not created for auxiliary predicates.
  - FIXED: The logtalk_tester.ps1 script reporting of broken test sets when the tests cannot be compiled due to syntax errors.
  - FIXED: Workaround a XSB command-line options handling bug on Windows in the logtalk_tester.ps1 script.
  Examples
  - ADDED: Additional tests for the hooks example.
  Ports
  - FIXED: The metagol port learn_with_timeout/4 predicate definition.
  Contributions
  - FIXED: Unused predicate warnings when analyzing the pddl_parser, verdi_neruda, and xml_parser contributions using the dead_code_scanner tool.
  - FIXED: Linter warnings for the verdi_neruda contribution with backends not providing a statistics/2 built-in predicate.
  Tests
  - IMPROVED: Tests for the standard stream_property/2 built-in predicate.
  - FIXED: Tests for the get_char/2, get_code/2, and peek_char/2 standard predicates that caused failures when run on Windows.
