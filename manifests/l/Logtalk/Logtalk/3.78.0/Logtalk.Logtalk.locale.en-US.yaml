ShortDescription: Declarative object-oriented logic programming language
Description: Logtalk is a declarative object-oriented logic programming language that extends and leverages the Prolog language with modern code encapsulation and code reuse mechanisms while also providing improved predicate semantics.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Logtalk compiler and runtime
  - ADDED: Linter warning for left-recursion in clauses and grammar rules. Controlled by the new left_recursion flag with default value warning.
  - ADDED: Object and category alias/2 property for object and module aliases declared using the uses/1 and use_module/1 directives. Also added the alias properties object, module, and predicate.
  - ADDED: Object and category declares/2, defines/2, alias/2,, calls/2, updates/2, includes/3, and provides/3 properties now include an entity and predicate lines/2 property.
  - FIXED: Bug where the entity properties includes/3 and provides/3 could be missing after reloading modified source files containing predicate multifile directives.
  Documentation
  - ADDED: A glossary definition for homoiconic programming languages.
  - IMPROVED: Handbook section on declarative object-oriented programming.
  - UPDATED: Handbook documentation on developer tools requirements.
  - UPDATED: The help tool documentation on known issues.
  - UPDATED: Notes on the VSCode and VSCodium text editors support.
  Tools
  - UPDATED: The tutor tool to explain the new linter warning for left-recursion in clauses and grammar rules.
  - FIXED: Dependency on non-standard predicate in the dead_code_scanner tool.
  - FIXED: Harmless Texinfo warning when using the help::man/1 predicate.
  Examples
  - IMPROVED: Documentation of the shapes example.
  - UPDATED: The errors example to illustrate the new linter warning for left-recursion in clauses and grammar rules.
  - UPDATED: The multifile example to also illustrate multifile non-terminals.
  - FIXED: Spurious choice-points in the blocks and bricks examples.
  - FIXED: The SICStus Prolog specific constraints/sicstus example to not depend on the default double_quotes flag value.
  - FIXED: The SWI-Prolog specific constraints/swipl example to not depend on the default double_quotes flag value.
  - FIXED: The SWI-Prolog specific constraints/swipl example to always load the knight object.
  - FIXED: The SWI-Prolog specific pengines example to not depend on the default double_quotes flag value.
  Tests
  - ADDED: Additional tests for the Prolog standard (=..)/2 and is/2 predicates.
  IDEs, text editors, and syntax highlighters support
  - ADDED: Support for VSCode and VSCodium code navigation features.
