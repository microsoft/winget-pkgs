ShortDescription: Declarative object-oriented logic programming language
Description: Logtalk is a declarative object-oriented logic programming language that extends and leverages the Prolog language with modern code encapsulation and code reuse mechanisms while also providing improved predicate semantics.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Logtalk compiler and runtime
  - CHANGED: The user pseudo-object to declare the before/3 and after/3 predicates multifile to avoid predicate existence errors when using this object as monitor without definitions for these predicates in user.
  - ADDED: Linter warning for predicate rules where the body is a naked meta-variable or contains a control construct where a cut-transparent argument is a naked meta-variable.
  - FIXED: The declared_in/2, defined_in/2, and redefined_from/2 predicate properties when the predicate is being declared or (re)defined in an included file.
  - FIXED: The compiler to avoid a trivial failure warning with some Prolog backends when checking the encoding_directive flag value.

  Prolog adapter and integration files
  - UPDATED: The Ciao Prolog adapter file to require version 1.22.0 or later.
  - UPDATED: All Bash shell integration scripts to also look into the /opt/homebrew/share directory (used by Homebrew on Apple Silicon) when the LOGTALKHOME environment variable is not defined.
  - UPDATED: All PowerShell integration scripts to check for and require version 7.2 or later.

  Documentation
  - ADDED: Glossary definitions for "meta-variable" and "naked meta-variable".
  - IMPROVED: Handbook section on inline formatting in info/1-2 directives comments text.
  - IMPROVED: Handbook section on documenting entities and predicates.
  - IMPROVED: Handbook section on event-driven programming.
  - FIXED: Added missing Handbook and APIs documentation sphinx_highlight.js files.

  Library
  - ADDED: Predicates read_term_from_chars/4 and read_term_from_codes/4 to the term_io library.
  - IMPROVED: The documentation of the random and types libraries.
  - FIXED: Definition of the os::time_stamp/1 library predicate for Ciao Prolog.

  Tools
  - CHANGED: The lgtdoc tool to use its own linter flag to control warnings about missing documentation directives.
  - ADDED: Linter flags to the lgtdoc tool to warn on non-standard predicate exceptions and missing periods at the end of documentation text in info/1-2 directives.
  - IMPROVED: The packs tool checking for pack version arguments by defining a custom type.
  - UPDATED: All PowerShell tool scripts to check for and require version 7.2 or later.
  - UPDATED: The lgtunit tool to print a warning on invalid (non QuickCheck) test options instead of just ignoring them.
  - UPDATED: The tutor tool to explain the new linter warning on naked meta-variables in cut-transparent control constructs.
  - IMPROVED: Simplify the lgtdoc tool generated reStructuredText files.
  - FIXED: Missing new-line after index titles in the output of the lgtdoc tool logtalk_index_to_txt.xsl XSLT file.
  - FIXED: Cases in the lgtdoc tool where looking for properties of referenced but not loaded entities could result in current_protocol/1 or protocol_property/2 exceptions.
  - FIXED: The logtalk_tester.ps1 script to report the Logtalk and backend Prolog versions as expected when using the default verbose option.
  - FIXED: Missing implementation of logtalk_tester.ps1 script -i option.

  Examples
  - UPDATED: The errors tool to illustrate the new linter warning on naked meta-variables in cut-transparent control constructs.
  - FIXED: The constraints/sicstus example linter warnings on non-terminals called as predicates.
  - FIXED: The named_databases example to only load in supported backends.

  Tests
  - CHANGED: Skip stream_property/2 tests that check eof_action/1 for output streams as they are arguably non-sensical. Thanks to Per Mildner for feedback on these tests.
  - CHANGED: Test for the meta_predicate/1 directive to accept normal argument indicators other than * (e.g. ?) as common on some Prolog systems. Thanks to Per Mildner for feedback on these tests.
  - ADDED: Tests for the syntax and semantics of the discontiguous/1 Prolog standard directive.
  - ADDED: Additional tests for the Prolog standard current_predicate/1 and callable/1 predicates.

  Ports
  - IMPROVED: Documentation of the fcube port public predicates.

  Installers and installation scripts
  - UPDATED: The manual installation script to call install-info after adding the Handbook and Logtalk APIs info files to the info directory.
  - UPDATED: The Windows installation script to also detect SICStus Prolog 4.8.x versions.
  - UPDATED: All PowerShell embedding scripts to check for and require version 7.2 or later.
