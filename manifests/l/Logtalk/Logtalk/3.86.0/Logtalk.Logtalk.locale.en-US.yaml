ShortDescription: Declarative object-oriented logic programming language
Description: Logtalk is a declarative object-oriented logic programming language that extends and leverages the Prolog language with modern code encapsulation and code reuse mechanisms while also providing improved predicate semantics.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Logtalk compiler and runtime
  - ADDED: Experimental logtalk::message_prefix_file/6 hook predicate to the message printing mechanism.
  - FIXED: False left-recursion warning when compiling a grammar rule for a multifile non-terminal that calls a local non-terminal with the same indicator.
  Prolog adapter and integration files
  - UPDATED: Ciao Prolog adapter file to pretend that modules are supported to allow loading libraries and examples that require file use_module/1 directives.
  Documentation
  - ADDED: Notes on encrypting applications using XVM.
  - FIXED: Multiple Handbook grammar and spelling typos.
  - FIXED: Multiple man pages grammar and spelling typos.
  Library
  - FIXED: The os::sleep/1 predicate for XSB to also accept floats.
  Tools
  - CHANGED: The lgtunit tool test compilation warning and error messages to include the file context for better integration with other developer tools.
  - CHANGED: The diagrams tool now uses a Unicode glyph for the magnifying lens instead of a PNG image.
  - CHANGED: The diagrams tool now uses a Graphviz box shape for Prolog modules instead of a tab, which is now only used for directories and libraries.
  - REMOVED: Deprecated lgt2svg.js script from the diagrams tool.
  - ADDED: Experimental diagrams tool support for the d2 graph language.
  - UPDATED: The diagrams tool to support graph languages such as d2 where the node identifiers are not global.
  - UPDATED: The diagrams tool to also support the PearAI, Windsurf, PyCharm, and IDEA text editors when generating diagrams with local file links.
  - UPDATED: The tutor tool to also explain duplicated predicate/non-terminal reference linter warnings.
  - UPDATED: The tutor tool to call the new logtalk::message_prefix_file/6 hook predicate to support VSCode displaying warnings and errors augmented with explanations.
  - UPDATED: The help tool for the new logtalk::message_prefix_file/6 hook predicate.
  - FIXED: The diagrams tool to also generate an instance/class caption for metaclasses.
  - FIXED: Bug in the diagrams tool where repeated nodes could be created for external entities.
  - FIXED: Bug in the diagrams tool where file loading diagrams would miss "includes" edges.
  - FIXED: Bug in the diagrams tool where file loading diagrams would show duplicated "includes" edges.
  - FIXED: The diagrams tool support for the graph languages to quote atoms in predicate labels and predicate node contents when required.
  - FIXED: The diagrams tool exclude options to allow generating external nodes for the excluded directories, files, libraries, and entities.
  - FIXED: Bug in the lgtdoc tool when printing a warning on missing entity directive info/1 key.
  Examples
  - ADDED: New permutations example providing benchmarks based on list permutations. Adapted from Prolog code written and contributed by Paul Tarau.
  - UPDATED: The assumptions example with another individual example.
  Installers and installation scripts
  Tests
  - ADDED: Additional tests for the left-recursion linter warning.
  - ADDED: Additional tests for the Prolog standard round/1 evaluable.
  - IMPROVED: The manual installation script and MacPorts Portfile instructions for defining the LOGTALKHOME and LOGTALKUSER environment variables.
  IDEs, text editors, and syntax highlighters support
  - UPDATED: VSCode support to use the new logtalk::message_prefix_file/6 hook predicate to support displaying warnings and errors augmented with the tutor tool explanations.
  - UPDATED: VSCode support to also list the lgtunit tool warning and error messages in the "PROBLEMS" pane.
  - FIXED: Compilation errors when loading the VSCode support file using the XSB backend.
