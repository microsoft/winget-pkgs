ReleaseNotes: |-
  Prolog adapter and integration files
  - REMOVED: Scryer Prolog is no longer supported due to the system refusal to implement (or accept contributions implementing) the required de facto standard version_data flag.
  - FIXED: The GNU Prolog adapter file for compatibility with versions older than 1.6.0.
  Documentation
  - IMPROVED: Simplified finding the goal to use to load an entity when browsing the APIs documentation.
  - IMPROVED: Documentation of the embedding scripts on how to handle an application using a mix of Logtalk and Prolog source files.
  - FIXED: Texinfo navigation between Handbook and APIs documentation.
  Library
  - UPDATED: The tester_versions.lgt library file to use the de facto Prolog standard version_data flag to print any additional backend Prolog version data (e.g. a git commit hash).
  Tools
  - CHANGED: The debugger tool to print a procedure box port for spy points when the port is unleashed.
  - IMPROVED: The packs tool linting of pack specifications to also check that pack versions are listed from newest to oldest.
  - UPDATED: Entity documentation generated by the lgtdoc tool now includes the goal required for loading each entity.
  - UPDATED: The tutor tool for the new linter warning on missing arithmetic functions.
  - FIXED: The packs tool linting of pack specifications would wrongly report pack dependency versions using only Major:Minor or Major.
  Examples
  - CHANGED: The document_converter example to ensure UTF-8 encoding of the text files resulting from PDF files conversion.
  - UPDATED: The errors example to illustrate linter arithmetic function warnings.
