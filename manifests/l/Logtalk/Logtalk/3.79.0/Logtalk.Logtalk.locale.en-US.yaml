ShortDescription: Declarative object-oriented logic programming language
Description: Logtalk is a declarative object-oriented logic programming language that extends and leverages the Prolog language with modern code encapsulation and code reuse mechanisms while also providing improved predicate semantics.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Logtalk compiler and runtime
  - FIXED: Regression in the logtalk_make/1 predicate check target where the file location for a missing predicate reference would not be reported correctly.
  - FIXED: Don't print left-recursion linter warnings for coinductive predicates.
  - FIXED: Allow term-expansion to generate multiple entity definitions. Thanks to Alex Kouznetsov for the bug report.
  Documentation
  - IMPROVED: Handbook documentation of the term-expansion mechanism.
  Library
  - FIXED: Silence harmless left-recursion linter warning in the timeout library tests.
  Tools
  - CHANGED: The dead_code_scanner and lgtdoc tools to print warnings using the same format used by the compiler.
  - FIXED: The code_metrics tool computation of entity cyclomatic complexity to also consider multifile predicate definitions contributed by the entity to other entities when computing graph connected components.
  - FIXED: The code_metrics tool computation of entity Unique Predicate Nodes (UPN) to also count multifile predicate definitions contributed by the entity to other entities.
  - FIXED: Code coverage for tests of the Halstead complexity metric.
  - FIXED: Deleted dead code in the code_metrics and lgtdoc tools.
  - FIXED: The wrapper reporting of missing meta_predicate/1 directives. Thanks to Alex Kouznetsov for the bug report.
  Examples
  - FIXED: Silence harmless left-recursion linter warning in the tbbt example.
  - FIXED: Missing predicates in the relations example.
  IDEs, text editors, and syntax highlighters support
  - ADDED: VSCode support predicates for using the dead_code_scanner, make, and code_metrics tools and for recursively generating documentation and diagrams.
  - UPDATED: VSCode support predicates for running tests and doclets to add compiler warnings and errors to the "Problems" pane.
  - UPDATED: VSCode support predicates for running tests the VSCode to make the tests results available for code lens.
  - UPDATED: VSCode support predicate that finds the parent file of a loaded file to also work for included files.
  - FIXED: Avoid missing entity warnings when loading the VSCode support.
