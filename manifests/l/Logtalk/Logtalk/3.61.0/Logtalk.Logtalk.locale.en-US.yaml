ReleaseNotes: |-
  Prolog adapter and integration files
  - ADDED: PowerShell integration script for Trealla Prolog. Experimental.
  - UPDATED: The Trealla Prolog adapter file to require version 2.6.3 or later.
  - UPDATED: The GNU Prolog adapter file to set the Logtalk report flag to warnings when the --quiet command-line option is used by checking the new show_information flag introduced in version 1.5.1.
  - FIXED: The YAP adapter file to set the Logtalk report flag to warnings when the -q command-line option is used.
  - FIXED: The CxProlog adapter file to set the Logtalk report flag to warnings when the --quiet command-line option is used.

  Library
  - ADDED: New ids library for generating identifiers (Base64 encoded) with parametrizable text representation and number of bytes of randomness.
  - ADDED: New pairs library object key/2 and value/3 predicates. Also add tests for all the pairs library object predicates.
  - ADDED: Additional tests for the reader library line_to_chars/2 and line_to_codes/2 predicates.

  Tools
  - ADDED: Support for using git archive for installing packs to the packs tool. This simplifies pack installation and thus improves user experience when the packs registry server uses Single Sign-On (SSO) for authentication.
  - UPDATED: The packs::describe/1 predicate to also print the pack archive URL.

  Ports
  - FIXED: The metagol port examples loader to exclude loading the sorter example when using LVM as it doesn't provide the required setarg/3 built-in predicate.

  Tests
  - ADDED: Additional tests for the standard mod/2 and rem/2 arithmetic functions.
