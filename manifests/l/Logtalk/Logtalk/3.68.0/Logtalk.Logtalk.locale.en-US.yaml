ShortDescription: Declarative object-oriented logic programming language
Description: Logtalk is a declarative object-oriented logic programming language that extends and leverages the Prolog language with modern code encapsulation and code reuse mechanisms while also providing improved predicate semantics.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Logtalk compiler and runtime
  - ADDED: New logtalk_load_context/2 predicate entity_relation key to access the entity (being compiled) relations from its opening directive. After a suggestion and prototype code from Yurii Rashkovskii.
  - FIXED: Harmless singleton variable warnings in the logtalk built-in object when using some embedding scripts.
  Prolog adapter and integration files
  - UPDATED: GNU Prolog adapter file for the format/2-3 predicate changes in version 1.6.0.
  - UPDATED: The LVM adapter file to require version 6.3.0 or later.
  - FIXED: Workaround a LVM embedding application issue with loading of plug-in shared libraries.
  Library
  - ADDED: LVM support to the library parallel_logtalk_processes_setup.pl file.
  Tools
  - ADDED: Support to the logtalk_doclet.* scripts for using a GNU Prolog executable that includes Logtalk for better performance. With the help of Daniel Diaz.
  - IMPROVED: The lgtunit tool now prints all test execution times with nine decimal digits to simplify comparing test runs. Thanks to Daniel Diaz for the suggestion.
  - IMPROVED: The packs tool installed/0-1 and outdated/0-1 predicates to list packs in alphabetical order.
  - IMPROVED: The packs tool update/0 predicate to inform when a pack is orphaned.
  - IMPROVED: The packs tool update/1-3 predicates to print an error message when a pack is orphaned.
  - IMPROVED: When using the packs tool to install a pack using git archive, delete any empty archive file created when the remote connection fails.
  - IMPROVED: When using the packs tool to install a pack using curl, fail on HTTP server errors instead of creating an archive file with the HTTP error.
  - IMPROVED: The packs tool now reports the pack or registry download full command in case of failure instead of the URL or the asset path.
  - FIXED: Bug in the packs tool where installing a pack when its archive was previously downloaded using git archive would result in a mangled directory structure.
  - FIXED: Bug in the packs tool where installing a pack would fail when updating installed dependencies was required.
  Examples
  - IMPROVED: Simplify the Java example scripts that set the required CLASSPATH environment variable.
  - UPDATED: Notes of the tabling object on current limitations.
  - UPDATED: The errors example to illustrate errors occurring in the first source file line (mainly to test IDEs and text editors support).
  Tests
  - ADDED: Tests for the call_nth/2 predicate found on increasing number of Prolog systems.
  - ADDED: Additional tests for Prolog standard syntax for terms adapted from WG17 work.
  - ADDED: Additional tests for the Prolog standard asserta/1, assertz/1, bagof/3, copy_term/2, msort/2, setof/3, sort/2, and term_variables/2 predicates adapted from WG17 work.
  - ADDED: Additional tests for the Prolog standard write_term/2 predicate.
  - FIXED: Enable running the evaluable_property/2 predicate tests when using SWI-Prolog as the backend.
  Installers and installation scripts
  - CHANGED: The SWI-Prolog based Docker image to use swipl:stable instead of swipl:latest.
  - CHANGED: All embedding scripts to patch the backend adapter files to change the settings_file flag value from allow to deny when also embedding a setting file. This prevents the generated files to to try to load (another) setting file when loaded.
  - ADDED: LVM embedding scripts support for copying all plug-in foreign library files used by an application and generate an auxiliary loader.pl file.
  - ADDED: SWI-Prolog embedding scripts support for specifying the foreign object action when building standalone saved states. Contributed by Yurii Rashkovskii.
  - UPDATED: All embedding scripts to use expand_library_alias_paths(loader) instead of the deprecated loader file.
