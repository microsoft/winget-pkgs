ShortDescription: Declarative object-oriented logic programming language
Description: Logtalk is a declarative object-oriented logic programming language that extends and leverages the Prolog language with modern code encapsulation and code reuse mechanisms while also providing improved predicate semantics.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Logtalk compiler and runtime
  - CHANGED: The message delegation control construct, []/1, to preserve also the original meta-call context.
  - ADDED: Support for runtime constructed (^^)/2 goals. Thanks to Alex Kouznetsov for the bug report.
  - ADDED: Support for using the (<<)/2 and catch/3 control constructs in a grammar rule body.
  - IMPROVED: Linter warning for calls to the {}/1 control construct.
  - FIXED: Consistent handling of meta-arguments when a meta-predicate calls another local meta-predicate with meta-arguments that are not meta-arguments of the caller.
  - FIXED: Cases where the meta-argument of phrase//1 and phrase/2-3 goals would not be called in the meta-call context. Thanks to Alex Kouznetsov for the bug report.
  - FIXED: Clean the dynamic lookup caches when changing the values of the debug and optimize flags. Thanks to Alex Kouznetsov for the bug report.
  - FIXED: Detect and report as a compiler error calls to the context(Context) built-in method from clauses with heads containing the Context variable.
  - FIXED: Calls to the clause/3 built-in method when the clause reference is bound and the clause is compiled in debug mode.
  Prolog adapter and integration files
  - CHANGED: Account for the renaming of the LVM backend to XVM.
  Documentation
  - ADDED: Notes on backend support for clause references to the adapters/NOTES.md file.
  - ADDED: Handbook documentation on using predicate aliases in uses/2 directives to use a different order of the predicate arguments.
  - ADDED: Handbook mention on the backend dependent support for clause reference built-in methods.
  - ADDED: Handbook glossary entry for "clause reference".
  - IMPROVED: Handbook documentation on meta-predicate semantics.
  - IMPROVED: Handbook documentation on the meta_predicate/1 directive.
  - IMPROVED: Handbook documentation of the (::)/2, (::)/1, (<<)/2 control constructs.
  - IMPROVED: Handbook documentation on the this/1 built-in method.
  - IMPROVED: Documentation of the lgtunit tool on how to use the assertion/1-2 utility predicates.
  - UPDATED: Handbook documentation on debugging using conditional breakpoints and log points.
  Library
  - IMPROVED: Performance of the json library when parsing large files. Thanks to Yurii Rashkovskii for the bug report.
  - IMPROVED: Performance of the meta_compiler library when generating auxiliary functors with backends that provide the atomic_list_concat/2 predicate.
  - FIXED: Error in the meta_compiler library when expanding a meta-argument that is a call to a Prolog module predicate. Thanks to Alex Kouznetsov for the bug report.
  - FIXED: Harmless linter warning when loading the types library using XSB.
  Tools
  - CHANGED: The lgtunit object test/3 private predicate is no longer declared as a meta-predicate.
  - ADDED: Support for conditional and triggered breakpoints to the debugger tool.
  - IMPROVED: The debugger tool implementation of log points to support printing the default port message, the default port message followed by a comment, and replacing the default port message with a text with term placeholders that are expanded at runtime.
  - IMPROVED: The debugger tool performance when checking for leashed ports.
  - UPDATED: Documentation on developer tools requirements.
  - UPDATED: The lgtunit tool to print a new line after reporting a failed test to simplify parsing by other tools.
  - FIXED: Removed non-required meta_predicate/1 directives for some auxiliary lgtunit object predicates.
  - FIXED: Bug in the lgtdoc tool where invalid reStructuredText files could be generated when entities are defined in source file at the root level of the documented project.
  Examples
  - ADDED: New self_vs_super example illustrating the semantics of calling an inherited meta-predicate using a message to "self" versus using a "super" call.
  - FIXED: The neo4j example finding of the Neo4j installation directory.
  - FIXED: The emetas example definition of the best_of/3 meta-predicate.
  Tests
  - ADDED: Additional tests for the (^^)/2 control construct.
  Installers and installation scripts
  - ADDED: Docker file for building an image with Logtalk, a subset of the supported Prolog backends, Jupyter, JupyterLab, and the Logtalk kernel.
  - FIXED: The SWI-Prolog based Docker image to also define the INFOPATH environment variable.
  - FIXED: The install.sh manual installation script to avoid install-info warnings and delete any old Logtalk info files.
  IDEs, text editors, and syntax highlighters support
  - REMOVED: Outdated VSCode support file vscode_message_streamer.lgt.
  - UPDATED: VSCode support to support setting conditional breakpoints.
  - UPDATED: VSCode support to add failed tests to the "Problems" pane.
  - UPDATED: VSCode support to ensure the debugger tool is loaded when calling the "Make - Debug" command.
  - FIXED: VSCode support to workaround SICStus Prolog and SWI-Prolog down-casing file paths on Windows and breaking handling of breakpoints.
