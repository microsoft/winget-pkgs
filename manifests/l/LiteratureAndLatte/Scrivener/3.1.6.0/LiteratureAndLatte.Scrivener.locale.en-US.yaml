ShortDescription: Typewriter. Ring-binder. Scrapbook. Scrivener combines all the tools you need to craft your first draft, from nascent notion to final full stop.
Description: Scrivener is the go-to app for writers of all kinds, used every day by best-selling novelists, screenwriters, non-fiction writers, students, academics, lawyers, journalists, translators and more. Scrivener won’t tell you how to write—it simply provides everything you need to start writing and keep writing.

  Refinements and Changes
  Compile
  - The compiler now suggests a file name when choosing where to save, and will persistently remember the last file name you used, per project.
  - The “MMD OpenOffice Document” compile format, for compiling ODT and FODT files via MultiMarkdown, is now capable of creating an index with grouped, or hierarchical, terms. Refer to the user manual Appendix D5.6 for details.
  - Duplicate images will no longer export multiple times when compiling to Markdown or plain-text.
  Outlining
  - Refined the outline selection behaviour so that right-clicking an item in the binder, outliner, or corkboard will open the context menu without also loading the item in the linked editor.
  - The UpArrow and DownArrow keys will now navigate the results list when focus is in the project search field, and Tab will move focus to the results.
  - Modifying an item’s custom icon and converting between folder and file types no longer update the item’s modified date.
  - Using Documents ▸ Change Icon ▸ Icon from Text…, it is now possible to create empty icons (type in a space).
  Text Editing
  - Improved the text selection behaviour in Scrivenings so that switching document focus clears previous selections that would otherwise appear active but be unresponsive.
  - Improvements to display of inline annotations, particularly across lines.
  - Inline annotations can now have their colour changed by using the text colour tool with the cursor anywhere within it, rather than having to fully select it.
  - Styles can now be toggled on and off, conforming to standard behaviour in most word processors.
  - Spelling suggestions now exclude words with characters unsupported by the dictionary’s encoding (which would use incorrect substitutes if selected).
  - Words learned with an initial lowercase letter will also be recognized when written with an initial capital.
  Minor Improvements
  - Moved the Automatic Quit setting to its own tab in Options:General.
  - Updated the Short Story project template with minor text changes.
  Bug Fixes
  - Fixed a crash that could be caused by typing a wiki-style link in RTF Scratchpad notes when Automatically detect [[document links]] was enabled.
  - Fixed a crash caused by using a custom text-based icon that consisted of whitespace characters only.
  - Fixed a bug whereby stray spaces at the end of a folder or file group name might not be removed on export, creating an invalid Windows directory that could not be deleted or renamed in File Explorer.
  - Fixed the Jump to Selection command not working in Scrivenings mode.
  - Fixed a bug that temporarily removed the editor margins after rolling back a snapshot, causing text to go directly to the edges of the editor.
  - Fixed a bug whereby toggling Show Invisibles in a Scrivenings session caused the text to scroll to the vertical middle or to the lowest scrolled position.
  - Fixed a bug whereby the Page View keyboard shortcut was not disabled in Scrivenings mode, where the command is not available.
  - Fixed a bug whereby copying and pasting text with a 6.00inch right-indent would change the indent to 0 in the pasted text.
  - Updated the look-up link for Edit ▸ Writing Tools ▸ Look Up in Dictionary.com.
  - Fixed a bug whereby newlines were not reliably discovered when using Find Next and Find Previous.
  - Fixed a bug whereby creating a new document from the text editor positioned the new item based on the binder selection rather than the editor’s focus.
  - Fixed the display of text attributes when selecting text right to left, which previously showed formatting of the text just left of the selection.
  - Fixed the highlight search in Find by Formatting, which previously might skip instances or fail when searching for a specific colour.
