ShortDescription: Get your thoughts, musings and 3am brainwaves onto the page. Then join them up in any way you like.
Description: Scapple is an easy-to-use tool for getting ideas down as quickly as possible and making connections between them. Itâ€™s the software equivalent of taking a large piece of paper and writing your thoughts and ideas all over it, in no particular order, perhaps clustering related notes and drawing lines and arrows between them as connections become apparent.
