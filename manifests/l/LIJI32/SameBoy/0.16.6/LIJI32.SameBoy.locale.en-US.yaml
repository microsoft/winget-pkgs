ReleaseNotes: |-
  This version is backwards compatible with save states from SameBoy 0.14.3 and newer, as well as save states from any BESS compliant emulator.New/Improved Features
  - You can now browse Homebrew Hub and download submitted games and demos directly in the iOS frontend.
      - Currently, only open-source submissions can be viewed in-app. The ability to allow other submissions to appear in SameBoy will be added to Homebrew Hub soon.
  - The option to open SameBoy's Library in the Files app has been added to the iOS frontend's Library screen.
  - Screen dimming is now disabled while emulation is running in the iOS frontend.
  - Improved D-pad controls in the iOS frontend â€“ the center point of the D-pad is now a safe "rest" zone; dragging a touch outside of the D-pad no longer releases the button.
  - User-provided boot ROMs can now be selected in the iOS frontend.
  Accuracy Improvements
  - Accuracy improvements to the square "zombie stepping" glitch in CGB-D and CGB-E, fixed Telefang title audio that was broken for these revisions.
  - Writing to NRx3 and NRx4 in the same cycle these registers are read by the APU is now emulated correctly.
  - SameBoy will now select cgbE_boot.bin, if available, when emulating CGB-E.
  Bug Fixes
  - Fixed a bug that triggered occasional audio distortions on some Macs and iOS devices.
  - Fixed a bug that made the iOS version sometimes incorrectly prefer SGB over CGB emulation for some newly imported ROMs.
  - Fixed a bug that could crash SameBoy upon pausing in the iOS and Cocoa frontends.
  - Fixed a bug that made the Cocoa frontend's Debug Console windows always on top.
  - Fixed a 0.16.5 regression that broke the Cocoa frontend's Memory window on macOS Sonoma.
  - Fixed stability issues when emulating the Game Boy Camera in the iOS frontend.
  - Fixed a bug that caused haptics and rumble to temporarily stop working in the iOS frontend.
  Misc Internal Changes
  - Internal support for AGB-0's boot ROM was added to the core's API (AGB-0 remains unsupported as an emulated revision for now)
