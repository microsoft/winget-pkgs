ReleaseNotes: |-
  This version is backwards compatible with save states from SameBoy 0.14.3 and newer, as well as save states from any BESS compliant emulator
  New/Improved Features
  - UI improvements to the Cocoa palette editor
  - Improved audio quality on libretro; audio is now rendered by SameBoy at 2MHz, and downsampling is now handled by the libretro frontend itself
    - In the Wii U build, downsampling is still done by SameBoy
  - With the meaning of register $FF75 discovered, it is now referred to as rPGB in the debugger
  - The output of the watchpoint debugger command now includes the watchpoint type (read-only, write-only, or read-write)
    - This makes the default watchpoint type (write-only) more obvious
  - Windows 11 users can now optionally disable rounded corners in the Graphics Options menu
  - Official Windows builds no longer require installing MSVC runtimes by linking against mvscrt.dll
  - Major improvements to debugging in the SDL frontend:
    - The main emulator window is no longer unresponsive when the debugger is stopped
    - Pressing keys in the emulator window while the debugger is paused now triggers a terminal bell
    - On Windows, sameboy.exe and sameboy_debugger.exe have been merged. Press Ctrl+C at any time to interrupt the debugger and open the debugger console, and close the console window at any time to resume normal gameplay.
    - Async debugging now supports all compatible versions of Windows, adding support for Windows 7, 8.x, and earlier builds of Windows 10
  - When using an external controller, joysticks can now optionally be used as faux analog controls
    - This feature quickly alternates D-pad buttons between pressed and release states to simulate analog inputs
  - The SDL frontend will now automatically resize the window when switching between models and border modes as long as the window hasn't been manually resized
  - A workaround for an old RetroArch bug has been removed, audio in the Wii U libretro port is now louder
  - It is now possible to enable audio for both Game Boys in the Link Cable mode of the libretro port
  Accuracy Improvements/Fixes
  - OAM randomization is now more accurate
  - Fixed a bug where certain SGB transfers would copy data incorrectly when running SameBoy on big endian platforms
    - This fixes many SGB games suffering from garbled graphics when playing on the Wii U
  - Fixed a potential accuracy issue when emulating MBC7 games
  - The number of band-limited phases was increased in order to reduce overtones in high-pitched sounds
  Bug Fixes
  - New palettes will now appear on the Cocoa frontend even if the user have previously customized palettes
  - Fixed a bug that caused the Pink Pop theme to modify itself once opened in the palette editor, in both the Cocoa and iOS frontends
  - Fixed a bug where the vertical layout was not usable on certain iPads
  - Resetting emulation in the SDL version while the emulator is paused will now resume emulation
  - Fixed a bug where changing the emulated model in the SDL frontend does not immediately closes the menu
  - Removed Unicode characters from libretro settings, as many frontends cannot display them
  - Fixed a bug that caused ROMs to run without a window in the Cocoa port after changing the emulated revision
  - Several iOS and watchOS crashes have been fixed
  Removed Features
  - Integration with the Homebrew Hub has been removed from the iOS frontend
  Misc Internal Changes
  - The OpenDesktop thumbnailer is now stripped when built in release configuration, rather than being stripped only upon installation
  - Official releases of SameBoy now build using the latest version of Clang, gaining speed boost of around 8%
  - The FM synthesis routines used while rendering the SGB jingle have been optimized for speed
