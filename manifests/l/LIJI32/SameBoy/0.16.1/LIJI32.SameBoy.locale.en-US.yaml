ReleaseNotes: |-
  New/Improved Features
  - SameBoy on iOS will now warn the user if it hasn't been correctly signed, which could prevent "Open With" from working with SameBoy
  Accuracy Improvements/Fixes

  Bug Fixes
  - Fixed a bug that made SameBoy incompatible with macOS versions 10.9 to 10.15
  - Fixed several UI issues with the Printer Feed on macOS Big Sur and newer
  - Prevent some Cocoa toolbar items from overflowing into a menu item that would crash on click
  - Fixed a bug that prevented SameBoy from opening ROM files if VisualBoyAdvance was also installed on macOS
  - VSync is now automatically disabled in the SDL frontend if the screen refresh rate is under 60Hz, which could cause garbled audio on some machines
  - Fixed a bug where the SDL frontend would indefinitely hang if the current audio device became unavailable while using the XAudio 2.7 driver
  Misc Internal Changes
  - The iOS Deb releases no longer contain local file ownership information
  - The SDL version used in the Windows release has been updated to 2.28.5
