ReleaseNotes: |-
  Accuracy Improvements/Fixes
  - Improvements to the "Accurate" frame blending option; SameBoy now correctly tracks the "parity" of each frame, and uses a more realistic blending ratio
  - Support for bootleg ROMs that claim to have no RAM in the MBC field, but also declare a non-zero RAM size
  Bug Fixes
  - Removed XAudio 2.7 support and replaced it with the redistributable version of XAudio 2.9, fixing various crashes on Windows 7
  - Fixed an issue with the menu graphics being glitches in the SDL frontend if SameBoy is set to display a border
  - Fixed the update dialog in the Cocoa frontend displaying the changelog in the wrong font on versions of macOS
  - Fixed Quick Look support being broken on macOS Sonoma
  - Fixed a bug where the Cocoa and iOS frontend would sometimes flicker when using the Metal renderer
