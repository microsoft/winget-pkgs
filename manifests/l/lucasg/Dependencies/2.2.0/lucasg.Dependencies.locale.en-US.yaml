Description: |-
  Dependencies is a rewrite of the legacy software Dependency Walker which was shipped along Windows SDKs, but whose development stopped around 2006. Dependencies can help Windows developers troubleshooting their dll load dependencies issues.

  Dependencies currently does not recursively resolve child imports when parsing a new PE since it can be really memory-hungry to do so ( it can over a GB even for "simple" PEs ). This behavior can be overridden (app-wide) via a property located in "Options->Properties->Tree build behaviour".Dependencies currently does not recursively resolve child imports when parsing a new PE since it can be really memory-hungry to do so ( it can over a GB even for "simple" PEs ). This behavior can be overridden (app-wide) via a property located in "Options->Properties->Tree build behaviour".

  Tree build behaviours available :
  - ChildOnly (default): only process PE child imports and nothing beyond.
  - RecursiveOnlyOnDirectImports: do not process delayload dlls.
  - Recursive: Full recursive analysis. You better have time and RAM on your hands if you activate this setting
ReleaseNotes: |-
  - - Fixed Issue [#272](lucasg#272). When showing the Import list, missing imports will be shown at the top.
    - Fixed Issue [#285](lucasg#285) Copying dll files from the dependencies GUI.
    - Improved resolving dependancies for CLR dlls that use mono cecil
    - Fixed issues with CI system that came up after upgrading to VS2022. Thank you xiaoweiChen for the code change which I used as a reference.
