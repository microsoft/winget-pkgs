  🩹 Hotfix v2.1.28

  Created by hotfix script
  Summary by Sourcery
  Introduce a dedicated hotfix workflow that automates creating hotfix branches, PRs, version bumps, and GitHub releases while aligning auto-tag and release processes with these hotfix semantics.
  New Features:
  - Add a hotfix workflow script and npm command to generate hotfix branches, push them, and open PRs against main with standardized titles and bodies.
  - Extend the auto-tag workflow to detect hotfix PRs by branch naming, compute patch versions, update package.json, and create hotfix-specific tags and GitHub releases.
  Enhancements:
  - Simplify settings content staticization by always including business tab components instead of gating them by an environment flag.
  - Adjust the release workflow to validate package.json version against the tag instead of mutating it during release, and update the release branch creation script to stop creating marker commits.
  - Update dependency on @lobehub/ui to the latest minor version.
  Build:
  - Add a package.json script entry to run the new hotfix workflow CLI.
  CI:
  - Enhance the auto-tag GitHub Actions workflow to share tagging context via environment variables, tag the version-bump commit instead of the PR merge commit, and tailor release notes and tag messages for release vs hotfix PRs.
