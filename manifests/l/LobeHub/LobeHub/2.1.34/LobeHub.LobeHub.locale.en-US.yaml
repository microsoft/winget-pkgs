  📝 Additional Information
  Summary by Sourcery
  Scope agent evaluation benchmarks and new bot provider bindings by user while introducing infrastructure for external chat platform integrations.
  New Features:
  - Add agent bot provider database schema and model to store per-agent external platform bindings with encrypted credentials.
  - Introduce agent agency configuration types and persist agencyConfig on agents for Discord and Slack bot settings.
  Bug Fixes:
  - Associate agent evaluation benchmarks with a userId and restrict create, query, update, delete, and lookup operations to the owning user while still allowing access to system benchmarks.
  Enhancements:
  - Export new agentBotProvider schema and agency configuration types through existing database and type index barrels.
  Tests:
  - Extend agent evaluation benchmark model tests to cover user-scoped behavior, including isolation between different users and handling of system benchmarks.
