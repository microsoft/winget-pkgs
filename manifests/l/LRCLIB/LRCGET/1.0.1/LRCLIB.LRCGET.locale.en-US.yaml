ReleaseNotes: |-
  Changelog:
  - Updated Cargo dependencies to prepare for the upcoming Flatpak version (#254 by @guihkx)
  - Fixed crashes when no audio output device is available (resolves #157)
  Screenshot:Note:
  - For now, this fix only prevents the crash and shows a notification to the user. There is currently no automatic recheck logic, so audio playback will not work again until the application is restarted.
  If you're here before version 1.0.0, check out the v1.0.0 changelog to learn more about all the new features!
