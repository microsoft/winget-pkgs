ReleaseNotes: |-
  - [[Breaking Changes]]
    - Make sure all Logseq clients on your devices are upgraded to 0.8.9 or above when you are going to apply the new filename format (:triple-lowbar).
    - Newly created graphs on Logseq 0.8.9 or above are also using the new filename format by default. May restore the legacy format to keep compatible with old Logseq versions.
    - Opening graphs in new filename format with earlier versions of Logseq will wrongly display some page titles and break some page references. AVOID creating or renaming pages on these graphs with old versions of Logseq (e.g. Logseq 0.8.2 on iOS until the upgrade is released)

    - Reproducible plugin configuration
      - This introduces a config file, plugins.edn, which is automatically updated with your installed plugins, this makes it easy to share your plugins set and try others as well.
      - How to use it?
        - a. Reload (or restart) the app to have a plugins.edn created for you
        - b. Installing, updating or removing a plugin updates plugins.edn
        - c. Try someone else's plugins a.k.a. install from plugins.edn
          - a. Back up your plugins. If you have plugins.edn, save a copy of that file. If you don't have a plugins.edn, move ~/.logseq/plugins to ~/.logseq/plugins.bak
          - b. If you want to back up your plugin preferences: move ~/.logseq/settings to ~/.logseq/settings.bak
          - c. Choose a plugins.edn you want to try - check examples below.
