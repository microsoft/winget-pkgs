ReleaseNotes: |-
  Fixed and improvements:
  Performance & Reliability Update
  This release includes multiple internal improvements and extensive testing to deliver better performance and reliability for NGINX.
  We've made targeted optimizations and thoroughly tested them to resolve reported issues and ensure stable, reliable operation.
  What's Improved
  PHP FastCGI Ports
  - Default port: 10987 (to avoid conflicts with Xdebug)
  - Fallback port: 20987
  PHP Processes Management
  - Automatically detects when PHP process counts are too low and enforces a minimum of 4
  - Configurable PHP process count
  Example (Menu > Laragon > laragon.ini):
  # (Menu > Laragon > laragon.ini) under [nginx]
  PHP_FCGI_CHILDREN=20    # number of PHP processes (default: 10)
  PHP_FCGI_MAX_REQUESTS=0 # auto-restart after N requests (default: 0 = unlimited)
  - The latest Apache v2.4.66 (VS18) is now bundled, and the fcgi module has also been updated to VS18. This upgrade brings better performance and more efficient memory management.
  - Update Nginx to the latest version 1.28.2
  - Improved [Auto Update] to ensure seamless updates to the latest PHP versions (8.5.3 and newer)
  - Fix bug: Laragon QuickApp fails with Laravel Installer
  - Fix bug: Switching profile and services
  - Fix bug: Nginx requires 2x reloads
  - Fix bug: Nginx & PHP Limit request
  - Fix bug: Port conflict with xdebug + nginx
  - Fix bug: PHP CGI not exiting on PHP version change
  - Fix bug: Laragon with Guzzle not closing http connections cleanly
  Notes:
  - Smoothly upgrade from older version of Laragon to Laragon 8:
    Please follow this guide: #1059
  - Smoothly update to the latest version of Laragon: Just download and run LaragonUpdater.exe
  Laragon supports both versions of phpMyAdmin:
  1. Menu > MySQL > phpMyAdmin: phpMyAdmin 5
  2. Menu > MySQL > phpMyAdmin6: phpMyAdmin 6 - This version works with PHP 8.4+
