ReleaseNotes: |-
  Laragon - The Dev Environment for Entrepreneurs v7.0 2025

  Note: Starting from this version, a license is required to use Laragon. This change allows me to
  prioritize support for users who contribute financially to the continued growth of Laragon.New
  features:

  - Auto backup: Laragon 2025 will auto backup data dir every 1 hour and keep 5 recent backups.
  - Profile: Laragon 2025 introduces the Profile feature, allowing you to create multiple
    environments with different versions. You can easily add and switch between environments via
    Menu > Profile

  Note: From Laragon 7.0.2, the default pretty URL is {name}.test.

  - The default pretty URL will be {name}.localhost. This eliminates the need to modify the hosts
    file in Laragon, enhancing security. This simplifies multi-tenancy development by allowing
    multiple subdomains (e.g., tenant1.app.localhost, tenant2.app.localhost, tenant3.app.localhost,
    ...) to route to the same application code of app.localhost, with each subdomain representing a
    different tenant.
  - Enhanced Tool > Path > Add Laragon to Path: When you add Laragon to the Path (so you can call
    all service inside Laragon system-wide), it will automatically update the Path whenever a
    service version or profile is changed.
