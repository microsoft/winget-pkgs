ShortDescription: A smaller version of Lenovo System Update which does not require installation
Description: Lenovo Thin Installer is a smaller version of Lenovo System Update which does not require installation - it can simply be copied to the target system. Thin Installer searches for the update packages from a repository that you create. The repository can be created on your local hard drive, a network share, a web server, or external media such as a CD, DVD, or USB hard drive. When Thin Installer finishes installing applicable packages, no registry keys relating to Thin Installer exist - thus the user only needs to delete the folder containing Thin Installer to remove all files associated with Thin Installer and the associated repository
