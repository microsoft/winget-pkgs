Description: |-
  Lenovo AI Meeting Manager is an intelligent office voice assistant for Windows PC, featuring various AI functions such as real-time voice translation, audio/video real-time subtitle translation, voice input, etc.
  - Intelligent Subtitle: In the scenarios where the audio/video voice content needs to be translated, such as meetings and multi-language communication, it can assist in translating the corresponding language to other countries and displaying it through text.
  - Meeting Editing: Organize and edit the audio files and text files from real-time translation or one-key transcription, as well as save the texts. The files generated by real-time translation can be exported to Word, Excel and TXT formats in the form of original/translation/original & translation. The record files generated by one-key transcription can only be exported as the original text.
  - Audio to Text: Extract and export the contents of audio/video files as Word or TXT documents as needed.
  - Voice Recording: Through voice input, when you are writing emails or trying to use text input across software, it can automatically transcribe/translate the user's voice into the required text information.
  - Please use this program under the network service provided by ISP (China Mobile, China Unicom, China Telecom, etc.) in mainland China.
