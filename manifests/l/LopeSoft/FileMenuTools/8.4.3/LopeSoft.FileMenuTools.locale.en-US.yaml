ShortDescription: FileMenu Tools is an application which lets you customize the context menu of Windows File Explorer
Description: |-
  FileMenu Tools is an application which lets you customize the context menu of Windows Explorer.
  The application adds built-in utilities to perform operations on files and folders and adds custom commands which let you run external applications, copy/move to a specific folder or delete specific file types.
  With FileMenu Tools, you also can customize the "Send to..." submenu, and either enable or disable context-menu commands added by other applications.

  Built-in Utilities
  - The synchronization type (unidirectional, bidirectional, etc.) and the file types to be synchronized may be specified.
  - Recursively delete specific file types from a folder. The file types may be specified with wildcards, for example: *.txt, *.t??, etc.
  - Find and replace a text string in all selected files. Regular expressions are supported.
  - Rename all selected elements according to specified rules.
  - Delete files which are locked by any application and cannot be deleted normally.
  - Delete the selected elements WITHOUT moving them to the Recycle Bin.
  - Change the icon assigned to the selected folder.
  - Run a program with parameters typed in a dialog box.
  - Open a command line window in the selected folder.
  - Display a submenu which lets you change the attributes of the selected elements. If a folder is selected, it is possible to change the attributes recursively.
  - Copy the selected elements to another folder. Filters may be specified in order to copy specific file types.
