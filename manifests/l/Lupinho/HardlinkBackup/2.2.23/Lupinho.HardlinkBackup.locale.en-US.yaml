Description: HardlinkBackup is a simple, fast incremental backup program that uses hard links, schedules backups, sends email notifications, and automatically deletes old backups. HardlinkBackup reads the source directories and compares the files with previous backups. Only the changed files will be copied afterwards, the unchanged files will be hard-linked to the files of the already existing backups (provided that the target drive supports hard links, e.g. formatted with NTFS). In this way, there is always a complete copy of the source directories from the respective date on the backup drive. However, only the space of one copy plus the modified files is required. If an old backup copy is no longer needed, it can be disposed of without any problems by simply deleting the corresponding backup directory. The idea of HardlinkBackup is the same as the rsyncbackup.vbs of the magazine c't, enhanced by a graphical user interface and many other features.
