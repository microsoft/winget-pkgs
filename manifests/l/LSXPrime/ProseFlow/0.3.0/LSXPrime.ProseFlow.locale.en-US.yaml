  ﻿# 🎉 ProseFlow v0.3.0 – Release Notes
  We are excited to launch ProseFlow v0.3.0, a landmark release that transforms how you create and use AI-powered actions. This update introduces Templated Actions with Placeholders, a powerful new Generation Mode for creating content from scratch, and a completely overhauled Actions UI with bulk-management capabilities.
  These features turn simple prompts into dynamic, reusable, and shareable tools, elevating ProseFlow from a text processor to a comprehensive AI workflow engine.

  🌟 Highlights
  1. Templated Actions with Placeholders
  Actions are no longer static prompts! You can now create dynamic, multi-step workflows by embedding placeholders (e.g., [language]) in your instructions. When you run a templated action, the floating menu guides you through a step-by-step form to fill in the details.
  - Multiple Input Types: Choose from Text, Multiline Text, Choice (dropdown), Boolean (Yes/No), Number, Date, and even a File Picker.
  - Validation Rules: Enforce required fields, set character limits, or define numeric ranges to ensure valid input.
  - Conditional Logic: Create intelligent workflows by showing or hiding subsequent steps based on user input.
  - Smart Defaults: Pre-fill values with dynamic tokens like {clipboard}, {date:yyyy-MM-dd}, and {appContext} to accelerate common tasks.
  - New Presets: Get started with powerful new templated actions, including Summarize, Translate, Rephrase, Write an Email, and Create Social Media Post.
  💡 This feature transforms simple actions into sophisticated, reusable applications for complex tasks.

  2. Generation Mode & Enhanced Custom Instructions
  ProseFlow now excels at creating content from scratch. Actions can be designated as not requiring selected text (requiresSelection: false), enabling a new Generation Mode.
  - Generate from Scratch: When no text is selected, the floating menu filters for generation-capable actions. The search bar becomes a prompt input field, allowing you to describe what you want to create.
  - Save Custom Instructions: The "Custom Instruction" feature now logs the full instruction to your history. You can save these ad-hoc prompts as new, reusable actions directly from the history view with a single click.

  3. Overhauled Actions UI with Bulk Management
  The Actions screen has been completely redesigned for power users and teams managing large sets of actions.
  - Multi-Selection: Use checkboxes to select multiple actions at once.
  - Contextual Toolbar: A new toolbar appears when items are selected, enabling bulk operations:
    - Bulk Delete: Permanently remove multiple actions.
    - Bulk Move: Move selected actions to another group in one step.
    - Bulk Export: Export only the selected actions to a JSON file.
  - Action Management: Actions can now be easily duplicated or moved up/down within their group from a new context menu.

  🛠️ Core & Infrastructure Improvements
  📄 New Document Reader Service
  A powerful new IDocumentReaderService can now extract plain text from various file types, enabling the new "File Picker" placeholder. Supported formats include:
  - .pdf
  - .docx
  - .xlsx, .xls
  - .epub
  - .txt, .md, and many other plain-text-like formats.
  🚀 Refactored Startup Logic
  The application's startup process has been decomposed into modular, single-responsibility services (DatabaseInitializer, BackgroundServiceInitializer, UiInitializer, DependencyInjectionSetup, etc.).
  - Improved Maintainability: Cleaner, more organized code makes future development easier.
  - Resilient Database Handling: A new recovery flow gracefully handles database corruption by prompting the user to back up the corrupt file and reset the application data, preventing startup failures.

  🎨 UI & UX Refinements
  ✍️ Redesigned Action Editor
  The Action Editor has been rebuilt from the ground up to support templated actions:
  - An intuitive interface for adding, configuring, and removing placeholders.
  - Dedicated sections for setting up validation rules and conditional display logic.
  - A smart token inserter for easily adding dynamic default values.
  🎓 Enhanced Onboarding
  - A new tutorial step introduces users to the power of templated actions with an interactive simulation.
  - A visual progress indicator now tracks your journey through the setup process.
  - The hotkey tutorial has been updated to better reflect the Diff View output mode.

  ❤️ Thank You
  This release is a huge step forward for ProseFlow, making it a more versatile and powerful tool for everyone.
