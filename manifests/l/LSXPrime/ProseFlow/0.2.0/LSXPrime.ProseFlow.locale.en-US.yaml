  We‚Äôre thrilled to announce ProseFlow v0.2.0, a major milestone that significantly expands the application‚Äôs capabilities with powerful new features, refined user experience, and robust infrastructure improvements. This release introduces shared workspace support, a floating action orb, diff view for safe editing, background task tracking, and much more.

  üåü Highlights
  1. Shared Workspace & Team Sync
  Collaborate seamlessly with your team! ProseFlow now supports shared workspaces‚Äîa folder (local or cloud-synced) that stores your Actions and Provider configurations.
  - Connect to a shared workspace during onboarding or via Settings.
  - Encrypt sensitive data (like API keys) using a workspace password.
  - Choose between Manual or Automatic sync modes.
  - Resolve conflicts with configurable strategies: Overwrite, Skip, or Prompt.
  üí° Ideal for teams wanting consistent AI workflows across machines.

  2. Floating Action Orb
  A persistent, draggable orb floats on your screen‚Äîoffering instant access to ProseFlow without memorizing hotkeys.
  - Click to open the Floating Action Menu.
  - Right-click for a quick context menu (Open App, Quit, Close Orb).
  - Drag & drop text onto the orb to trigger the new Arc Menu‚Äîa radial menu of your favorite or context-relevant actions.
  - Shows a live badge indicating active background tasks.
  - Fully customizable: hide it in Settings if preferred.

  3. Diff View for Safe Editing
  When using actions with Diff output mode, you‚Äôll now see a side-by-side comparison of your original and AI-generated text.
  - Accept, Refine, Regenerate, or Cancel with confidence.
  - Powered by DiffPlex with word-level highlighting for precise changes.
  - Supports inline refinement instructions for iterative improvements.
  ‚úÖ Perfect for critical edits where you need full control over AI output.

  4. Background Task Tracker
  All AI actions are now tracked in real time on the Overview Dashboard.
  - See active processes, their status (Queued/Processing), and elapsed time.
  - Cancel long-running tasks directly from the UI.
  - Visual feedback on the Floating Orb and in notifications.
