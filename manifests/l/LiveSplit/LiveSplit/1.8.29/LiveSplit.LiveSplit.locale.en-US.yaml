ReleaseNotes: |-
  * The TCP Server is now part of LiveSplit, rather than requiring a separate Server component. Some server commands behave slightly differently now, and some bugs were fixed. Server commands are documented in the LiveSplit README on GitHub.
  * Fixed sharing to Twitter. Now, it copies a screenshot of LiveSplit to the clipboard and uses a Web Intent to open a Tweet composition window in the browser.
  * Added a Comparison Time component, which shows the final time (or split time/segment time) for a particular comparison.
  * When a delta is exactly 0, the value is now shown with the "ahead" color and without a plus sign.
  * Fixed a bug with the Speedrun.com authentication prompt not redirecting to the API key page in the settings.
  * Fixed a bug with transparency in a gradient not being displayed properly when sharing to a screenshot.
  * Fixed a bug with the "and" character not being displayed properly in Autosplitter descriptions.
  * Fixed a bug where removing the game icon and then clicking the cancel button in the Splits Editor caused the Title component to disappear.
  * Fixed a bug with categories not always updating when the game name is changed in the Splits Editor.
  * Fixed a bug with downloading the box art from Twitch not working correctly.
  * Fixed a bug with the "Log Out of All Accounts" button not removing credentials in memory until the next time LiveSplit was opened.
  * Fixed a bug with some splits files with unsupported image types failing to load.
  * Fixed a bug with font sizes not being consistent before vs. after editing font settings for a layout.
  * Improved the performance of the autocomplete dropdown when choosing a game name in the Splits Editor.
  * Improved the performance of the races list in the right click menu for Racetime.gg and SpeedRunsLive.
  * The Speedrun.com games list is now cached, and is only reloaded when the Splits Editor is opened.
  * For future updates, the update prompt will no longer appear in the background, in order to prevent some potential issues with LiveSplit hanging.
  * When sharing to Excel, the auto filtering functionality was removed, because LiveSplit now uses an official version of Xlio.
  * TLS 1.2 is now enforced for downloading the Auto Splitters XML from GitHub.

  Hotkey Indicator Component:
  * The height or width can now be adjusted in the settings.

  Racetime integration:
  * Switch to WebView2 for accessing the Racetime.gg site.
  * Fixed a bug with the "Log Out of All Accounts" button in the LiveSplit Settings not affecting Racetime.gg credentials.
  * Game images for races are no longer fetched, which slightly improves LiveSplit's performance on startup.

  Video Component:
  * Fixed newer versions of VLC causing LiveSplit to crash when using the Video component.
  * Fixed a bug with height and width changes not being reflected sometimes.

  World Record Component:
  * There is now a setting to override the timing method.
