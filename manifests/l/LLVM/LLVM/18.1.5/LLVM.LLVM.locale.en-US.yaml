ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Fixed an incorrect type inference during RISC-V instruction selection, which causes an assertion failure when trying to fold selects into their operands.
  - Fixes a X86 bug introduced during LLVM18, which crashes when compiling some bit vector with AVX512.
  - Fixes a Clang assertion failure caused by emitting gap coverage mapping regions between statements with <invalid sloc>.
  - Fixed an issue with the counted_by attribute on a flexible array member in an inner struct.
  - Fix an issue in previous dot releases, with a critical slowdown on analyzing code hashing or doing many array accesses. This bug did not affect previous major releases. See the details at issue #89045.
  - Restores clang-format behavior that always breaks before a stream insertion operator (<<) when both operands are string literals.
  - Fixes clang-format regressions in annotating initialization list braces and trailing return type arrow, and breaking after the block comment before a function argument.
  - Fixed a crash in security.cert.env.InvalidPtr checker when accidentally
    matched user-defined strerror and similar library functions.
