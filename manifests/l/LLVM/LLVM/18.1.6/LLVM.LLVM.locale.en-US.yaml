ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Fixes issues where LLVM is either generating the incorrect thunk for a function with aligned parameters or didn’t correctly pass through the return value when StructRet was used.
  - -Xclang -target-feature -Xclang +unaligned-scalar-mem can be used to enable unaligned scalar memory accesses for CPUs that do not support unaligned vector accesses. -mno-strict-align will enable unaligned scalar and vector memory accesses.
  - Don’t replace an aliasee with an alias that has weak linkage. This avoids incorrect linkage that can lead to using the wrong symbols during linking time.
  - This patch fixes build failures when compiling AVX512 code using -march=native on machines without AVX512. The problem was introduced by [X86] Enable EVEX512 when host CPU has AVX512 (#90479) · llvm/llvm-project@a7b8b89 · GitHub which is included in LLVM 18.1.5 release.
  - Fixes crash in AArch64 backend when having true or false as operand for a fcmp instruction on IR level.
  - Fixes compiler crash when user specifies -mno-evex512 with AVX512 features but no AVX512VL.
  - Fixes a bug that tries to do VBROADCAST_LOAD for f16 without AVX2.
