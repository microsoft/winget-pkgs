ReleaseNotes: |-
  Important information
  This release requires Windows 10.0.20348 (May 24, 2021) or later.
  You must stay on your current Screenpresso version if you use an older version of Windows.
  Enhanced screenshot engine
  Whole new screen capture engine
  Screen captures now use the graphics card (GPU) instead of the CPU. This improves performance and reduces memory usage. After extensive testings, we believe Screenpresso now offers of the best capture engine for Windows.
  Window capture
  If you click a window (instead of drawing a rectangle), Screenpresso captures it exactly as it is displayed on the screen. If the window has a custom shape (for example, round), Screenpresso saves a rectangle with transparent corners. This keeps the result clean when you paste it into an email or document.
  A round window example as it appears on the desktop:

  Support for HDR screens
  When HDR is enabled, screenshots could look too bright. This is now fixed. This improvement works for both screenshots and video recordings.

  HDR now:

  Capture autoscroll
  Improved the image stitching engine. Capturing a scrolling window works better and faster.
  Magnifier
  The magnifier shown during capture is larger and easier to use. You can also use the arrow keys to move the mouse more slowly for precise selection.
  Hide desktop icon
  You can now hide all desktop icons automatically during capture for cleaner results.
  You can also still change the desktop wallpaper during capture from the settings.

  Automatic blur (pro)
  Via settings you can enable automatic detection and blur for sensitive content. This includes emails, credit cards, IP addresses, and API keys. This feature is available for PRO users in both screenshots and real-time video recording. Later, in the built-in image editor, you can choose which blurred sections to remove.

  Removed Tesseract OCR
  We removed the third-party Tesseract OCR integration because some of its components were often reported as insecure. Screenpresso now uses only the built-in Windows' OCR.
  Enhanced video capture engine
  Whole new video capture engine
  Video capture now uses the graphics card (GPU) instead of the CPU. This improves performance and reduces memory usage. Screenpresso now supports 4K video at 60 FPS in high quality (PRO). In settings, you can choose low quality for smaller files or high quality for better visuals.

  By the way, Screenpresso is the only tool supporting GPU-based recording across multiple screens at the same time.
  Added support for HEVC (pro)
  You can now record video with the HEVC codec. HEVC can create smaller MP4 files with better quality, but it may be less compatible on some computers. It is disabled by default and can be enabled in settings.
  Speech to text (pro)
  You can now generate subtitles automatically from your voice while recording. After enabling this in Screenpresso settings and Windows privacy settings, Screenpresso listens only during recording to create text. Subtitles are saved as a .srt file next to your .mp4 file. You can edit the .srt file later with a text editor such as Notepad. You can share the MP4 and SRT as separate files, or merge subtitles into the MP4 with the built-in video editor. After merge, subtitles can no longer be edited.
  Noise gate (pro)
  Microphone recording quality is now 48000Hz mono, and audio loopback (speaker output) is now stereo. We also added a basic noise gate to reduce microphone background noise. We also increased the number of supported microphone types.
  Mirrored Webcam
  The webcam view is now mirrored. If you move your head to the right, it moves right in the preview/video.
  New Webcam's shape
  We replaced the old ellipse shape with a vertical rounded shape. The webcam rendering also now uses a new GPU-based engine.
  Other changes
  We removed AVI recording support and updated FFmpeg to version 8.0.
  Artificial Intelligence (pro)
  Screenpresso now includes Google Gemini AI.
  In the built-in image editor, you can ask AI to modify your screenshot.

  For IT admins, Screenpresso already supports policies. You can completly disable this new feature using the "NoAI" key.
  Sharing changes
  Reworked Dropbox and Linear sharing features
  Previously, authorization tokens expired quickly. Now tokens stay valid until you revoke access from your cloud provider account settings.
  Fixed network proxy issue
  On some company computers, Screenpresso could not access the internet because of proxy settings. This issue is now fixed.
  Removed built-in support for Evernote and Twitter
  Updated AWS SDK, Google SDK, and SSH libraries to the latest versions
  Workspace changes
  Fixed multiple selection issue
  Example: if you selected image 2, held Shift, then clicked image 6, all images were selected. Now Screenpresso correctly selects only images 2 to 6.
  Thumbnail during drag and drop
  When you drag an image from the workspace to another app (for example Windows File Explorer or Google Chrome), a real thumbnail is shown instead of a generic icon. This improves visual feedback.
  Fixed app crash
  When a laptop went to sleep, Screenpresso could enter an unstable state after wake-up. If save dialogs were open and the user clicked Cancel, the app could crash later. This scenario is now detected. Screenpresso saves changes and restarts itself safely when needed.
  Privacy
  We continue to improve security and privacy in Screenpresso. Screenpresso is now compliant with Windows privacy best practices. The app now uses newer Windows APIs that require feature-by-feature permissions. Windows may ask you to allow screen capture, file access, microphone access, webcam access, and more.
  For IT admins, Screenpresso already supports policies. You can disable unwanted features through the Windows Registry. See the user manual for details (press F1 in Screenpresso).
