  Release Notes
  Improved Game Detection
  - Multi-Mode Detection: Added configurable detection modes: Auto (all methods), Discrete GPU Only, Known Game List, and Windows Game Mode.
  - dGPU Usage Tracking: Games are now detected based on dedicated GPU utilization, catching titles that other detection methods might miss.
  - Dynamic Mode Switching: Detection modes can now be switched on-the-fly without restarting the application. State is preserved across mode changes.
  - Catch-Up Logic: When switching detection modes, already-running games are immediately recognized by the new mode.
  - Permission Hardening: Games running as Administrator are now detected even when LLT cannot read their full executable path.
  - Startup Stability: AI Controller initialization is now prioritized to ensure consistent system state before Automation triggers.
  Automation Enhancements
  - Run on Startup Option: Pipelines can now be marked to automatically check and apply when the application starts.
  - Dangerous Step Protection: Steps that could cause issues on startup (Close App, Deactivate GPU, Hybrid Mode, Turn Off WiFi, Turn Off Monitors) are automatically skipped during startup execution.
  - Step Priority Warnings: Added UI warnings for conflicting automation steps (e.g., brightness changes overridden by power mode transitions OR adding a dangerous step).
  - Search and Filter: Added search/filter functionality to automation step and pipeline creation windows.
  - Startup Trigger Handling: Improved automation pipeline triggers to handle StartupAutomationEvent correctly.
  - OR Trigger Logic: Added support for OR conditions in automation pipeline triggers, allowing pipelines to run when any of multiple conditions are met.
  - Drag and Drop Reordering: Implemented drag-and-drop functionality for reordering automation steps and actions within pipelines.
  - Fan Max Speed Step: Added new automation step to control maximum fan speed settings.
  User Configuration
  - Process Blacklist: Implemented a user-configurable process exclusion list for game detection.
  - Detection Mode UI: Added a Game Detection card on the Automation page with a dropdown for mode selection and an "Excluded Processes" button for managing the process blacklist.
  - Settings Page Redesign: Redesigned the settings page, organizing individual settings into appropriate categories.
  Bug Fixes
  - Tray Tooltip Freeze Fix: Prevented UI thread blocking when hovering over the tray icon immediately after startup by implementing async factory pattern for StatusWindow.
  - State Transition Fix: Ensured "Game Stopped" events fire correctly when switching between detection modes.
  - Drag Handler Rewrite: Replaced and improved drag handlers to resolve inconsistent behavior and improve responsiveness.
  - Game Focus Handling: Fixed the Game Stop trigger firing incorrectly when a game loses focus.
  - Hybrid-Auto Battery Fix: Fixed an issue where, when using Hybrid-Auto, the dGPU wouldn't eject after a cold boot or restart while on battery.
  - GPUController Exception Refactor: Refactored exception handling in GPUController to use NVIDIAApiException for specific error codes, including improved NVAPI error handling.
  - dGPU Log Spam Fix: Fixed an issue where logs would spam after the dGPU was ejected.
  - dGPU P-State Persistence Fix: Fixed an issue that caused the dGPU to remain permanently in the P0/P8 states.
  - dGPU Minimized Wake Fix: Fixed an issue where the dGPU would wake up repeatedly when the application was minimized.
  - Autorun Task XML Fix: Fixed an issue where Task XML contains unexpected nodes in Autorun configuration.
  - Sensors Control NaN Fix: Fixed NaN is not a valid value for property Value in SensorsControlV2.
  - CCD Visibility Fix: Fixed an issue that prevents the CCD from being hidden if no active cores are present..
  - Windows 23H2 Crash Fix: Fixed an issue where Windows versions older than 23H2 would cause silent crash. Added Extreme mode to HasGodModeToOtherModeSwitchingBug.
  - Legacy Laptop Fixes: Fixed issues on legacy laptops where Dynamic Boost and GPU CTGP are affected by Max Offset. Fixed NotificationWindow showing in Taskbar. Fixed Advanced Overclocking option being available for Intel laptops.
  - Chinese Model Processing: Fixed an issue where Chinese model names were not correctly processed.
  - FloatingGadget Stability: Fixed an issue where FloatingGadget shutdown by accident would raise errors. Changed to subscribe to WMI events for improved stability.
  - AMD Overclocking Fix: Fixed index out of bounds error in AMD overclocking for single-CCD CPUs.
  - Fan Curve Save Fix: Fixed an issue where custom fan curves would not save correctly.
  - Frequency Desync Fix: Fixed an issue where CPU/GPU frequency readings would desynchronize.
  UI/UX Improvements
  - PBO Window Enhancement: Improved PBO (Precision Boost Overdrive) Window with core index display for better visibility.
  - Drag and Drop UI: Implemented global drag-and-drop functionality for automation actions and steps.
  - UI Issue Fixes: Various UI consistency and visual bug fixes.
  Hardware Support
  - LOQ Keyboard Support: Added support for LOQ series keyboard backlight control.
  - Generation Detection: Improved hardware generation detection for better compatibility.
  System Improvements
  - Logging System Update: Refactored logging system for better performance and maintainability.
  - Power Mode Sync: Changed Power Mode / Plan sync default to be enabled by default.
  - Localization Updates: Fixed missing localization strings and improved localization consistency.
  - Updater and CI Alignment: Switched to GitHub-only channel-based updates and aligned release and build workflows for stable, beta, and dev publishing.
