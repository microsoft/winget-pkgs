  [!NOTE]
  See the Liquibase 4.31.1 Release Notes for the complete set of release information.
  Notable Changes
  [OSS]
  logicalfilepath bug: in 4.31.0, the parent logicalfilepath value will be used in DBCL/DBCLH as the changelogfilepath value, as a result the changesets from the included changelogs that were deployed with the changelog level logicalFilePath in version 4.31.0 will be considered new and will be redeployed in the latest versions. 4.31.1 fixes this behavior and deployed changesets will not be redeployed.
