ShortDescription: A modern AI gateway system that provides a unified OpenAI (Chat Completion, Responses), Anthropic, Gemini and AI SDK compatible API
Description: |-
  AxonHub is an all-in-one AI development platform that provides unified API gateway, project management, and comprehensive development tools. It offers OpenAI, Anthropic, and AI SDK compatible API layers, transforming requests to various AI providers through a transformer pipeline architecture. The platform features comprehensive tracing capabilities, project-based organization, and integrated playground for rapid prototyping, helping developers and enterprises better manage AI development workflows.
  Core Features:
  1. Unified API: OpenAI- and Anthropic-compatible interface with automatic API translation lets you use one API format to access any supported model provider.
  2. Tracing / Threads: Thread-aware tracing captures full request timelines for deep observability and faster debugging.
  3. Fine-grained Permission: RBAC-based policies help teams govern access, usage, and data segregation precisely.
  4. Adaptive Load Balancing: Intelligent multi-strategy load balancing automatically selects optimal AI channels based on health, performance, and session consistency.
