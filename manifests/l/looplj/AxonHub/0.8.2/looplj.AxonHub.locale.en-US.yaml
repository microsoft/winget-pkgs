ShortDescription: A modern AI gateway system that provides a unified OpenAI (Chat Completion, Responses), Anthropic, Gemini and AI SDK compatible API
Description: |-
  AxonHub is an all-in-one AI development platform that provides unified API gateway, project management, and comprehensive development tools. It offers OpenAI, Anthropic, and AI SDK compatible API layers, transforming requests to various AI providers through a transformer pipeline architecture. The platform features comprehensive tracing capabilities, project-based organization, and integrated playground for rapid prototyping, helping developers and enterprises better manage AI development workflows.
  Core Features:
  1. Unified API: OpenAI- and Anthropic-compatible interface with automatic API translation lets you use one API format to access any supported model provider.
  2. Tracing / Threads: Thread-aware tracing captures full request timelines for deep observability and faster debugging.
  3. Fine-grained Permission: RBAC-based policies help teams govern access, usage, and data segregation precisely.
  4. Adaptive Load Balancing: Intelligent multi-strategy load balancing automatically selects optimal AI channels based on health, performance, and session consistency.

  BREAKING CHANGES
  1. 删除了 user_roles 和 user_projects 的软删，需要手动将当前已删除的 user_roles 和 user_projects 记录删除
  DELETE FROM user_projects WHERE deleted_at <> 0;
  DELETE FROM user_roles WHERE deleted_at <> 0;
  因为这个功能应该没什么人用，变动也不大，所以不发大版本了。
