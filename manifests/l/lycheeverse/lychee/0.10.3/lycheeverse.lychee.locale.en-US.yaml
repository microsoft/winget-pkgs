  Bugfix release to improve example mail address filtering.
  This was an oversight so far that became apparent after our
  recent fix for email addreses with query params
  (e.g. test@example.com?subject=test).
  The parsing of email addresses has improved and so we detect
  more mail addresses, but we didn't check if they belonged
  to an example domain, causing false-positive checks.
