ReleaseNotes: |-
  Added
  - Added a Scan Subdirectories option for the WebDAV List, supporting up to five directory levels.
  - Added a Remove Remote Songs option for the WebDAV List. When enabled, removing a track from the list will also delete the corresponding remote file.
  - Added a Remove Local Songs option for the Local List. When enabled, removing a track from the list will also delete the corresponding local file.
  - Added an Enable Cache toggle for WebDAV Tracks, disabled by default. You can enable it at Settings > Extension Settings > WebDAV.
  - Added an Enable Debug Logs toggle in the WebDAV extension settings. You can enable it at Settings > Extension Settings > WebDAV.
  - Added a Clear Output button on the Logs Output page to clear the current output logs.
  - Added Resource Cache Management, available under Settings > Other Settings, to view and clear cached resource sizes.
  - Added Song Data Cache Management, available under Settings > Other Settings, to view and clear cached song metadata.
  - Added Disliked Songs Management, available under Settings > Other Settings, to manage songs marked as disliked.
  Improved
  - Improved WebDAV track parsing performance for faster metadata extraction.
  - Improved the tray icon behavior: on non-Windows platforms, clicking the tray icon no longer shows the main window (#103).
  - Improved the update popup's changelog display: it now shows the changelog in the user's selected language; if a translation for that language is not available, it falls back to English.
  Fixed
  - Fixed the tray menu language not updating immediately after switching the app language (#88).
  - Fixed an issue where scanning for songs could fail when the WebDAV List directory was empty or set to / while Include Subdirectories was selected.
  - Fixed an issue where scanning subdirectories in the WebDAV List could fail in certain cases.
  - Fixed an issue where album cover links would not refresh after becoming invalid.
  - Fixed an issue where the settings dropdown position could be calculated incorrectly.
  - Fixed an issue that prevented reading directories on some WebDAV services (#102).
  Changed
  - By default, WebDAV Tracks are no longer cached. Caching can be enabled manually in the WebDAV extension settings.
