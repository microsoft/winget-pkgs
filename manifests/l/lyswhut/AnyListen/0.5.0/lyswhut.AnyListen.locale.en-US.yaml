ReleaseNotes: |-
  Happy New Year! Let's keep working hard in the days ahead.
  Added
  - Added Song list sort options: File Created Time, File Updated Time, and File Size. These sorting options are available in both the Local List and WebDAV List.
  - Added Fullscreen Mode: Press F11 to toggle fullscreen; press Esc to exit fullscreen (#118).
  - Added a Delayed Metadata Parsing option for Local and WebDAV lists. Songs are added to lists quickly and their titles temporarily display the filename; metadata (tags) are parsed on demand (#111).
  - Added List Reordering for My Lists. When the lists area is focused, hold Ctrl (Command on macOS) to enter reordering mode, then drag lists to rearrange their order.
  - Added a Pause on Output Device Change option under Settings > Playback Settings. Disabled by default.
  Improved
  - Improved local list song-adding performance by adopting an "add-first-then-parse" strategy, significantly speeding up list population.
  - Improved the Now Playing page cover display (#122).
  - Improved the tooltip display for the control buttons (#127).
  Fixed
  - Fixed an issue where the Update Popup failed to correctly parse historical changelog entries.
  - Fixed incorrect playback history when playing songs queued as Play Later.
  - Fixed incorrect storage of playback history in Shuffle playback mode.
  - Fixed an issue where local songs with identical filenames could display incorrect cover art (#125).
  - Fixed an issue where the playback queue was not managed correctly when playing songs from the Play Later queue (#131).
