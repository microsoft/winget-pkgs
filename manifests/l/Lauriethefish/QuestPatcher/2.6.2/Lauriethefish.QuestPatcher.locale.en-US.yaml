  Changelog
  - Improved ADB detection: QuestPatcher will now use existing ADB daemons, avoiding conflicts between the ADB used by QuestPatcher and SideQuest.
  - Better ADB versioning - QP now checks that the ADB version it's using (e.g. from system PATH), is new enough before accepting it.
  - Added support for some older ADB versions that were commonly causing problems by manually implementing part of APK installing.
  - Removed iconfile.icns from standalone build on windows, not needed.
  - Better unhandled exception logging - unhandled exceptions now create a file on your desktop containing directions to the logs directory and the full stack trace.
  - Fixed modal views have incorrect styling resulting in unreadable text in some circumstances.
