  Changelog
  - Patcher now uses async properly instead of threading.
  - Slight optimisation of ZIP handling during patching.
  - Improvements to logging - log info stored as serilog properties correctly.
  - Update to Avalonia 11, should be evident as UI performance improvements.
  - Fix dependency download failures showing the full exception instead of handling the error.
  - Added support for drag 'n' drop of mod URLs.
    The mod will then be automatically downloaded and installed.
  - If chmod-ing mod directories fails, they will now be automatically deleted and recreated.
    Currently the cause of the failure hasn't been figured out, so this is a temporary solution.
