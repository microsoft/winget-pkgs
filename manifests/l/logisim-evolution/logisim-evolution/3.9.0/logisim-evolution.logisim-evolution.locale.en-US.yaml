ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Updated Java requirement to Java 21.
  - Added an autosave feature along with preferences for it.
  - Added a new preference to allow the user to choose the action keys for many functions.
  - Changed RAM default output from error to undefined [#1747]
  - Added support for scanning 7-segment display on FPGA-boards
  - Added first support for the openFpga toolchain for the ecp5 famely

  - Improved Chinese localization
    - Changed language code from cn to zh.
    - Chinese users (also including those who use other forks of Logisim

  - Added TTL 7487: 4-bit True/complement, zero/one elements
  - Fixed Wrong HDL generation bug in the PortIO component and added the single bit version.
  - Added TTL 74151: 8-line to 1 line data selector
  - Added TTL 74153: dual 4-line to 1 line data selector
  - Added TTL 74181: arithmetic logic unit
