ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Added reset value attribute to input pins
  - Fixed boolean algebra minimal form bug
  - Fixed random fill Rom bug
  - Added TTL 74164, 74192 and 74193.
  - Fixed off grid components bug that could lead to OutOfMemory error.
  - Removed autolabler for tunnels, such that all get the same label in case of renaming.
  - Fixed bug preventing TTL 7442, 7443 and 7444 from being placed on the circuit canvas.
  - Sub-circuit can now be deleted with DELETE key, along with BACKSPACE used so far.
  - Fixed Simulate -> Timing Diagram not opening when using "Nimbus" look and feel.
  - Fixed pressing CTRL+0 selecting the wrong element in the toolbar.
  - Fixed TTL 7485 7485HdlGenerator generating wrong HDL type.
