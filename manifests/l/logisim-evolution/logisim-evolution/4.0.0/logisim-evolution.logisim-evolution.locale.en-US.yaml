ReleaseNotes: |-
  - v4.0.0 (2025-09-07)
    - Updated VHDL and created Verilog generator for RAM component with byte-enables
    - Added VHDL and Verilog for the RAM component with line-enables
    - fixed clasic appearance shift-register bug
    - Added automatic custom Logisim library loading at startup.
      - Created unit tests for loading custom Logisim libraries at startup.
      - Updated documentation for the automatic loading of custom Logisim libraries.
    - New take on project export/import. A zip-file is generated which can include a user provided "README.md".
    - Added Telnet component.
    - Added Metal graphics acceleration option.
    - Added option to hide/show toolbar
    - Improved drawing appearance.
      - Fixed TTY appearance bug while changing various zoom levels.
      - Corrected appearance of NOT gates in TikZ/SVG image export.
      - Corrected disjoint corners in arrow-style Pins.
      - Improved output of rectangles with rounded corners in TikZ image export.
    - Fixed Undo/Redo issues.
    - Fixed Power-on-Reset propagation issue.
    - Redesigned simulation engine to fix synchronization issues and increase speed.
      - Fixed synchronization and efficiency issues in wires and propagation.
      - Fixed synchronization and efficiency issues in propagation listeners.
      - Limited redraws to about 20 frames per second to reduce overhead.
      - Allows users to choose a simulation queue, which changes the efficiency of the simulator depending on circuit design.
    - Simplified Type and Behavior attributes of Pins.
      - This change will break circuits with input pins that need to pull floating values to 0 but do not
        have the Pull Down setting. To fix it, set the Behavior attribute to Pull Down.
      - Updated Pin documentation.
    - Subcircuits with clock input(s) are now drawn with a clock symbol.
    - Added TTL 74194: 4-bit bidirectional universal shift register.
    - Improved the English, French, and German localization. Smaller fixes were done to the other languages as well.
