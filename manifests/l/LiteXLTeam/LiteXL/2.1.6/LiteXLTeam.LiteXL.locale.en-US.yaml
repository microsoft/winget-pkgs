ReleaseNotes: |-
  This releases contains general Quality-of-Life improvements to the editor, including a new icon tailored for macOS, support for highlighting CUDA files and improvements to projectsearch (e.g. search status is shown on top, horizontal scrolling is possible, and elipsis is added to long filenames).Other than that, we've optimized the renderer and now it performs anywhere from 6x to 352x faster compared to v2.1.5! You should definitely switch to v2.1.6, especially since there are no compatibility-breaking changes in this release.This third release candidate also fixes a bug on Windows that prevents processes from being started correctly (which impacts the LSP plugin).Downloads
