ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Added in ability for plugin_manager to sort and filter plugins easily. (Thank you "Big T" @takase1121!)
  - Added in ability to detect when lpm is being run not from a console on Windows, and added a pause mechanism.
  - Support symbolic links in windows.
  - Added in internal hashing mechanism, as libgit no longer provides, and mbedtls doesn't either.
  - Added in significant amount of new swtiches to modify what's included in an lpm build, full list in build.sh.
  - Allowed for unzipping of .gz when not .tar.gz.
  - Fixed errors when handling chunked transfer encoding.
  - Changed way that we construct bottles, so that we don't do as much copying. Will still copy executables in the case where it would not function if we symlinked.
  - Properly symlink folders when --symlink specified; we symlink folder contents, not the folder itself, so we no longer pollute source folders.
  - Added in the ability to create named bottles.
  - Changed behaviour of switch to simply deal with lpm defaults, rather than changing anything about the system itself.
  - Added the distinction of a primary bottle (i.e. the one we've switched to), and the system bottle (i.e. the one that has a userdir at ~/.config/lite-xl and is on the path).
  - Changed default location of CACHEDIR from USERDIR/lpm to ~/.cache/lpm. Which means that across many different user directories, we will keep a proper cache.
  - Changed the way we run bottles; we now specify LITE_USERDIR as an environment variable, rather than creating a user directory.
