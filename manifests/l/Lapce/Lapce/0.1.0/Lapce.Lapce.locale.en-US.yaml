ReleaseNotes: |-
  The biggest change in this release is that Lapce changes the GPU backend from Wgpu to OpenGL, for better compatibility, and in particular the dual-source blending feature which enabled us to do subpixel text rendering. Alongside that, we added text shaping support via Swash.

  New features:
  - WSL remote development support
  - Hover support
  - Lots of new syntax support via TreeSitter
  - warn when trying to close an unsaved buffer
  - the ability to create a scratch buffer
  - File explorer highlights the file when you change editor focus

  Bug fixes:
  - File explorer will now update when file added/removed
  - Palette input area can now do normal editing
  - Fixed lots of little UI glitches
