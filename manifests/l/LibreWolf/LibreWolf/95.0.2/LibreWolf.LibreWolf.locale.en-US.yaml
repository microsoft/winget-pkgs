ShortDescription: A fork of Firefox, focused on privacy, security and freedom.
Description: LibreWolf is designed to minimize data collection and telemetry as much as possible. This is achieved through hundreds of privacy/security/performance settings and patches. Intrusive integrated addons including updater, crashreporter, and pocket are removed too.
