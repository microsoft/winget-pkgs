Description: |-
  UEFIFind, which uses ffsParser to find image elements containing a specified pattern.

  UEFIFind  use UEFITool's engine:
  UEFITool is a cross-platform open source application written in C++/Qt, that parses UEFI-compatible firmware image into a tree structure, verifies image's integrity and provides a GUI to manipulate image's elements.
  Project development started in the middle of 2013 because of the lack of cross-platform open source utilities for tinkering with UEFI images.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Another release, another new Kaitai-based parser for a vendor variable format - Dell DVAR. Those variables don't usually have names, and use hexadecimal IDs instead, but it still can be useful to see which of them are valid and which are marked as deleted already.
  Other changes:
  - added support for unpacking yet another Microsoft-specific LZMA section
  - added support for InsydeFlashMap revision 4
  - improved Intel Microcode parsing (as Intel added new fields to the header)
  - added info on FFS volume block map (thanks to @Ykidia)
  - added tracking of recently opened files (thanks to @Ykidia)
  - fixed minor bugs (thanks to @Ykidia and @yangfl)
  - macOS build of UEFITool is now developer-signed (thanks to @vit9696)
  - updated built-in GUID database
