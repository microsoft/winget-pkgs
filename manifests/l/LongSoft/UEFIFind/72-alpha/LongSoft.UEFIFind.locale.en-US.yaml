Description: |-
  UEFIFind, which uses ffsParser to find image elements containing a specified pattern.

  UEFIFind  use UEFITool's engine:
  UEFITool is a cross-platform open source application written in C++/Qt, that parses UEFI-compatible firmware image into a tree structure, verifies image's integrity and provides a GUI to manipulate image's elements.
  Project development started in the middle of 2013 because of the lack of cross-platform open source utilities for tinkering with UEFI images.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  This release is mostly about UI improvements:
  - Dell DVAR parser output now looks more consistent with previous NVRAM parsers
  - Added "Copy item name" action, which is helpful when the name is obtained from GUID database, not UI section
  - Added "Expand/collapse whole section" actions for better control of the visibility of expandable tree items
  - Added "Hash / Hash body / Hash uncompressed" menu that calculates a chosen hash over the selected whole item / item body / item uncompressed data, shows a message box with that hash, and copies it into the clipboard.
  - Several small bugfixes here and there
  Thanks to @YangGangUEFI, @Ykidia, @MarsDoge, @cyrozap and @kocoman1 for their contributions to this release.
