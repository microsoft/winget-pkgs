Description: |-
  UEFIFind, which uses ffsParser to find image elements containing a specified pattern.

  UEFIFind  use UEFITool's engine:
  UEFITool is a cross-platform open source application written in C++/Qt, that parses UEFI-compatible firmware image into a tree structure, verifies image's integrity and provides a GUI to manipulate image's elements.
  Project development started in the middle of 2013 because of the lack of cross-platform open source utilities for tinkering with UEFI images.

  This is a major release that marks an important milestone in moving from hand-crafted parsers to ones generated from KaitaiStruct declarative DSL: all NVRAM parsers are now Kaitai-based.
  Other improvements:
  - macOS applications are now ad-hoc signed to make modern macOS hate them less (thanks to @vit9696)
  - added support for Insyde H2O FlashDeviceMap and new kind of protected ranges that are stored in that flash area
  - updated GUID database
  - updated copyright years and program authors for UEFITool
  - added support for detecting FFS volumes inside NVRAM volume (thanks to @platomav for finding a sample file and filing an issue)
