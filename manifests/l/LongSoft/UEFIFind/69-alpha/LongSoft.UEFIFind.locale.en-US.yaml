Description: |-
  UEFIFind, which uses ffsParser to find image elements containing a specified pattern.

  UEFIFind  use UEFITool's engine:
  UEFITool is a cross-platform open source application written in C++/Qt, that parses UEFI-compatible firmware image into a tree structure, verifies image's integrity and provides a GUI to manipulate image's elements.
  Project development started in the middle of 2013 because of the lack of cross-platform open source utilities for tinkering with UEFI images.
