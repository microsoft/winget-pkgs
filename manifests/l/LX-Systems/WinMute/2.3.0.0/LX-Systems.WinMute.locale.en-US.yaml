ShortDescription: WinMute lets you automatically mute your PC volume on certain events.
ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Added function to only mute specific endpoints
  - As is good tradition, also added a switch to NOT mute specific endpoints
  - Fixed a problem that WinMute never unmutes, when the PC bootet during quiet hours.
  - Fixed bluetooth muting description
  - Changed SetCoalescableTimer to SetTimer, since (apparently) only that prevented WinMute to run under Windows 7.
