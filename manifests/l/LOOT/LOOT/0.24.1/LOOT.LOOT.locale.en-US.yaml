ShortDescription: The Load Order Optimisation Tool
Description: |-
  Setting the right load order for your Starfield, TES III: Morrowind, TES IV: Oblivion, Nehrim: At Fate's Edge, TES V: Skyrim, TES V: Skyrim Special Edition, TES V: Skyrim VR, Fallout 3, Fallout: New Vegas, Fallout 4 and Fallout 4 VR mods is a crucial step to enjoying a stable modded game. The Load Order Optimisation Tool (LOOT) can help with that, by providing automated load order sorting that's simple to use and fully customisable.
  While sorting, LOOT checks for load order errors (such as incompatibilities and missing requirements) and notifies you of any issues that it detects. It also provides thousands of plugin-specific messages, such as usage notes and bug warnings, to help keep your game healthy.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Fixed
  - A performance regression was introduced in v0.24.0 when interacting with the load order, particularly when reading and writing very large load orders. Via libloot.
  - Starfield's ShatteredSpace.esm is now placed after OldMars.esm, to match where it is hardcoded to load by the game. Via libloot.
  Changed
  - Updated libloot to v0.24.5.
  - Updated ValveFileVDF to v1.0.1.
  - Updated the Russian translation.
