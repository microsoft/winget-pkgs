ShortDescription: The Load Order Optimisation Tool
Description: |-
  Setting the right load order for your Starfield, TES III: Morrowind, TES IV: Oblivion, Nehrim: At Fate's Edge, TES V: Skyrim, TES V: Skyrim Special Edition, TES V: Skyrim VR, Fallout 3, Fallout: New Vegas, Fallout 4 and Fallout 4 VR mods is a crucial step to enjoying a stable modded game. The Load Order Optimisation Tool (LOOT) can help with that, by providing automated load order sorting that's simple to use and fully customisable.
  While sorting, LOOT checks for load order errors (such as incompatibilities and missing requirements) and notifies you of any issues that it detects. It also provides thousands of plugin-specific messages, such as usage notes and bug warnings, to help keep your game healthy.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Added
  - Support for OpenMW. OpenMW differs from other games in a few ways:
    - Master-flagged plugins are not forced to load before other plugins.
    - There can be more than 255 plugins active at the same time (up to 2147483646 active plugins).
    - It's not possible to persist changes to the load order positions of inactive plugins, so if you apply a sorted load order and then reload LOOT or view the load order in another application you may not see the load order that you applied.
    - LOOT does not support ghosted plugins for OpenMW.
    - The Registry keys that LOOT uses to detect OpenMW installs on Windows are version-specific, and LOOT is only aware of OpenMW 0.48.0 and 0.49.0 (the latter is unreleased at time of writing). Other versions of OpenMW may be compatible, but LOOT will not automatically detect their install paths.
  - A Tamil translation by TamilNeram.
  Fixed
  - The groups editor graph's background was white when using the dark theme.
  - Low contrast text in the group editor's graph when using the dark theme.
  - Switching from the dark theme back to the default theme would not correctly apply the default theme on Windows until LOOT was relaunched.
  - Several cases where plugin group memberships would cause cyclic interaction errors during sorting. Via libloot.
  Changed
  - The application of plugin groups as part of the sorting process has been overhauled. As well as fixing several known bugs, the new approach avoids causing cyclic interaction errors, handles groups more consistently and is easier to understand. As a result of these changes, sorting may now give different results compared to v0.24.1 and earlier. Via libloot.
  - Sorting performance has significantly improved, particularly for larger load orders and load orders with more groups: over 2x 0.24.1's performance has been observed. Via libloot.
  - When building LOOT from source for Linux, the build process no longer falls back to downloading a precompiled libloot release if libloot is not found.
  - Updated Boost to v1.87.0.
  - Updated fmt to v11.1.3.
  - Updated libloot to v0.25.3.
  - Updated minizip-ng to v4.0.8.
  - Updated Qt to v6.8.2.
  - Updated spdlog to v1.15.1.
  - Updated TBB to v2022.0.0.
  - Updated ValveFileVDF to v1.1.0.
  - LOOT's translations are now licensed under the Creative Commons Zero 1.0 license. Some Chinese, French, and Polish translations have been removed as their authors did not respond to requests to relicense their contributions.
  - LOOT's installer now uses official Korean and Swedish Inno Setup translations.
  - Updated the Brazilian Portuguese translation.
  - Updated the Chinese translation.
  - Updated the Finnish translation.
  - Updated the German translation.
