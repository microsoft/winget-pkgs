ShortDescription: The Load Order Optimisation Tool
Description: |-
  Setting the right load order for your Starfield, TES III: Morrowind, TES IV: Oblivion, Nehrim: At Fate's Edge, TES V: Skyrim, TES V: Skyrim Special Edition, TES V: Skyrim VR, Fallout 3, Fallout: New Vegas, Fallout 4 and Fallout 4 VR mods is a crucial step to enjoying a stable modded game. The Load Order Optimisation Tool (LOOT) can help with that, by providing automated load order sorting that's simple to use and fully customisable.
  While sorting, LOOT checks for load order errors (such as incompatibilities and missing requirements) and notifies you of any issues that it detects. It also provides thousands of plugin-specific messages, such as usage notes and bug warnings, to help keep your game healthy.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Version 0.27.x was skipped to keep LOOT's minor version equal to libloot's.
  Added
  - Support for hiding individual general and plugin messages using context menu and application menu actions. Hidden messages can be unhidden globally or per card.
  - A "Show only new messages" filter that hides all messages that existed the last time LOOT ran for the current game, before its content was last refreshed, or before its masterlist was last updated while it was the current game.
  - Support for paths longer than 260 characters on Windows. This requires Windows 10 v1607 or later and a Registry value to be set to enable long paths in Windows, though LOOT may work with long paths on Windows 11 without setting the Registry value. See Microsoft's documentation_ for details. The 260-character limit is specific to Windows, so Linux builds were unaffected.
  - Support for plugin and archive symlinks when the game is Oblivion Remastered or OpenMW on Windows, and for all games on Linux.
  - Support for the DLC install paths used by the Microsoft Store's distribution of Starfield (via libloot).
  .. _Microsoft's documentation: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/maximum-file-path-limitation?tabs=registry#enable-long-paths-in-windows-10-version-1607-and-later
  Fixed
  - Detection of OpenMW on Linux.
  - Cyclic interaction error messages will no longer report blueprint master edges as unknown edges.
  - Building with Qt 6.4, which is the version of Qt provided by Debian 12 and Ubuntu 24.04.
  Changed
  - The "Empty Plugin" icon is now |empty_plugin_icon| and its old |has_hidden_messages_icon| icon is now used to indicate that a card has hidden messages.
  - Search input and content filtering regular expressions now support Unicode.
  - Message filters are now also applied to general messages, not just plugin messages.
  - Metadata parsing error messages now distinguish between prelude/masterlist errors and user metadata errors.
  - Updated LOOT's documentation, which had outdated descriptions of the sorting process and cycles involving group metadata, and was missing information about file constraint metadata and a few newer LOOT settings.
  - It's now possible to build libloot from source as part of building LOOT.
