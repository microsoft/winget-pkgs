ShortDescription: The Load Order Optimisation Tool
Description: |-
  Setting the right load order for your Starfield, TES III: Morrowind, TES IV: Oblivion, Nehrim: At Fate's Edge, TES V: Skyrim, TES V: Skyrim Special Edition, TES V: Skyrim VR, Fallout 3, Fallout: New Vegas, Fallout 4 and Fallout 4 VR mods is a crucial step to enjoying a stable modded game. The Load Order Optimisation Tool (LOOT) can help with that, by providing automated load order sorting that's simple to use and fully customisable.
  While sorting, LOOT checks for load order errors (such as incompatibilities and missing requirements) and notifies you of any issues that it detects. It also provides thousands of plugin-specific messages, such as usage notes and bug warnings, to help keep your game healthy.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Added
  - Support for TES IV: Oblivion Remastered.
    - Oblivion Remastered uses a similar load order system to Skyrim (not Skyrim Special Edition), so LOOT will similarly read and write a loadorder.txt in the same directory as Plugins.txt.
    - Like OpenMW, Oblivion Remastered does not force master plugins to load before other plugins: all plugins are treated as non-masters.
  - The tables in the plugin metadata editor's Load After, Requirements and Incompatibilities tabs have gained a Constraint column as part of supporting v0.26 of the metadata syntax.
  Fixed
  - Plugin validity checks did not consider filter patches' embedded Bash Tags, so LOOT would incorrectly display errors about missing masters for them.
  - A crash could occur when creating a game handle for an OpenMW install that does not define any user config paths. An error now occurs instead. Via libloot.
  - The description_contains() metadata condition function did not read the description field of OpenMW plugins. Via libloot.
  Changed
  - Official LOOT releases now require the MSVC 2022 redistributable, which LOOT's installer will automatically download and install if necessary.
  - Skyrim VR and Fallout 4 VR now default to the same masterlist sources as Skyrim SE and Fallout 4 respectively, as their masterlists have been merged.
  - LOOT now supports v0.26 of the metadata syntax.
  - Updated fmt to v11.1.14.
  - Updated libloot to v0.26.1.
  - Updated Qt to v6.9.0.
  - Updated spdlog to v1.15.2.
  - Updated ValveFileVDF to v1.1.1.
  - Updated the Bulgarian translation.
  - Updated the German translation.
  - Updated the Portuguese translation.
  - Updated the Russian translation.
  Removed
  - File metadata display names are no longer quoted in messages.
  - Paths in condition strings are no longer restricted to staying within the directory tree that starts one level above the gameâ€™s main plugins directory (usually the Data directory). Via libloot.
  - The audio permission from LOOT's Flatpak manifest, as it was unused.
