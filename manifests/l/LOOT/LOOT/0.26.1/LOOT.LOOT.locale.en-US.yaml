ShortDescription: The Load Order Optimisation Tool
Description: |-
  Setting the right load order for your Starfield, TES III: Morrowind, TES IV: Oblivion, Nehrim: At Fate's Edge, TES V: Skyrim, TES V: Skyrim Special Edition, TES V: Skyrim VR, Fallout 3, Fallout: New Vegas, Fallout 4 and Fallout 4 VR mods is a crucial step to enjoying a stable modded game. The Load Order Optimisation Tool (LOOT) can help with that, by providing automated load order sorting that's simple to use and fully customisable.
  While sorting, LOOT checks for load order errors (such as incompatibilities and missing requirements) and notifies you of any issues that it detects. It also provides thousands of plugin-specific messages, such as usage notes and bug warnings, to help keep your game healthy.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Added
  - A "Show only plugins with load after metadata" filter.
  - A "Show only plugins with load after user metadata" filter.
  - A "Show only plugins without load order metadata" filter, where load order metadata are load after, requirement or group metadata. It is mutually exclusive with the other two new filters.
  - Support for manual load order backups, via a new "Back Up Load Order…" action in the Game menu. LOOT already creates a load order backup whenever it's about to set the load order, but this allows a backup to be created at any time with a custom name.
  - Support for restoring load order backups, via a new "Restore Load Order…" action in the Game menu. This does not support backups created by earlier versions of LOOT, as they lack the required metadata. The Restore Load Order dialog also allows selected backups to be deleted.
  Fixed
  - Saving settings with OpenMW installed, which was accidentally broken in LOOT v0.26.0.
  - The wrong colours were used in the groups editor's graph, which could lead to very low contrast.
  - Plugin card shadows are now drawn correctly when using the dark theme.
  - Qt printed some debug console output when launching LOOT relating to layouts and some files not being found.
  Changed
  - Qt's windows11 style is now overridden with Qt's windowsvista style, as the former is relatively unpolished and looks particularly bad when using the default LOOT theme with a dark Windows colour scheme.
  - The Bash Tags group box on plugin cards now uses a style that's consistent across Windows 10 and 11, with sharp border corners and border colour that's slightly darker than it was on Windows 10 and lighter than it was on Windows 11.
  - Improve the contrast of UI colours used in the default and dark themes.
  - Improve the consistency of the colour palette used for the dark theme.
  - The format of LOOT's load order backups has changed to allow metadata to be recorded along with the plugin filenames.
  - Load order backups are now created within a backups subdirectory of the relevant game's LOOT folder instead of directly within the folder itself.
  - The maximum number of automatic load order backups that are retained per game has been increased from 3 to 10.
  - Updated the German translation.
  - Updated the Brazilian Portuguese translation.
  - Updated the Bulgarian translation.
  - Updated the Russian translation.
  - Updated fmt to v11.2.0.
  - Updated libloot to v0.26.3.
  - Updated minizip-ng to v4.0.10.
  - Updated spdlog to v1.15.3.
  Removed
  - The ability to provide a LOOT Folder name when adding a game in the settings dialog, as it was a relatively common source of confusion. LOOT will now automatically generate a suitable folder name instead.
