ShortDescription: Tools for fixing NTFS partitions and files
Description: |-
  NTFS Data Recovery Toolkit is a set of tools for analyzing problems with NTFS
  partitions and files, and Data Recovering in Manual and Automated modes.

  Manual mode allows you to analyze disk's structures and define the problem using
  included freeware Disk Editor. You can fix the problem using either Disk Editor,
  or included freeware Partition Manager, or Microsoft Windows(c) system
  utilities.

  Automated mode simplifies your work by avoiding low-level disk surface analysis,
  and lets you concentrate on a recovery of specific data using included File
  Recovery and Partition Recovery software tools.
