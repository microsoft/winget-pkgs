ShortDescription: Restore accidentally deleted partitions, fix damaged volumes and disks
Description: |-
  Active@ Partition Recovery is a freeware toolkit that helps to recover deleted
  and damaged logical drives and partitions within Windows, WinPE (recovery boot
  disk) and Linux (recovery LiveCD) environments.

  Simple QuickScan easily detects and recovers recently deleted partitions, as
  long as they were not formatted / overwritten to after deletion

  Advanced low-level SuperScan may detect partitions which were deleted a long
  time ago, even if you have created new ones and even formatted them.

  Last Chance recovery method detects and recovers files by their signatures on
  volumes having severely damaged file systems, where physical volume recovery
  isn't possible! Recovers NTFS/ReFS, ApFS, FAT/exFAT.
