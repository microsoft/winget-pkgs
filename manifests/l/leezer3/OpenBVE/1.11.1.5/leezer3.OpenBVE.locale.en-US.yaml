ShortDescription: A license-free, open source, free of charge train driving simulator.
Description: |-
  OpenBVE is a license-free, open source, free of charge train driving simulator.
  This program includes detailed per-car simulation of the brake systems, friction, air resistance, toppling and more. In 3D cabs, the driving experience is augmented with forces that shake your simulated body upon acceleration and braking, as well as in curves. Besides that, OpenBVE features a 3D positional sound system best enjoyed with surround speakers, train exteriors and timetables for the current run. Finally, via the main menu, routes and trains be easily selected to start a new session, the controls can be configured to keyboard or joystick devices, and a variety of options can be selected.
  Compared to other simulators of the genre, especially compared to commercial games, OpenBVE has its main focus on realism, not necessarily on user-friendliness. You should be willing to study operational manuals for the routes and trains you want to drive, and will in many cases not get along by just memorizing a few keystrokes. If you can identify with this focus, OpenBVE might be the right simulator for you.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Significant Changes:
  - New: Perform inline face squashing whilst loading in the MSTS Shape parser. This vastly increases the render speed of complex MSTS models.
  - New: Implement basic analog for MSTS material shaders. This should fix missing parts on many of these models.
  - Fix: Some MSTS bogie matricies were not recognised. (These are likely on OpenRails standard models)
  - Change: Improve train loading progress display. (KennyHui)
  - Change: TrainEditor2 will now write XML format trains. This is a work in progress, and not all properties are currently implemented.
  - Fix: Incorrect loaded EndSound for primary horn.
  - Fix: Correctly handle the case where a decimal is used when an integer is expected in new CFG block parser.
  - Fix: Assimp OBJ parser failing to handle faces with no normals.
  - Fix: Timetables could be missed by the bracket detection code in CSV route parser.
  - Fix: New CFG parser no longer accepts negative length cars.
  - Fix: GL.InvalidValue could be generated in debug mode.
