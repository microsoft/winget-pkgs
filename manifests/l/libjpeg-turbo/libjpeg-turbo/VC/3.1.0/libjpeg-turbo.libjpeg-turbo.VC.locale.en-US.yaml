ShortDescription: SIMD-accelerated libjpeg-compatible JPEG codec library
Description: libjpeg-turbo is a JPEG image codec that uses SIMD instructions (MMX, SSE2, NEON, AltiVec) to accelerate baseline JPEG compression and decompression on x86, x86-64, ARM, and PowerPC systems. On such systems, libjpeg-turbo is generally 2-6x as fast as libjpeg, all else being equal. On other types of systems, libjpeg-turbo can still outperform libjpeg by a significant amount, by virtue of its highly-optimized Huffman coding routines. In many cases, the performance of libjpeg-turbo rivals that of proprietary high-speed JPEG codecs.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Significant changes relative to 3.1 beta1:
  1. Fixed an issue in the TurboJPEG API whereby, when generating a lossless JPEG image with more than 8 bits per sample, specifying a point transform value greater than 7 resulted in an error ("Parameter value out of range") unless TJPARAM_PRECISION/TJ.PARAM_PRECISION was specified before TJPARAM_LOSSLESSPT/TJ.PARAM_LOSSLESSPT.
  2. Fixed a regression introduced by 1.4 beta1[3] that prevented jpeg_set_defaults() from resetting the Huffman tables to default (baseline) values if Huffman table optimization or progressive mode was previously enabled in the same libjpeg instance.
  3. Fixed an issue whereby lossless JPEG compression could not be disabled if it was previously enabled in a libjpeg or TurboJPEG instance. jpeg_set_defaults() now disables lossless JPEG compression in a libjpeg instance, and setting TJPARAM_LOSSLESS/TJ.PARAM_LOSSLESS to 0 now disables lossless JPEG compression in a TurboJPEG instance.
