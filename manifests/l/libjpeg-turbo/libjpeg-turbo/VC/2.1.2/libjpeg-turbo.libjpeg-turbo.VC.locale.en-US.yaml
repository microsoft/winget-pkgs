ShortDescription: SIMD-accelerated libjpeg-compatible JPEG codec library
Description: libjpeg-turbo is a JPEG image codec that uses SIMD instructions (MMX, SSE2, NEON, AltiVec) to accelerate baseline JPEG compression and decompression on x86, x86-64, ARM, and PowerPC systems. On such systems, libjpeg-turbo is generally 2-6x as fast as libjpeg, all else being equal. On other types of systems, libjpeg-turbo can still outperform libjpeg by a significant amount, by virtue of its highly-optimized Huffman coding routines. In many cases, the performance of libjpeg-turbo rivals that of proprietary high-speed JPEG codecs.

  Significant changes relative to 2.1.1
  1. Fixed a regression introduced by 2.1 beta1[13] that caused the remaining GAS implementations of AArch64 (Arm 64-bit) Neon SIMD functions (which are used by default with GCC for performance reasons) to be placed in the `.rodata` section rather than in the `.text` section. This caused the GNU linker to automatically place the `.rodata` section in an executable segment, which prevented libjpeg-turbo from working properly with other linkers and also represented a potential security risk.
  2. Fixed an issue whereby the `tjTransform()` function incorrectly computed the MCU block size for 4:4:4 JPEG images with non-unary sampling factors and thus unduly rejected some cropping regions, even though those regions aligned with 8x8 MCU block boundaries.
  3. Fixed a regression introduced by 2.1 beta1[13] that caused the build system to enable the Arm Neon SIMD extensions when targetting Armv6 and other legacy architectures that do not support Neon instructions.
  4. libjpeg-turbo now performs run-time detection of AltiVec instructions on FreeBSD/PowerPC systems if AltiVec instructions are not enabled at compile time. This allows both AltiVec-equipped and non-AltiVec-equipped CPUs to be supported using the same build of libjpeg-turbo.
  5. cjpeg now accepts a `-strict` argument similar to that of djpeg and jpegtran, which causes the compressor to abort if an LZW-compressed GIF input image contains incomplete or corrupt image data.
