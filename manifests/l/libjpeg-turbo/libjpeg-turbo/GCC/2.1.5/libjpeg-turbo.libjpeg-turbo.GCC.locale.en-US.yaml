ShortDescription: SIMD-accelerated libjpeg-compatible JPEG codec library
Description: libjpeg-turbo is a JPEG image codec that uses SIMD instructions (MMX, SSE2, NEON, AltiVec) to accelerate baseline JPEG compression and decompression on x86, x86-64, ARM, and PowerPC systems. On such systems, libjpeg-turbo is generally 2-6x as fast as libjpeg, all else being equal. On other types of systems, libjpeg-turbo can still outperform libjpeg by a significant amount, by virtue of its highly-optimized Huffman coding routines. In many cases, the performance of libjpeg-turbo rivals that of proprietary high-speed JPEG codecs.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  1. Fixed issues in the build system whereby, when using the Ninja Multi-Config CMake generator, a static build of libjpeg-turbo (a build in which ENABLE_SHARED is 0) could not be installed, a Windows installer could not be built, and the Java regression tests failed.
  2. Fixed a regression introduced by 2.0 beta1[15] that caused a buffer overrun in the progressive Huffman encoder when attempting to transform a specially-crafted malformed 12-bit-per-component JPEG image into a progressive 12-bit-per-component JPEG image using a 12-bit-per-component build of libjpeg-turbo (-DWITH_12BIT=1.) Given that the buffer overrun was fully contained within the progressive Huffman encoder structure and did not cause a segfault or other user-visible errant behavior, given that the lossless transformer (unlike the decompressor) is not generally exposed to arbitrary data exploits, and given that 12-bit-per-component builds of libjpeg-turbo are uncommon, this issue did not likely pose a security risk.
  3. Fixed an issue whereby, when using a 12-bit-per-component build of libjpeg-turbo (-DWITH_12BIT=1), passing samples with values greater than 4095 or less than 0 to jpeg_write_scanlines() caused a buffer overrun or underrun in the RGB-to-YCbCr color converter.
  4. Fixed a floating point exception that occurred when attempting to use the jpegtran -drop and -trim options to losslessly transform a specially-crafted malformed JPEG image.
  5. Fixed an issue in tjBufSizeYUV2() whereby it returned a bogus result, rather than throwing an error, if the align parameter was not a power of 2. Fixed a similar issue in tjCompressFromYUV() whereby it generated a corrupt JPEG image in certain cases, rather than throwing an error, if the align parameter was not a power of 2.
  6. Fixed an issue whereby tjDecompressToYUV2(), which is a wrapper for tjDecompressToYUVPlanes(), used the desired YUV image dimensions rather than the actual scaled image dimensions when computing the plane pointers and strides to pass to tjDecompressToYUVPlanes(). This caused a buffer overrun and subsequent segfault if the desired image dimensions exceeded the scaled image dimensions.
  7. Fixed an issue whereby, when decompressing a 12-bit-per-component JPEG image (-DWITH_12BIT=1) using an alpha-enabled output color space such as JCS_EXT_RGBA, the alpha channel was set to 255 rather than 4095.
  8. Fixed an issue whereby the Java version of TJBench did not accept a range of quality values.
  9. Fixed an issue whereby, when -progressive was passed to TJBench, the JPEG input image was not transformed into a progressive JPEG image prior to decompression.
