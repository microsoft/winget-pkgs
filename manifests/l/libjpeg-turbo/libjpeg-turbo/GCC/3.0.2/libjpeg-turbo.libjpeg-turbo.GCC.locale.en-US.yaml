ShortDescription: SIMD-accelerated libjpeg-compatible JPEG codec library
Description: libjpeg-turbo is a JPEG image codec that uses SIMD instructions (MMX, SSE2, NEON, AltiVec) to accelerate baseline JPEG compression and decompression on x86, x86-64, ARM, and PowerPC systems. On such systems, libjpeg-turbo is generally 2-6x as fast as libjpeg, all else being equal. On other types of systems, libjpeg-turbo can still outperform libjpeg by a significant amount, by virtue of its highly-optimized Huffman coding routines. In many cases, the performance of libjpeg-turbo rivals that of proprietary high-speed JPEG codecs.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Significant changes relative to 3.0.1:
  1. Fixed a signed integer overflow in the tj3CompressFromYUV8(), tj3DecodeYUV8(), tj3DecompressToYUV8(), and tj3EncodeYUV8() functions, detected by the Clang and GCC undefined behavior sanitizers, that could be triggered by setting the align parameter to an unreasonably large value. This issue did not pose a security threat, but removing the warning made it easier to detect actual security issues, should they arise in the future.
  2. Introduced a new parameter (TJPARAM_MAXMEMORY in the TurboJPEG C API and TJ.PARAM_MAXMEMORY in the TurboJPEG Java API) and a corresponding TJBench option (-maxmemory) for specifying the maximum amount of memory (in megabytes) that will be allocated for intermediate buffers, which are used with progressive JPEG compression and decompression, optimized baseline entropy coding, lossless JPEG compression, and lossless transformation. The new parameter and option serve the same purpose as the max_memory_to_use field in the jpeg_memory_mgr struct in the libjpeg API, the JPEGMEM environment variable, and the cjpeg/djpeg/jpegtran -maxmemory option.
  3. Introduced a new parameter (TJPARAM_MAXPIXELS in the TurboJPEG C API and TJ.PARAM_MAXPIXELS in the TurboJPEG Java API) and a corresponding TJBench option (-maxpixels) for specifying the maximum number of pixels that the decompression, lossless transformation, and packed-pixel image loading functions/methods will process.
  4. Fixed an error ("Unsupported color conversion request") that occurred when attempting to decompress a 3-component lossless JPEG image without an Adobe APP14 marker. The decompressor now assumes that a 3-component lossless JPEG image without an Adobe APP14 marker uses the RGB colorspace if its component IDs are 1, 2, and 3.
