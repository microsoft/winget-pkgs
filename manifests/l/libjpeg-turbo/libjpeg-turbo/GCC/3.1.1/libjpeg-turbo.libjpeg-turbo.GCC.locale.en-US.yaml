ShortDescription: SIMD-accelerated libjpeg-compatible JPEG codec library
Description: libjpeg-turbo is a JPEG image codec that uses SIMD instructions (MMX, SSE2, NEON, AltiVec) to accelerate baseline JPEG compression and decompression on x86, x86-64, ARM, and PowerPC systems. On such systems, libjpeg-turbo is generally 2-6x as fast as libjpeg, all else being equal. On other types of systems, libjpeg-turbo can still outperform libjpeg by a significant amount, by virtue of its highly-optimized Huffman coding routines. In many cases, the performance of libjpeg-turbo rivals that of proprietary high-speed JPEG codecs.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Significant changes relative to 3.1.0:
  1. Hardened the libjpeg API against hypothetical calling applications that may erroneously change the value of the data_precision field in jpeg_compress_struct or jpeg_decompress_struct after calling jpeg_start_compress() or jpeg_start_decompress().
