ShortDescription: SIMD-accelerated libjpeg-compatible JPEG codec library
Description: libjpeg-turbo is a JPEG image codec that uses SIMD instructions (MMX, SSE2, NEON, AltiVec) to accelerate baseline JPEG compression and decompression on x86, x86-64, ARM, and PowerPC systems. On such systems, libjpeg-turbo is generally 2-6x as fast as libjpeg, all else being equal. On other types of systems, libjpeg-turbo can still outperform libjpeg by a significant amount, by virtue of its highly-optimized Huffman coding routines. In many cases, the performance of libjpeg-turbo rivals that of proprietary high-speed JPEG codecs.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Significant changes relative to 2.1.0
  1. Fixed a regression introduced in 2.1.0 that caused build failures with non-GCC-compatible compilers for Un*x/Arm platforms.
  2. Fixed a regression introduced by 2.1 beta1[13] that prevented the Arm 32-bit (AArch32) Neon SIMD extensions from building unless the C compiler flags included `-mfloat-abi=softfp` or `-mfloat-abi=hard`.
  3. Fixed an issue in the AArch32 Neon SIMD Huffman encoder whereby reliance on undefined C compiler behavior led to crashes ("SIGBUS: illegal alignment") on Android systems when running AArch32/Thumb builds of libjpeg-turbo built with recent versions of Clang.
  4. Added a command-line argument (`-copy icc`) to jpegtran that causes it to copy only the ICC profile markers from the source file and discard any other metadata.
  5. libjpeg-turbo should now build and run on CHERI-enabled architectures, which use capability pointers that are larger than the size of `size_t`.
  6. Fixed a regression (CVE-2021-37972) introduced by 2.1 beta1[5] that caused a segfault in the 64-bit SSE2 Huffman encoder when attempting to losslessly transform a specially-crafted malformed JPEG image.
