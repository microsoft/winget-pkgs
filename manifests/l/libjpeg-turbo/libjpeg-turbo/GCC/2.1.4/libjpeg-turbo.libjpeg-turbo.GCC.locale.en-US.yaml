ShortDescription: SIMD-accelerated libjpeg-compatible JPEG codec library
Description: libjpeg-turbo is a JPEG image codec that uses SIMD instructions (MMX, SSE2, NEON, AltiVec) to accelerate baseline JPEG compression and decompression on x86, x86-64, ARM, and PowerPC systems. On such systems, libjpeg-turbo is generally 2-6x as fast as libjpeg, all else being equal. On other types of systems, libjpeg-turbo can still outperform libjpeg by a significant amount, by virtue of its highly-optimized Huffman coding routines. In many cases, the performance of libjpeg-turbo rivals that of proprietary high-speed JPEG codecs.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  1. Fixed a regression introduced in 2.1.3 that caused build failures with Visual Studio 2010.
  2. The tjDecompressHeader3() function in the TurboJPEG C API and the TJDecompressor.setSourceImage() method in the TurboJPEG Java API now accept "abbreviated table specification" (AKA "tables-only") datastreams, which can be used to prime the decompressor with quantization and Huffman tables that can be used when decompressing subsequent "abbreviated image" datastreams.
  3. libjpeg-turbo now performs run-time detection of AltiVec instructions on OS X/PowerPC systems if AltiVec instructions are not enabled at compile time. This allows both AltiVec-equipped (PowerPC G4 and G5) and non-AltiVec-equipped (PowerPC G3) CPUs to be supported using the same build of libjpeg-turbo.
  4. Fixed an error ("Bogus virtual array access") that occurred when attempting to decompress a progressive JPEG image with a height less than or equal to one iMCU (8 * the vertical sampling factor) using buffered-image mode with interblock smoothing enabled. This was a regression introduced by 2.1 beta1[6(b)].
  5. Fixed two issues that prevented partial image decompression from working properly with buffered-image mode:
    - Attempting to call jpeg_crop_scanline() after jpeg_start_decompress() but before jpeg_start_output() resulted in an error ("Improper call to JPEG library in state 207".)
    - Attempting to use jpeg_skip_scanlines() resulted in an error ("Bogus virtual array access") under certain circumstances.
