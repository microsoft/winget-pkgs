ReleaseNotes: >
  This is a small 'in between' release with just bugfixes & improvements, no new functionality. As it goes with fixing bugs in complex environments - it always creates new ones, so please keep notifying me if you find any :)

  Improvements
  Translations:

  New translation: Turkish (thanks Alp)
  New translation: Polish (thanks MichoP and team)
  Powershell sensor output support for characters like umlaut (thanks steff)

  Notifier: HASS.Agent will try to check if it has permission from Windows to show notifications

  This will only show in logs for troubleshooting purposes, no popup
  Bugfixes
  QuickActions: entity dropdown bugs on 0 entities (thanks Moldis)

  QuickActions: certain domains have their entities perpetually added (thanks Moldis)

  QuickActions: cover stop triggers media_stop [#159] (thanks @menuet88)

  WebView in tray: doesn't relocate after a resolution change

  Fast-switching between commands/local sensors gives unhandled exceptions

  Display sensor: alternative dpi results in wrong resolution, incomplete display naming [#199] (thanks @ITensEI)

  From now on, the Virtual attributes show usable resolutions
  The others contain the actual resolution, ignoring DPI
  Added RotatedDegrees as a hidden bonus feature
  Installer wrongly fails internet connectivity test [#196] (thanks @waps11)

  Post-sleep resume not correctly detected, handle disconnects/sensor update smarter [#204] (thanks everyone reporting)

  I'm unable to replicate this, so let me know if it still occurs
  MediaPlayer: media_player entity not showing up in Music Assistant integration (thanks @Protoncek)

  This required volume control to be added to the HASS.Agent integration - another hidden bonus feature
  MediaPlayer: volume always set to 0 in integration

  MediaPlayer: crash when MQTT is disabled [#156] (thanks @cbarth3)

  ProcessActive: process names with full stops get truncated (thanks benjani85)

  LoggedUser(s) sensor: show actual logged-in user instead of connected [#158], [#168] (thanks @energywave and @shuntfield)

  Powershell sensor: wrong output parsing [#201] (thanks @icegothic)

  WebView in tray: topmost not working [#160] (thanks @brainiac19 and ewonais)

  Forms freeze with non-topmost messagebox open

  MediaPlayer: only log identical monitoring errors once

  AudioSensors: Default Device volume rounding fault (thanks Chreece)
