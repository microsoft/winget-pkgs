ShortDescription: Cloud-managed secure network access
Description: LANCOM Trusted Access is the trusted network access security solution for enterprise networks. It enables secure and scalable access to enterprise applications for employees in the office, at home, or on the road, protecting modern hybrid working from anywhere, anytime. The LANCOM Trusted Access solution adapts to increasing security requirements in your organization and enables both cloud-managed VPN client networking for access to entire networks and the move to a Zero Trust security architecture for comprehensive network security. Based on granular access rights, users are only granted access to applications that have been assigned to them (Zero Trust principle). Existing systems for managing users and user groups (Active Directory) can be fully integrated into the LANCOM Management Cloud (LMC). For smaller networks, the LMC alternatively offers internal user management. LANCOM Trusted Access 100% GDPR compliant and scales for small businesses as well as for very large networks with several thousand users.
