ShortDescription: Cloud-managed secure network access
Description: LANCOM Trusted Access is the trusted network access security solution for enterprise networks. It enables secure and scalable access to enterprise applications for employees in the office, at home, or on the road, protecting modern hybrid working from anywhere, anytime. The LANCOM Trusted Access solution adapts to increasing security requirements in your organization and enables both cloud-managed VPN client networking for access to entire networks and the move to a Zero Trust security architecture for comprehensive network security.
