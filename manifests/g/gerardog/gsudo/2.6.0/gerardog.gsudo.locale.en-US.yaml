  - When elevating as a different user: Set the GSUDO_ASKPASS_NAMED_PIPE environment variable to the desired named pipe, and gsudo will connect to it as a one-time "askpass" interfaceâ€”to fetch the target user password, instead of the standard prompt, by @awakecoding in https://github.com/gerardog/gsudo/pull/388
