ShortDescription: An ultra-fast, user-friendly, and compatible grep replacement
Description: |-
  An ultra-fast, user-friendly grep replacement.
  Ugrep combines the best features of other grep, adds new things, and surpasses their search speeds.
  Includes a TUI, boolean queries (AND/OR/NOT), fuzzy search, hexdumps, searches nested archives (cpio/tar/pax/zip), compressed files (zip/gz/Z/bz2/lzma/xz/lz4/zstd), pdfs, docs, and more
ReleaseNotes: |-
  What's new?
  - improves option -w to support Unicode as planned #234
  - makes [[:alpha:]] and other [::] character classes also match Unicode by default, like \p{Class} already does, unless option -U (--ascii or --binary) is used #234
  - Unicode word boundaries \<, \>, \b, \B unless option -U (--ascii or --binary) is used #234
  - adds static Linux builds for x64 and AArch64 #373 #398 but still needs a script via wget for easy non-admin install on a system (work in progress)
  - improved bash and zsh auto-completion usability #395 #394 #392
