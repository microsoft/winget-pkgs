ShortDescription: An ultra-fast, user-friendly, and compatible grep replacement
Description: |-
  An ultra-fast, user-friendly grep replacement.
  Ugrep combines the best features of other grep, adds new things, and surpasses their search speeds.
  Includes a TUI, boolean queries (AND/OR/NOT), fuzzy search, hexdumps, searches nested archives (cpio/tar/pax/zip), compressed files (zip/gz/Z/bz2/lzma/xz/lz4/zstd), pdfs, docs, and more

ReleaseNotes: |-
  What's new?
  - includes fix #463 for v7.2 regression bug in non-SIMD ugrep builds
  Notes on unit and regression testing methodology and benchmarking:
  - to verify non-SIMD builds I ran 60,000 randomized test patterns each against 100MB text to search and compare to expected matches, this test fully covers the code of the scalar-optimized (non-SIMD) search algorithms (this test was not done for v7.2, which is my fault for thinking the latest change would not impact non-SIMD results, but it did)
  - to verify SIMD-optimized builds (SSE2/AVX2/AVX512BW and Neon/AArch64) I ran again 40,000 randomized test patterns each against 100MB text to search and compare to expected matches, this test fully covers the code of the SIMD-optimized search algorithms
  - in addition, the RE/flex high-performance regex project also includes many regex pattern test cases
  - this release does not affect the search speeds of ugrep v7 i.e. the posted benchmarks for v7 are unchanged
