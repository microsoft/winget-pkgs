ShortDescription: An ultra-fast, user-friendly, and compatible grep replacement
Description: |-
  An ultra-fast, user-friendly grep replacement.
  Ugrep combines the best features of other grep, adds new things, and surpasses their search speeds.
  Includes a TUI, boolean queries (AND/OR/NOT), fuzzy search, hexdumps, searches nested archives (cpio/tar/pax/zip), compressed files (zip/gz/Z/bz2/lzma/xz/lz4/zstd), pdfs, docs, and more
ReleaseNotes: |-
  What's new?
  - installs bash autocompletions for ugrep commands and options #327
  - installs fish and zsh autocompletions for ugrep commands and options #198
  - option -t (--file-type) now also accepts filename extensions as shortcuts, when unambiguous, for example, the shorter form -tpy for -tpython to select files to search #333
  - TUI ALT-SHIFT-% switches between "bool query lines" mode, "bool query files" mode, and bool queries off
  - TUI boolF mode (-%FQ) now applies syntax highlighting
  - support legacy grep long options without = to bind option arguments, like GNU grep also supports these legacy forms of long option arguments; in this context, note that the general recommendation is that long options which require an argument should be followed by an equals sign.
  Work in progress
  - performance improvements #288 (with updated benchmarks)
  - other requested features and updates
