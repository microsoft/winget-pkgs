ShortDescription: An ultra-fast, user-friendly, and compatible grep replacement
Description: |-
  An ultra-fast, user-friendly grep replacement.
  Ugrep combines the best features of other grep, adds new things, and surpasses their search speeds.
  Includes a TUI, boolean queries (AND/OR/NOT), fuzzy search, hexdumps, searches nested archives (cpio/tar/pax/zip), compressed files (zip/gz/Z/bz2/lzma/xz/lz4/zstd), pdfs, docs, and more
ReleaseNotes: |-
  What's new?
  - 7zip archive search with option -z #185
  - apply Unicode normalization to canonicalize literal combining characters in regex patterns #298
  - improved TUI TAB directory navigation when searching from the FS root
  - updated ugrep.exe option -P to use PCRE2 latest stable version 10.42
  Future plans (work in progress)
  - implement a new DFA-based regex search optimization for patterns described in #288
  - speed improvements for Linux with io_uring (could be 2x faster)
  - update ugrep benchmarks when some or all speed improvements are included (no update yet, because v4.5.0 is as fast as the current benchmarks show)
