ShortDescription: An ultra-fast, user-friendly, and compatible grep replacement
Description: |-
  An ultra-fast, user-friendly grep replacement.
  Ugrep combines the best features of other grep, adds new things, and surpasses their search speeds.
  Includes a TUI, boolean queries (AND/OR/NOT), fuzzy search, hexdumps, searches nested archives (cpio/tar/pax/zip), compressed files (zip/gz/Z/bz2/lzma/xz/lz4/zstd), pdfs, docs, and more
ReleaseNotes: |-
  - new TUI split screen, activated with CTRL-T, and new option --split to start the TUI with a  split screen (add split to your .ugrep configuration file to enable) #254
  - improved TUI screen updating
  - refactored the search engine internals to keep the search engine alive until ugrep terminates to optimize the TUI matching file preview pane display speed
  - improved option -o (--only-matching) layout when context options -ABC are used
  - fixed --zmax=n for n>1 that had a low chance to hang as discovered recently (about once in a few thousand runs) when searching (deeply) nested zip or tar archives
  - fixed compressed file search of files that are exactly one byte long, instead of rejecting those files as being empty
  - updated performance benchmark results: ugrep is faster than other grep tools on x64 and arm64 machines in nearly every test of 564 benchmark test cases
