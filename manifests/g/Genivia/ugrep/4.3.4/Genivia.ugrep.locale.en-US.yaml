ShortDescription: An ultra-fast, user-friendly, and compatible grep replacement
Description: |-
  An ultra-fast, user-friendly grep replacement.
  Ugrep combines the best features of other grep, adds new things, and surpasses their search speeds.
  Includes a TUI, boolean queries (AND/OR/NOT), fuzzy search, hexdumps, searches nested archives (cpio/tar/pax/zip), compressed files (zip/gz/Z/bz2/lzma/xz/lz4/zstd), pdfs, docs, and more
ReleaseNotes: |-
  What's new?

  - fix the output of + separators by no longer using them #317 for GNU grep compatibility
  - fix option -v with -ABC context #319
  - fix configuration file option arguments that may got lost and causes option argument errors in some cases after parsing a config file, such as colors=
