ShortDescription: An ultra-fast, user-friendly, and compatible grep replacement
Description: |-

  Ugrep combines the best features of other grep, adds new things, and surpasses their search speeds.
  Includes a TUI, boolean queries (AND/OR/NOT), fuzzy search, hexdumps, searches nested archives (cpio/tar/pax/zip), compressed files (zip/gz/Z/bz2/lzma/xz/lz4/zstd), pdfs, docs, and more

ReleaseNotes: |-
  What's new?
  Very pleased to release v7.4 with the following usability enhancements suggested by users:
  - more responsive output when searching slow standard input pipes, such as tail -f log | ug pattern #478; this update required several changes to the search engine's acceleration code to support non-blocking standard input, to avoid being too "greedy" for input
  - new option argument -t seed7 (or --file-type=seed7) searches seed7 files #480
  - faster -g"path/file" (or --glob="path/file". --iglob="path/file") search of the specified directory path glob to search file glob by only recursing into the specified path names/globs; likewise --include-dir="path" is optimized for path globs; these options with paths (globs containing a /) also enable option -r when -d, -r or -R are not specified #481
  - clarify the usefulness of the default to not empty-match empty-matching patterns versus GNU grep that does (as with ugrep option -Y) #482
  - option -z (or --decompress) now also auto-detects bzip2, XZ, and Zstandard compressed files (i.e. no specific filename extension is required, as is the case already for libz (gzip), compress (Z), zip, and tar/pax/cpio formats) #483
  - new option --from=FILE: read additional pathnames of files to search from FILE; this option is useful for example with find ... -print | ugrep --from=- ...' to search specific files found with the findcriteria without usingxargs` #484
  - drain the input pipe until EOF when reading non-seekable standard input such as from a pipe, for compatibility with GNU grep, this change re-enables WITH_STDIN_DRAIN in the source code
  Updated ugrep v7.4 benchmarks look as good as before
  Thank you all for your suggestions and comments!
