ShortDescription: Access OneDrive, SharePoint and Teams lightning fast with Windows Explorer
Description: |-
  KONNEKT brings all your SharePoint Online files (SharePoint Online sites, OneDrive, Teams) to your Windows File Explorer.

  Users will enjoy auto-mapping, drive letters and co-authoring. Admins can easily manage the KONNEKT clients via GPO and MDM policies.
  KONNEKT uses native SharePoint Online APIs to ensure optimal performance and security. VDI including RDS, Citrix and Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD) / Windows 365 are fully supported. Because KONNEKT works online, no local disc space is wasted.
