  ## Fixes
  - Fixes a bug where, if there are git submodules present, in some rare cases diffs my not be shown
  - Fixes a bug where an uncommitted file is partially assigned to a lane, then dragging the file to amend should only use the assigned part of the file

  - Fixes a bug where double clicking on text to select it would resize the lane
  - Fixes a bug where on the branches view, the commits in a branch were not scrollable
