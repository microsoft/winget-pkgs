  # 0.14.33
  ## Changes specific to the v3 UI
  The workspace layout and flow has been overhauled based on feedback from our community. 
  Thank you to everybody who submitted feedback and suggestions! We'd love to hear what you think of these changes!

  ### Layout
  - The "preview" panel in the middle has been removed
  - Commits and files are now previewed by dynamically expanding lanes to the right
  - Multiple lanes can now be resized at the same time with shift+dragging the resizer

  ### Commit / Pull Request creation
  - The input for creating commits and PRs is now in-place, closer to where the action was performed
  - The commit/PR input now has the ability to switch to rich editor mode on-demand

  ### Assigning uncommitted changes to lanes
  - This functionality is now finally available in v3
  - It is now possible to drag files or specific changes to a lane
  - When committing, it is also possible to pick unassigned changes, making this feature optional

  ### Other changes
  - Fixes a bug in the commit message generation not correctly considering the files to be committed
  - Fixes a bug that was preventing drag to move file from a commit into the uncommitted area
  - Fixes a bug where in some very rare cases committing yields a "hunks must be in order" error

  # 0.14.34
  - Fixes a regression where in the v2 UI the "Create PR" buttons were not rendered
  - Fixes a bug where under some conditions previewing of diffs fails with an error
