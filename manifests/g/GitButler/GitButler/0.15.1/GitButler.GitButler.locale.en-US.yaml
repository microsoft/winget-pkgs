  # 0.15.0
  ## New default GitButler UI
  - The v3 interface is now the default and it supports nearly all functionality that the old one did and much more.
  - You can temporarily switch back to the old UI under Experimental in Global Settings, but heads up â€” this option will be removed in a future release.

  Let us know if anything feels off or gets in your way!

  ## Changes
  - Pan-to-scroll: It is now possible to click to pan left and right in the workspace instead of horizontal scrolling
  - Pop-out commit input: It is now possible to make the commit input box floating if you wish to write a more detailed message
  - Scroll into view when previewing: When a file is being previewed, if the preview happens to be off-screen, it will be scrolled into view
  - When a branch lane is being drag-reordered the new position is dynamically visualized
  - When a branch lane is being reordered, the details panel is automatically collapsed
  - There is now an indication next to uncommitted files if they depend on commit from a particular branch
  - Adds an option to configure a custom OpenAI API endpoint

  ## Fixes
  - Fixed a bug where when committing sometimes the message title is not being focused
  - Fixes a bug where the "squash all" option was not being shown
  - Fixes a bug where in some rare conditions the app gets stuck in "committing" mode after all changes have been discarded
  - Fixes a bug where in some cases unapplied pull requests had a double "Apply" button
  - Fixes a bug where selecting files for previewing did not work if the name contained ':'
