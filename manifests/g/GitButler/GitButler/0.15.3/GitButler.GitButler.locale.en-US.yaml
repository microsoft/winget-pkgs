  ## Changes
  - Previewing committed files no longer expands into a third column (rendered underneath)
  - Claude Code hooks: When running multiple CC sessions, GitButler generates better branch names
  - The create branch modal can now be used for creating stacked batches as well
  - Branches with Pull Requests now have glanceable CI status
  - Commit message input - The Ruler and Wrap lines are now combined in the same button
  - Experimental: A new workspace backend can be toggled in the "experimental" section. This can help with detecting squash-merged branches as integrated but it has not been fully tests yet
  - The v2 UI is no longer available - if there are limitations in the UI that affect your workflow, please reach out so that we can fix them (We are already working on re-introducing an equivalent to "default lane")

  - Fixes a bug where drag and drop of individual hunks did not work
