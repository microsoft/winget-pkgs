ReleaseNotes: |-
  ## Changes
  - Introduces Workspace Rules - an experimental feature which lets you set up rules for assigning new code changes to lanes based on rules you configure (similar to how email rules work). Enable this under "Experimental" and let us know what you think!
  - Adds support for negative git refspecs (allowing you to exclude branches from being pushed fetched)
  - The "New workspace backend", introduced in 0.15.7 is now enabled by default which improves the detection of squash merged branches.

  ## Fixes
  - Corrects an issue where in some cases the "Push" button in not shown to be in the correct state
  - Fixes an issue with entering Japanese Kana to Kanji characters (IME)
  - When the remote integration is GitLab, the correct gitlab pandas will be displayed 
  - Fixes an issue where fetching did not ignore reference lock failures
  - Fixes a bug where the project settings were not accessible if gitbutler/workspace is not checked out
  - Output from commit hooks is now correctly displayed in a toast
  - Fixes a bug with the Claude Code hooks integration where a hooks error was triggering a loop in the CC agent
  - Fixes a bug with the Claude Code hooks integration where empty stacks are incorrectly created even when no new code changes were generated
