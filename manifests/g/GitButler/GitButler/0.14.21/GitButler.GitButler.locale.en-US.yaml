ReleaseNotes: |-
  ## New features
  - V3 User Interface: You can try out the upcoming app UI overhaul by enabling "v3 Design" in the global settings under "experimental". If you do try it out, we would love to hear your feedback. Discord , Tweet, GitHub or email - whatever works best for you.
  - It is now possible to move changes from one commit to another
  - Going back to the GitButler Workspace from another branch now works even if there are uncommitted changes - they can be carried over or stashed
  - Commit signing now reads the git config (and therefore it correctly uses the global, allowing per-project overrides)
  - It is now possible to change the frequency of auto-fetching
  - Improved committing / rebasing performance when commit signing is enabled
  - Hover on commit now shows a tooltip with the full commit title

  ## Fixes
  - Fixes a bug preventing the deletion of local branches
  - Fixes a bug where in some cases operations fail with "Merge-commit can't be remerged"
  - Fixes an issue where in some cases commit signing doesn't work due to env variable issues
  - Fixes a bug where UI context menus could go outside of window boundaries

  ### Windows
  - Fixes an issue with SSH commit signing
  - Fixes an issue where in some rare cases, a malformed settings file prevents the app from starting up

  ### Forge integrations
  - GitLab: Fixes a bug when creating stacked MRs (the head and base were swapped)
  - Bitbucket: Fixes an incorrect PR URL when the branch name includes semver
  - GitHub: Fixes a bug preventing creation of Pull Requests from a forked repo towards upstream
  - GitHub: The "Merge Pull Request" button state now correctly reflects the user's permissions (i.e. it's disabled if the action is not possible)
