  # 0.17.0

  ## Gerrit support
  GitButler now supports working Gerrit remotes. Docs: https://docs.gitbutler.com/features/gerrit-mode
  - Commits and pushes are performed in the way that a Gerrit server expects them 
  - Adding topics, hashtags, status is supported
  - Review URLs are accessible from GitButler
  - Accessible with both the GUI and the CLI

  ## GitHub integration
  - It is now possible to configure different GitHub credentials (eg. Work and Private) for different projects in the app
  - It is no longer required to be logged in with a GitButler account to be able to configure a GitHub integration. 

  ## CLI
  - You can now setup a shell auto completion `eval "$(but completions zsh)"` (NB: replace zsh with your shell of choice and add this to your respective `~/.zshrc` file)
  - It is now possible to push with the CLI (`but push --help`)
  - Status can now display code review status (`but status -r) (GitHub and Gerrit supported)
  - When referencing branch names, ambiguity is now gracefully handled.

  ## CLI Breaking changes
  - The `but` binary is now the same as the one that launches the UI (for improved compatibility) - it will be necessary to re-link it from the app settings)

  ## Codegen (Claude Code)
  - There is now an experimental feature toggle "Codegen (workspace)" which enables the ability to use Claude Code directly from the workspace (in-line with branch and commit data)
  - It is now possible to reference project files (begin typing @filename for fuzzy searching)
  - Pressing enter now produces a new line (and Cmd/Control + Enter submits) - this can be reversed in the settings

  - GitLab - Fixes an issue where "create merge request" does nothing
  - Adds Haiku as a commit/branch name generation model option
  - Fixes an issue where when setting a new base branch did not perform a checkout
