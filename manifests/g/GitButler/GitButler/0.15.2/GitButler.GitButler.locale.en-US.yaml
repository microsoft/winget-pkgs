ReleaseNotes: |-
  ## Experimental: Agentic Coding integration
  If you are using tools like Cursor or Claude Code you can now better integrate GitButler in your workflow. Cursor/VSCode/Zed can now interact with GitButler over MCP, while Claude Code can be integrated via Hooks. You can read more on the docs page: https://docs.gitbutler.com/features/ai-integration/ai-overview

  Both features are enabled via the "Experimental" feature toggle as we are tuning the behavior. 

  Please feel welcome to share any feedback, suggestions and requests on Discord, GitHub Issues or the in-app feedback button so that we can create the best workflow possible.

  ## Changes
  - The panel for "Unassigned" files can now be collapsed to create more space
  - Improved lane reordering - dragging a lane will now scroll when the window edge is approached
  - Commit message generation button once again has the "extra concise" and "use emojis" options available
  - Improved git-lfs handling via an in-app info message
  - Improved the way dependencies are communicated when diffs or parts of diffs depend on commits in a particular lane

  ## Fixes
  - Fixes a bug with text selection in diffs - lines are no longer selected on single click
  - Fixes a bug where in some cases gaps may occur between lanes
  - Fixes a bug where committing symlinks were incorrectly including the content of the file they link to
