ReleaseNotes: |-
  Changes:
  - GitButler now creates regular Git references (branches) for the lanes and stacked branches in the app. This is part of an ongoing effort to make the app better interoperate with plain Git, with more improvements coming with the next release.
  - GitButler web review (beta/preview) can now be enabled with a feature flag in the app settings
  - Claude Sonnet 3.7 is  now available within the app for commit message or branch name generation

  Fixes:
  - Fixes a bug with stacked branches where the "workspace update" appears to flatten the stack
  - Fixes a bug with commit signing not working for some users
  - Fixes a bug where the window menu option for toggling settings did not work
  - Fixes an issue where merge commits are not correctly cherry-picked when rebasing
  - Fixes a bug where the "copy" button did not work for some users due to permissions issues
  - Fixes a bug where in some cases reordering a commit in the stack errors out with an incorrect validation error
  - Fixes an issue with commit amending (drag & drop) where in some cases it didn't work as expected
  - Fixes a bug with undoing a commit (within a stack) which in some conditions would fail to remove the selected commit
