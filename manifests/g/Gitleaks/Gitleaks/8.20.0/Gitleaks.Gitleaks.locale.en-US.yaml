  Huge huge thanks to @bplaxco for supporting b64 decoding, @recreator66 for bug fixes, and to @rgmz for his continued support of the project in the form of PRs and reviews. Thanks you!New Feature: Decoding
  Sometimes secrets are encoded in a way that can make them difficult to find
  with just regex. Now you can tell gitleaks to automatically find and decode
  encoded text. The flag --max-decode-depth enables this feature (the default
  value "0" means the feature is disabled by default).Recursive decoding is supported since decoded text can also contain encoded
  text.  The flag --max-decode-depth sets the recursion limit. Recursion stops
  when there are no new segments of encoded text to decode, so setting a really
  high max depth doesn't mean it will make that many passes. It will only make as
  many as it needs to decode the text. Overall, decoding only minimally increases
  scan times.The findings for encoded text differ from normal findings in the following
  ways:
  - The location points the bounds of the encoded text
      - If the rule matches outside the encoded text, the bounds are adjusted to
  include that as well
  - The match and secret contain the decoded value
  - Two tags are added decoded:<encoding> and decode-depth:<depth>
  Currently supported encodings:
  - base64 (both standard and base64url)
