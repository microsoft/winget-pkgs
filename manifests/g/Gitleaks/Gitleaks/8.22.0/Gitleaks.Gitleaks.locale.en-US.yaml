  Changelog
  - a91c671 replace std library regex engine with go-re2 (#1669)

  This bumps the gitleaks binary size from around 8.5MB to 15MB but yields 2-4x speedup. Worth it imo. If you feel strongly against this change feel free to open an issue where we can discuss the tradeoffs in more depth. Credit to @ahrav
