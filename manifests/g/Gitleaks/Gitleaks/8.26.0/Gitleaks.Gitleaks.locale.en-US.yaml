  Changelog
  - 78eebac Percent/URL Decoding Support (#1831)
  - 6f967ca fix(kubernetes): remove slow element from pat (#1848)
  - 88f56d3 feat: identify slow file (#1479)
  - 9609928 rm 1password detect test since we test it in cfg gen
  - 23cb69f feat(rules): Add 1Password secret key detection (#1834)
  Calling this one @bplaxco's release as he introduced a really clever method for mixed decoding without sacrificing too much performance. As I stated in his PR, I think he's either a wizard or some time traveling AI. Dude is wicked smaht
  Anyways, Gitleaks now supports the following decoders: hex, percent(url enconding), and b64. It's relatively straight forward to add a new decoder so if you're motivated, community contributions are welcomed!
  Here's an example:
  ~/code/gitleaks-org/gitleaks (master) cat decode.txt
  text below
  aGVsbG8sIHdvcmxkIQ%3D%3D%0A
  text above
  ~/code/gitleaks-org/gitleaks (master) ./gitleaks dir decode.txt --max-decode-depth=2 --log-level=debug
