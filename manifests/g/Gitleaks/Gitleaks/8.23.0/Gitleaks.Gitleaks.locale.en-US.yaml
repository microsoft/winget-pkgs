  READ THIS!!! The default gitleaks config now uses [[rules.allowlists]]
      # ⚠️ In v8.21.0 `[rules.allowlist]` was replaced with `[[rules.allowlists]]`.
      # This change was backwards-compatible: instances of `[rules.allowlist]` still  work.
      #
      # You can define multiple allowlists for a rule to reduce false positives.
      # A finding will be ignored if _ANY_ `[[rules.allowlists]]` matches.
      [[rules.allowlists]]
      description = "ignore commit A"
      # When multiple criteria are defined the default condition is "OR".
      # e.g., this can match on |commits| OR |paths| OR |stopwords|.
      condition = "OR"
      commits = [ "commit-A", "commit-B"]
      paths = [
        '''go\.mod''',
        '''go\.sum'''
      ]
      # note: stopwords targets the extracted secret, not the entire regex match
      # like 'regexes' does. (stopwords introduced in 8.8.0)
      stopwords = [
        '''client''',
        '''endpoint''',
      ]

      [[rules.allowlists]]
      # The "AND" condition can be used to make sure all criteria match.
      # e.g., this matches if |regexes| AND |paths| are satisfied.
      condition = "AND"
      # note: |regexes| defaults to check the _Secret_ in the finding.
      # Acceptable values for |regexTarget| are "secret" (default), "match", and "line".
      regexTarget = "match"
      regexes = [ '''(?i)parseur[il]''' ]
      paths = [ '''package-lock\.json''' ]
