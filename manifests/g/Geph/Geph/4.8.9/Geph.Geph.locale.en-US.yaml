ShortDescription: Geph is a modular Internet censorship circumvention system designed specifically to deal with national filtering
Description: |
  - Robust zero-knowledge privacy
  We don't log you — because we can't. We use zero-knowledge authentication so that we can never associate your browsing activity with your identity.
  - Resilient anti-censorship
  Geph is on the cutting edge of censorship circumvention research. We have overcome numerous targeted attacks by China's Great Firewall, the world's most sophisticated national internet filter.
  - Accessible to all
  We believe that everyone has the right to internet freedom and privacy. So we offer entirely free medium-speed browsing for everyone. Greatly enhanced speed can be purchased for just €5/month.
  - Transparent and accountable
  Geph's entire software stack is open source and available on GitHub. Our managing organization is registered in Estonia, an EU jurisdiction with strong privacy laws.
