ReleaseNotes: |-
  Release 2.44 introduces a number of SSH improvements:
  - New terminal: The SSH terminal is now based on the same component that powers the Windows Terminal. As a result of this change, the terminal now supports a range of additional xterm features, including mouse input and support for 256 colors.
  - Browse and transfer files: When you're connected to a Linux VM, you can now browse the VM's file system and transfer files by selecting Session > Transfer files. You can transfer files by using copy and paste or drag and drop in the same way you're used to from Windows File Explorer.
  - Group policies for SFTP: You can now use a group policy to control whether users in your organization are allowed to transfer files by using SFTP.
  The release also includes these new features:
  - Connect to PostgreSQL: You can now let IAP Desktop connect to PostgreSQL and launch the psql command line client for you.
  In addition, the release includes several stability improvements and fixes, including:
  - Automatic Logons are now automatically disabled if your local computer is subject to the Do not allow passwords to be saved group policy.
  - Metadata-based SSH keys that included excess whitespace could cause authentication to fail.
  - Under certain circumstances, the installer didn't detect the Windows version correctly and refused to execute. #1580.
  A note to vim users: Because the SSH terminal now supports mouse input, coping text from vim might no longer work as before. To copy text from vim, use the set mouse=r option, or hold the Shift key while coping text.
  Update 01/07/2025: Updated packages to fix an issue with the Automated logons setting that caused IAP Desktop to ignore existing saved passwords.
