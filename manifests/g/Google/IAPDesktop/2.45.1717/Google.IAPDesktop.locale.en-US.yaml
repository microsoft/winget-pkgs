ReleaseNotes: |-
  Release 2.45 introduces a number of improvements, mostly related to SSH:
  - Bracketed pasting: When you paste clipboard content to the terminal, IAP Desktop now uses bracketed pasting again. Bracketed pasting helps maintain formatting when you copy code blocks, and lets you paste multi-line commands to a shell without immediately executing them. Bracketed pasting is on by default, but you can turn it off under Tools > Options > Terminal.
  - Updated terminal: The terminal is now based on Windows Terminal 1.21.2361, which resolves several clipboard-related issues.
  - SFTP downloading: Downloading large files over SFTP (by copy/paste or drag/drop) is now more efficient and uses a clipboard format (TYMED_ISTREAM) that doesn't require the entire file to be buffered in memory.
  - Project Explorer search: When you enter a search term in the search box, the window now perform a case-insensitive search.
  In addition, the release includes several stability improvements and fixes for the following issues:
  - Right-clicking a deleted project in the Project Explorer window sometimes showed the wrong context menu, making it difficult to unload the project.
  - Running a command that produces large quantities of output sometimes caused the SSH terminal to hang.
  - Hitting Ctrl+Alt+K early during application startup could cause the Authorized Keys window to become unfuntional.
