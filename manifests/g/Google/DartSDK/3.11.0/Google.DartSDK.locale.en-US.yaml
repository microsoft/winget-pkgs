ReleaseNotes: |-
  Released on: Unreleased
  Language
  There are no language changes in this release.
  Libraries
  dart:io
  - Added support for Unix domain sockets (AF_UNIX) on Windows. Support is restricted to the subset of features supported by the OS. Windows currently does not support the following features for AF_UNIX sockets: datagram sockets, ancillary data or abstract socket addresses. Unix domain sockets are represented in the file-system using reparse points which leads to some discrepancies in the behavior of dart:io APIs: for example File(socketPath).existsSync() will return true on POSIX operating systems, but false on Windows. Use FileSystemEntity.typeSync() instead to get portable behavior.
  dart:js_interop
  - Added a constructor to JSSymbol, as well as JSSymbol.key, JSSymbol.description, and static methods for all well-known ECMAScript symbols.
  dart:js_util
  - dart2wasm no longer supports dart:js_util. Any code that imports dart:js_util will no longer compile with dart2wasm. Consequently, code that depends on package:js will no longer compile with dart2wasm either. The name dart.library.js_util is no longer a key in dart2wasm compilation environments, including in conditional imports and exports. See #61550 for more details.
  Tools
  Analyzer
  - The Insights pages (aka the "Analysis Server Diagnostics" pages) now show data regarding the "Message Scheduler."
  - The "Fix all in workspace" command now supports a progress indicator.
  - Analysis via analyzer plugins is now faster on subsequent runs, as the analysis server will now re-use an existing AOT snapshot of the plugins entrypoint. This saves a constant amount of time at the start of each IDE session and dart analyze run, on the order of 10 seconds.
  - Various fixes are made for the call method on a Function object, like "go to definition," and completion.
  - Various fixes are made for the error and stackTrace parameters of try/catch statements.
  - Various fixes are made for syntax highlighting, navigation, code completion, hovers, quick fixes, assists, "rename" refactoring, and "go to imports."
  - Various fixes for IDE features with regards to "Dot Shorthand" syntax.
  - Improvements to LSP format-on-type, to not format in undesirable cases.
  - Various performance improvements.
  - Fixes to the 'Extract Widget' refactoring.
  - (Thanks @FMorschel and @DanTup for many of the above enhancements!)
  - A new lint rule is offered: simplify_variable_pattern, which encourages using the pattern shorthand for variables and property names of the same name.
  - The avoid_null_checks_in_equality_operators lint rule is now deprecated.
  - The prefer_final_parameters lint rule is now deprecated.
  - The use_if_null_to_convert_nulls_to_bools lint rule is now deprecated.
  Dart Development Compiler (dartdevc)
  - The async timing of the Future returned by deferred_prefix.loadLibrary() is now consistent regardless if proper deferred imports are supported in the runtime environment or not. This makes the timing more consistent with dart2js where the loads are always an async operation.
  Pub
  - "Glob" support for pub workspaces.
    Now to include all packages inside pkgs/ in the workspace, simply write:
    workspace:
      - pkgs/*
    Supported if the Dart SDK constraint of the containing package is 3.11.0 or higher.
  - New commmand dart pub cache gc for reclaiming disk space from your pub cache.
    It works by removing packages from your pub cache that are not referenced by any of your current projects.
  - New flag dart pub publish --dry-run --ignore-warnings
    Given this flag, dart pub publish --dry-run will only exit non-zero if your project validation has errors.
