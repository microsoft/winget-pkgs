ReleaseNotes: |-
  Language
  Dart 3.6 adds digit separators to the language. To use them, set your package's SDK constraint lower bound to 3.6 or greater (sdk: '^3.6.0').
  Digit separators
  Digits in number literals (decimal integer literals, double literals, scientific notation literals, and hexadecimal literals) can now include underscores between digits, as "digit separators." The separators do not change the value of a literal, but can serve to make the number more readable.
  100__000_000__000_000__000_000  // one hundred million million millions!
  0x4000_0000_0000_0000
  0.000_000_000_01
  0x00_14_22_01_23_45  // MAC address
  Separators are not allowed at the start of a number (this would be parsed as an identifier), at the end of a number, or adjacent to another character in a number, like ., x, or the e in scientific notation.
  - Breaking Change #56065: The context used by the compiler and analyzer to perform type inference on the operand of a throw expression has been changed from the "unknown type" to Object. This makes the type system more self-consistent, because it reflects the fact that it's not legal to throw null. This change is not expected to make any difference in practice.
  Libraries
  dart:io
  - Breaking Change #52444: Removed the Platform() constructor, which has been deprecated since Dart 3.1.
  - Breaking Change #53618: HttpClient now responds to a redirect that is missing a "Location" header by throwing RedirectException, instead of StateError.
  dart:js_interop
  - Added constructors for JSArrayBuffer, JSDataView, and concrete typed array types e.g. JSInt8Array.
  - Added length and []/[]= operators to JSArray.
  - Added toJSCaptureThis so this is passed in from JavaScript to the callback as the first parameter.
  - Added a static from method on JSArray to create a JSArray from a given JavaScript iterable or array-like object.
  Tools
  CFE
  - Breaking Change #56466: The implementation of the UP and DOWN algorithms in the CFE are changed to match the specification and the corresponding implementations in the Analyzer. The upper and lower closures of type schemas are now computed just before they are passed into the subtype testing procedure instead of at the very beginning of the UP and DOWN algorithms.
  Dart format
  - Preserve type parameters on old-style function-typed formals that also use this. or super..
  - Correctly format imports with both as and if clauses.
  Wasm compiler (dart2wasm)
  - The condition dart.library.js is now false on conditional imports in dart2wasm. Note that it was already a static error to import dart:js directly (see #55266).
  Pub
  - Support for workspaces. This allows you to develop and resolve multiple packages from the same repo together. See https://dart.dev/go/pub-workspaces for more info.
  - New command dart pub bump. Increments the version number of the current package.
    For example: dart pub bump minor will change the version from 1.2.3 to 1.3.0.
  - New validation: dart pub publish will warn if your git status is not clean.
  - New flag dart pub upgrade --unlock-transitive.
  - dart pub upgrade --unlock-transitive pkg, will unlock and upgrade all the dependencies of pkg instead of just pkg.
  Analyzer
  - Add the use_truncating_division lint rule.
  - Add the experimental omit_obvious_local_variable_types lint rule.
  - Add the experimental specify_nonobvious_local_variable_types lint rule.
  - Add the experimental avoid_futureor_void lint rule.
  - Add quick fixes for more than 14 diagnostics.
  - Add new assists: "add digit separators", "remove digit separators", and "invert conditional expression".
