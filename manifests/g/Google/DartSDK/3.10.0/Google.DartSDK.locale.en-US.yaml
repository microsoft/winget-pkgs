ReleaseNotes: |-
  Released on: 2025-11-12
  Language
  Dart 3.10 adds dot shorthands to the language. To use them, set your package's SDK constraint lower bound to 3.10 or greater (sdk: '^3.10.0').
  Dart 3.10 also adjusts the inferred return type of a generator function (sync* or async*) to avoid introducing unneeded nullability.
  Dot shorthands
  Dot shorthands allow you to omit the type name when accessing a static member in a context where that type is expected.
  These are some examples of ways you can use dot shorthands:
  Color color = .blue;
  switch (color) {
    case .blue:
      print('blue');
    case .red:
      print('red');
    case .green:
      print('green');
  }
  Column(
    crossAxisAlignment: .start,
    mainAxisSize: .min,
    children: widgets,
  )
  To learn more about the feature, check out the feature specification.
  Eliminate spurious Null from generator return type
  The following local function f used to have return type Iterable<int?>. The question mark in this type is spurious because the returned iterable will never contain null (return; stops the iteration, it does not add null to the iterable). This feature makes the return type Iterable<int>.
  void main() {
    f() sync* {
      yield 1;
      return;
    }
  }
  This change may cause some code elements to be flagged as unnecessary. For example, f().first?.isEven is flagged, and f().first.isEven is recommended instead.
  Tools
  Analyzer
  - The analyzer includes a new plugin system. You can use this system to write your own analysis rules and IDE quick fixes.
    - Analysis rules: Static analysis checks that report diagnostics (lints or warnings). You see these in your IDE and at the command line via dart analyze or flutter analyze.
    - Quick fixes: Local refactorings that correct a reported lint or warning.
    - Quick assists: Local refactorings available in the IDE that are not associated with a specific diagnostic.
    See the documentation for writing an analyzer plugin, and the documentation for using analyzer plugins to learn more.
  - Lint rules which are incompatible with each other and which are specified in included analysis options files are now reported.
  - Offer to add required named field formal parameters in a constructor when a field is not initialized.
  - Support the new @Deprecated annotations by reporting warnings when specific functionality of an element is deprecated.
  - Offer to import a library for an appropriate extension member when method or property is accessed on a nullable value.
  - Offer to remove the const keyword for a constructor call which includes a method invocation.
  - Remove support for the deprecated @required annotation.
  - Add two assists to bind constructor parameters to an existing or a non-existing field.
  - Add a warning which is reported when an @experimental member is used outside of the package in which it is declared.
  - Add a new lint rule, remove_deprecations_in_breaking_versions, is added to encourage developers to remove any deprecated members when the containing package has a "breaking version" number, like x.0.0 or 0.y.0.
  - (Thanks @FMorschel for many of the above enhancements!)
  Dart CLI and Dart VM
  - The Dart CLI and Dart VM have been split into two separate executables.
    The Dart CLI tool has been split out of the VM into it's own embedder which runs in AOT mode. The pure Dart VM executable is called dartvm and has no Dart CLI functionality in it.
    The Dart CLI executable parses the CLI commands and invokes the rest of the AOT tools in the same process, for the 'run' and 'test' commands it execs a process which runs dartvm.
    dart hello.dart execs the dartvm process and runs the hello.dart file.
    The Dart CLI is not generated for ia32 as we are not shipping a Dart SDK for ia32 anymore (support to execute the dartvm for ia32 architecture is retained).
  Libraries
  dart:async
  - Added Future.syncValue constructor for creating a future with a known value. Unlike Future.value, it does not allow an asynchronous Future<T> as the value of a new Future<T>.
  dart:core
  - Breaking Change #61392: The Uri.parseIPv4Address function no longer incorrectly allows leading zeros. This also applies to Uri.parseIPv6Address for IPv4 addresses embedded in IPv6 addresses.
  - The Uri.parseIPv4Address adds start and end parameters to allow parsing a substring without creating a new string.
  - New annotations are offered for deprecating specific functionalities:
    - @Deprecated.extend() indicates the ability to extend a class is deprecated.
    - @Deprecated.implement() indicates the ability to implement a class or mixin is deprecated.
    - @Deprecated.subclass() indicates the ability to extend a class or implement a class or mixin is deprecated.
    - @Deprecated.mixin() indicates the ability to mix in a class is deprecated.
    - @Deprecated.instantiate() indicates the ability to instantiate a class is deprecated.
  - The ability to implement the RegExp class and the RegExpMatch class is deprecated.
  dart:io
  - Breaking Change #56468: Marked IOOverrides as an abstract base class so it can no longer be implemented.
  - Added ability to override behavior of exit(...) to IOOverrides.
  dart:js_interop
  - JSArray.add is added to avoid cases where during migration from List to JSArray, JSAnyOperatorExtension.add is accidentally used. See #59830 for more details.
  - isA<JSBoxedDartObject> now checks that the value was the result of a toJSBox operation instead of returning true for all objects.
  - For object literals created from extension type factories, the @JS() annotation can now be used to change the name of keys in JavaScript. See #55138 for more details.
  - Compile-time checks for Function.toJS now apply to toJSCaptureThis as well. Specifically, the function should be a statically known type, cannot contain invalid types in its signature, cannot have any type parameters, and cannot have any named parameters.
  - On dart2wasm, typed lists that are wrappers around typed arrays now return the original typed array when unwrapped instead of instantiating a new typed array with the same buffer. This applies to both the .toJS conversions and jsify. See #61543 for more details.
  - Uint16ListToJSInt16Array is renamed to Uint16ListToJSUint16Array.
  - JSUint16ArrayToInt16List is renamed to JSUint16ArrayToUint16List.
  - The dart2wasm implementation of dartify now converts JavaScript Promises to Dart Futures rather than JSValues, consistent with dart2js and DDC. See #54573 for more details.
  - createJSInteropWrapper now additionally takes an optional parameter which specifies the JavaScript prototype of the created object, similar to createStaticInteropMock in dart:js_util. See #61567 for more details.
  dart:js_util
  - dart2wasm no longer supports dart:js_util and will throw an UnsupportedError if any API from this library is invoked. This also applies to package:js/js_util.dart. package:js/js.dart continues to be supported. See #61550 for more details.
