ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Fixed an issue in the extensions emulator where parameter default values would not be substitued into resource definitions.
  - Keep artifact registry dry run off for policy changes (#8419)
  - Allowed users to create paid Cloud SQL instances for Data Connect when the free trial has already been used.
  - Updated the Firebase Data Connect local toolkit to v2.2.0, which contains the following changes: (#8434)
    - Added support for aggregate functions on singular fields.
    - Added the ability to get an operation name without calling the ref function in generated web SDK.
    - Properly enforced one-of validation on inc, dec, append, and prepend update transforms. Existing deployed connectors that violate this constraint will still work, but will need to be fixed to use list syntax before being re-deployed.
    - Fixed an issue so that when using mutations with no variables, correct types are passed in.
