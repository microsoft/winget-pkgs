ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Added a deprecation warning for functions.config() to stderr on deploy and all functions:config commands. (#8808)
  - Added analytics to track runtime config usage in functions deployments (#8870).
  - Fixed issue where __name__ fields with DESCENDING order were incorrectly filtered from index listings, causing duplicate index issues (#7629) and deployment conflicts (#8859). The fix now preserves __name__ fields with explicit DESCENDING order while filtering out implicit ASCENDING __name__ fields.
  - Add service account and service enablement to firebase init apptesting
  - Updated the Firebase Data Connect local toolkit to v2.10.1, which includes the following changes: (#8884)
    - [fixed] Dart codegen: Issue where list enums weren't properly serialized and deserialized.
    - [fixed] Dart codegen: Issue where if a Variable class has a field that is a custom scalar type, and that field has an enum, the enum is set to the incorrect type.
    - [fixed] Swift codegen: For enum cases that are not known to the SDK in advance, Swift generates a _UNKNOWN case with a string associated value. The fix changes that case name from UNKNOWN to _UNKNOWN. If you have existing generated enums, you may need to rebuild your project.
    - [fixed] Kotlin codegen: Add value property to the EnumValue base interface.
    - [fixed] Dart codegen: Issue where nullable enum fields weren't setting the field itself as nullable.
