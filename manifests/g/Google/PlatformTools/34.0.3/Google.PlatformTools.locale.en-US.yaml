ShortDescription: Android SDK Platform-Tools is a component for the Android SDK. It includes tools that interface with the Android platform, primarily adb and fastboot.
Description: Although adb is required for Android app development, app developers will normally just use the copy Studio installs. This download is useful if you want to use adb directly from the command-line and don't have Studio installed. (If you do have Studio installed, you might want to just use the copy it installed because Studio will automatically update it.) fastboot is needed if you want to unlock your device bootloader and flash it with a new system image. This package used to contain systrace, but that has been obsoleted in favor of Studio Profiler, gpuinspector.dev, or Perfetto. Although some new features in adb and fastboot are available only for recent versions of Android, they're backward compatible, so you should only need the latest version of the SDK Platform-Tools and should file bugs if you find exceptions.
