ShortDescription: We provide in the libwebp codec distribution a reference implementation for the encoder and decoder applications
Description: |-
  We provide in the libwebp codec distribution a reference implementation for the encoder and decoder applications, cwebp and dwebp respectively, to showcase the available functionalities of WebP.

  cwebp compresses an image using the WebP format. Input format can be either PNG, JPEG, TIFF, WebP or raw Y'CbCr samples. Note: Animated PNG and WebP files are not supported.

  dwebp decompresses WebP files into PNG, PAM, PPM or PGM images. Note: Animated WebP files are not supported.

  gif2webp converts a GIF image to a WebP image.

  img2webp compresses a sequence of images using the animated WebP format. Input images can either be PNG, JPEG, TIFF or WebP. If a single file name (not starting with the character '-') is supplied as the argument, the command line arguments are actually tokenized from this file. This allows for easy scripting or using a large number of arguments.

  vwebp decompresses a WebP file and displays it in a window using OpenGL.

  webpinfo can be used to print out the chunk level structure and bitstream header information of WebP files. It can also check if the files are of valid WebP format.

  webpmux create animated WebP files from non-animated WebP images, extract frames from animated WebP images, and manage XMP/EXIF metadata and ICC profile.
