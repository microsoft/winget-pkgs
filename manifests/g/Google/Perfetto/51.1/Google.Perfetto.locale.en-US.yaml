ShortDescription: Performance instrumentation and tracing for Android, Linux and Chrome.
ReleaseNotes: |-
  v51.1 - 2025-06-26:
    Build system:
      * Fixed issue with Bazel copts/cxxopts. Embedders are required to add a
        default_cxxopts to their perfetto.bzl file in their repository.
  v51.0 - 2025-06-24:
    Tracing service and probes:
      * Added a new data source to poll for CPU time per UID and cluster.
    SQL Standard library:
      * Added a new standard library table for filtering IRQ slices.
      * Added a new standard library module for Android's Low Memory Killer.
    Trace Processor:
      * Reworked core database engine to be more performant and better architected
        for future imporvements.
      * Added new "trace summarization" functionality to trace processor as a more
        flexible replacement to old metrics system.
      * Added support for executing all available metrics when summarizing the
        trace with `--summary-metrics-v2 all`.
      * Added `trace_summary()` function to the Python API to execute the
        trace summaries and, specifically, v2 metrics.
      * Added support to adding SQL packages to Python API. This is the
        counterpart to the `--add-sql-package` shell option and allow loading SQL
        packages and modules from a filesystem path. These are then available to
        load using `INCLUDE PERFETTO MODULE` PerfettoSQL statements.
      * Improved handling of traces containing overlapping "complete" events
        (i.e. events with a duration, AKA 'X' events in the JSON format).
        While overlapping events are prohibited by the JSON spec, they do
        appear in many synthetically generated JSON traces. Previously, such
        events would break the data model of trace processor and cause signifcant
        glitches in the UI. These events are now dropped, fixing all the visual
        glitches and an error stat is emitted to make the user aware.
      * Improved performance of parsing JSON by 7x. JSON traces should now load
        much faster in the Perfetto UI and the trace processor.
    UI:
      * Improved JSON loading performance. See `Trace Processor` section above.
      * Improved duration based slice aggregators - slices are now trimmed to the
        width of the area selection.
      * Added the ability for users to set a custom timezone in the UI.
      * Added the ability to add descriptive text to tracks.
      * Added touchscreen support. The UI can now be used from tablets and other
        touch devices.
      * Removed the Viz page; it was an experiment which did not go anywhere.
    SDK:
      * Changed the implementation of TrackEvent to only have a single data source
        for multiple namespace; categories will be exported correctly only on
        recent perfetto tracing services that support UpdateDataSource.
      * Changed the priority of TrackEvent enabled/disabled category and tags.
        The new logic ranks (in this order)
        specific > pattern > single char "*" wildcard,
        categories (enabled > disabled) > tags (disabled > enabled).
    Docs:
      * Signifcantly improved the project's documentation with a team-wide
        collaboration to make it more user-friendly and up to date.
