ShortDescription: Performance instrumentation and tracing for Android, Linux and Chrome.
ReleaseNotes: |-
  v49.0 - 2025-01-06:
    Tracing service and probes:
      * Add `--clone-by-name` to the perfetto command line. This allows cloning a
        tracing session by its unique_session_name.
      * Fixed a bug that would delay the trace start acknowledgement, resulting
        in a 30s when using --background-wait, if an Android producer process is
        frozen, as it would be considered unresponsive.
      * Added basic support for kprobes with ftrace.
    SQL Standard library:
      * Removed the `type` column from all non-track tables. Please see
        https://perfetto.dev/docs/analysis/perfetto-sql-backcompat#change-in-semantic-of-code-type-code-column-on-track-tables
        for more information.
      * Changed the semantic of `type` column from all track tables. Please see
        https://perfetto.dev/docs/analysis/perfetto-sql-backcompat#removal-of-code-type-code-column-from-all-non-track-tables
        for more information.
      * Removed the `linux_device_track` table. Linux RPM (runtime power
        management) tracks formerly in this table now can be found in the `track`
        table with `type` `linux_rpm`.
      * Removed the `energy_counter_track` table. Android energy estimate
        breakdown tracks formerly in this table now can be found in the `track`
        table with `type` `android_energy_estimation_breakdown`.
      * Removed the `energy_per_uid_counter_track` table. Android energy estimate
        breakdown tracks formerly in this table now can be found in the `track`
        table with `type` `android_energy_estimation_breakdown_per_uid`.
      * Moved the `gpu_work_period_track` table into the `android.gpu.work_period`
        standard library module and renamed it to `android_gpu_work_period_track`.
      * Removed the `irq_counter_track` table. Irq counter tracks formerly in this
        table now can be found in the `track` table with `type`
        `irq_counter`.
      * Removed the `softirq_counter_track` table. Softirq counter tracks formerly
        in this table now can be found in the `track` table with `type`
        `softirq_counter`.
      * Removed the `uid_counter_track` table. It was redundant as no data was
        inserted directly into it.
      * Removed the `uid_track` table. It was redundant as no data was
        inserted directly into it.
      * Removed `common` package. It has been deprecated since `v42` and most
        functionality has been moved into other packages. Notably, the time
        conversion functions can be found in `time.conversion` module, and
        `thread_slice` is available with `slices.with_context`.
      * Deprecated UINT and INT integer types in Perfetto SQL. Please use LONG in
        Perfetto SQL schema.
      * Deprecated FLOAT flating type in Perfetto SQL. Please use DOUBLE in
        Perfetto SQL schema.
      * Added TIMESTAMP, DURATION, ID and JOINID types to Perfetto SQL schema.
        TIMESTAMP and DURATION refers to time columns in nanoseconds. ID column
        is a primary key for the column and JOINID is referencing ID
        column of other table.
      * Removed the `experimental_sched_upid` table. Prefer the joining `sched`
        and `thread` tables directly instead.
      * Removed the experimental_counter_dur table. Prefer using the
        `counter_leading_intervals` macro from the `counters.intervals` standard
        library module.
    UI:
      * Introduced `Open table:` command which would open any Perfetto Standard
        Library table in a new tab.
      * Various improvements to timeline rendering performance.
      * Added workspace switcher and menu to move tracks between workspaces.
      * Completely overhauled recording page.
      * Improved area selection UX.
      * Improved fuzzy search.
      * Hide 'Open with legacy UI' by default.
    SDK:
      * Added `NamedTrack`, it allows creating arbitrarily named tracks.
