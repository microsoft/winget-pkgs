ShortDescription: Performance instrumentation and tracing for Android, Linux and Chrome.
ReleaseNotes: |-
  v50.1 - 2025-04-17:
    Trace Processor:
      * Fix build on windows
  v50.0 - 2025-04-17:
    Tracing service and probes:
      * Removed mm_events support as it is no longer maintained.
    SQL Standard library:
      *
    Trace Processor:
      * Added `thread_or_process_slice` to the `slices.with_context` module for
        a unified table which contains all thread and process slices in the trace.
        This is often useful for ad-hoc queries on Android or Linux traces.
      * Removed `slices.slices` module and `_slice_with_thread_and_process_info`
        view. This is replaced by `thread_or_process_slice` (see above).
      * Fixed io_wait arg name conversion in traceconv.
    UI:
      * Added basic syntax highlighting support to the query page.
      * Retain DOM state between page changes - this fixes a bug where the scroll
        position is lost when switching between pages.
      * Added a plugin-able settings page - a place to put user-facing.
        configuration options which are more complex than a simple boolean. Flags
        should still be used for experimental features and feature flags.
      * Added paging to query results and remove arbitrary 10,000 row limit. This
        fixes a bug where selecting too many slices (e.g. `select * from slice`)
        can tank UI performance.
      * Added options to bulk-copy tracks to a new workspace.
      * Allow workspace tracks to be reordered (drag-n-drop).
      * Render slice hover tooltips to the DOM instead of canvas, which allows
        them to be larger and more customizable.
      * Add subsystem to pass URL args directly to plugins.
      * Added plugin-able track filters, including filter by process and thread.
      * Make android logs selectable, add hover-tooltips, and allow them to be
        selected when iterating search results.
      * Add flag to work around hotkey collisions on dvorak.
      * Fix bug in search where search results could not be iterated through.
      * Fix bug where to "go to next slice" hotkey was not working on AZERTY.
      * Fix bug where created pivoted debug tracks would sometimes be very slow.
      * Fix bug where tracks can get hidden behind sticky headers.
      * Fix crash when marking DNF slices.
      * Fix bug where viewer page didn't scroll back up to the top of the track
        group when a group is collapsed.
      * Small consistency tweaks to styling.
      * Stretch overview timeline to fill screen horizontally to avoid superfluous
        whitespace.
    SDK:
      * Added `TraceWriter::drop_count` function for determining the number of
        of times the writer started dropping data due to exhaustion of the shared
        memory buffer. This can be used by SDK users to diff this value and
        reemit interned data if necessary.
