  - Fixed an issue so that the PIN code won't show when both the sender and receiver are signed in with the same account, even if the receiver's visibility is set to "Receive from everyone".
  - Disallowed the bandwidth upgrade before the connection is accepted by both sides.
  - Fixed to delete files received from an unknown sender.
