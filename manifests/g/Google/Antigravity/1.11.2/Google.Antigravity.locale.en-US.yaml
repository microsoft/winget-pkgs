ShortDescription: Experience liftoffwith the next-generation IDE
Description: Google Antigravity is an agentic development platform, evolving the IDE into the agent-first era. Antigravity enables developers to operate at a higher, task-oriented level managing agents across workspaces, while retaining a familiar AI IDE experience at its core. Antigravity extracts agents into their own surface and provides them the tools needed to autonomously operate across the editor, terminal, and browser emphasizing verification and higher-level communication via tasks and artifacts. This capability enables agents to plan and execute more complex, end-to-end software tasks, elevating all aspects of development, from building features, UI iteration, and fixing bugs to research and generating reports.
