ShortDescription: Free & open-source software development toolkit that provides signal processing blocks to implement software radios.
Moniker: gnu-radio
ReleaseNotes: |-
  This release uses Python 3.9.   It also dramatically changes the dependency build process by leveraging vcpkg and pip.  AVX2 and debug specific releases are no longer being created due to low value of the AVX releases and increase risks to stability of all packages for those w/ older CPUs
  Issues Fixed:
    - wx-based utility shortcut removed
  The package managers are now responsible for versioning of the dependencies with the exception of the handful of packages that must still be built outside those two managers.
