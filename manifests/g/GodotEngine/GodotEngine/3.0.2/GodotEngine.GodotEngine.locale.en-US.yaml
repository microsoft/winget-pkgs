ShortDescription: Multi-platform 2D and 3D game engine
Description: |-
  Godot Engine is a feature-packed, cross-platform game engine to create 2D and 3D games from a unified interface.
  It provides a comprehensive set of common tools, so that users can focus on making games without having to
  reinvent the wheel. Games can be exported with one click to a number of platforms, including the major desktop
  platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows), mobile platforms (Android, iOS), as well as Web-based platforms and consoles.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  This is a fairly small release but still something to be excited about! We found some small issues with the 3.0.1 release that we've decided were worth releasing a 3.0.2 for, the most important fix being that it's now again possible to run an individual scene of a project that does not have a main scene set. We also found the reason why tooltips were disappearing for some users, a bug that we've had for a long time.
  We also have some love for C# users in this release: There was a regression using transforms from C#, and the commits that caused them have been reverted. Godot will now also no longer crash if you have a .mono directory created by an older release. This should make the C# workflow a lot better from now on.
