ReleaseNotes: Godot 3.4.1 is the first maintenance release in the 3.4 stable branch, fixing a number of issues (including some 3.4 regressions) while preserving compatibility with 3.4-stable. Alongside general bugfixing, it improves Godot's compatibility with Windows 11's new Windows Terminal, which prevented starting the Godot editor from the project manager.
