ReleaseNotes: |-
  This maintenance update provides various important bug fixes in the new 3.1 stable branch in rendering, C# support and various other areas.
  A forward incompatible change was made to the Object deserialization API to fix a security issue. GDNative plugins made for 3.1-stable should thus be recompiled for 3.1.1 and later.
