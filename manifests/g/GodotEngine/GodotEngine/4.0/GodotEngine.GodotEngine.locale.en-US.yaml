ReleaseNotes: |-
  4 years of development.
  12,000 merged pull requests.
  7,000 fixed issues.
  1,500 individual contributors across engine and docs.

  The Godot 4.0 release is by all metrics our biggest release so far.
  No stone has been left unturned, all parts of the engine have been
  modernized, refactored, overhauled, rewritten, redesigned.

  Our work is far from done. Many areas still have significant known issues,
  and will require focused work from all willing contributors to fix blocking
  bugs, implement missing features, optimize for performance or compatibility,
  and improve the user experience.

  But Godot 4.0 marks the start of the new, modern Godot Engine, and a solid
  foundation for us all to build upon. Future 4.x releases will come with a
  much faster cadence, enabling us to iterate quickly on new features and
  improvements to what we already provide.

  To all of you who were involved in making Godot 4.0 what it is today, however
  big or small your contributions were:

  THANK YOU!

  This was a massive undertaking, and you all participated in unique and
  wonderful ways to build a free and open source game engine for everyone to
  use and enjoy. You are breathtaking! <3
