ShortDescription: >
  Enlisted is an MMO squad based shooter for PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S,
  PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 in World War II where you act as an infantry
  squad leader, tank crew or an aircraft pilot.
Description: |-
  The weaponry, soldier's uniform, appearance and capabilities of the vehicles in
  the game are in line with historical facts.

  Each squad consists of several soldiers who can be trained, equipped with new
  weapons and items and then taken into a battle. You control one soldier directly
  while other soldiers will be controlled by AI which obeys your orders. You can
  switch between soldiers and stay at the most interesting point in a battle event
  after part of your squad has been defeated.

  Dozens of units with different specialisations participate in Enlisted battles
  simultaneously. This ensures maximum density and spectacularity of a battle
  while maintaining a high contribution with each participant for the victory of
  the team. Infantry, armoured vehicles and aircraft battle together and you can
  try several roles in just one game session.
