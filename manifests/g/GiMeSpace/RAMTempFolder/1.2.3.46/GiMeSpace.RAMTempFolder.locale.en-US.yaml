Description: |-
  GiMeSpace RAM Temp Folder is the Lite edition of this program. It is optimized for systems with very little memory in such a way that they can still enjoy the benefits of fast file access in the Temporary folder while avoiding needless disc access. It will only transform your temporary folder into a RAM Folder and will never use more than 128mb which is enough for typical daily windows usage.

  Please note that you can test all paid fully functional programs for 30 days for free, no payment needed!
