  WindowTop is a powerful Windows window manager and productivity tool that lets you keep any window always on top, create floating Picture-in-Picture (PiP) windows, adjust window opacity and transparency, and easily manage multiple windows with Anchors.

  Whether you want to overlay transparent windows while working, watch videos while gaming, or reduce eye strain with Dark Mode, WindowTop gives you full control over your Windows desktop multitasking. Start using it for free and unlock advanced features with the Pro version!

  Keep any window always on top of others and highlight it with a customizable colored border. Easily adjust frame color, thickness, and behavior from the Always on Top settings — perfect for multitasking, monitoring apps, or staying focused while working.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Major Feature Updates (5.28)
  Implemented support to self-update in the non-Microsoft Store version (#440).
  Until now, only a version installed through the Microsoft Store could update itself.
  If you installed the software via the regular installer and a new version was released, the user had to manually download the new installer from here and run it.
  Now, that’s no longer the case—when a new version is available, the software will simply ask if you want to update. Just click YES and the whole process will run automatically. You won’t need to do any manual work to update. Click YES to update, and it is take care for you :)
  In addition, since 5.28.6 we added traditional Chinese language thanks to 朱逸民! (#450)
