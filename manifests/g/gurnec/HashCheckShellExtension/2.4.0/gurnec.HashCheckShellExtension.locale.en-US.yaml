ReleaseNotes: |-

  - better visibility of file read errors during Checksum file creation
  - installer/uninstaller updates (primarily for Windows 10)
  - automatic CI builds on Appveyor thanks to @Chocobo1
  - initial unit tests (including Appveyor support) for Checksum verification (based on NIST test vectors) and the file properties sheet
