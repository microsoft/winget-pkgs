ReleaseNotes: |-
  - added SHA3-256 and SHA3-512 support (via the Keccak Code Package)
  - new option to select which hashes to calculate & display in the file properties sheet (MD5 and SHA3 are disabled by default)
  - Checksum file creation & verification are now multithreaded on solid state drives (Windows 7+ only)
  - all release binaries starting with this version will be digitally signed, and will display "Open Source Developer, Christopher Gurnee" as the verified publisher

    - never saves a partial Checksum file—it's either completed or it's deleted
    - better visibility of file read errors during Checksum file creation
  - installer/uninstaller updates (primarily for Windows 10)
  - automatic CI builds on Appveyor thanks to @Chocobo1
  - initial unit tests (including Appveyor support) for Checksum verification (based on NIST test vectors) and the file properties sheet
  - updated Catalan translation thanks to @Hiro5
  - updated Traditional Chinese translation thanks to @Chocobo1
  - updated Italian translation thanks to @scara
  - many other minor fixes, speed improvements, and GUI updates
