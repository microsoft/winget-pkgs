  ## Changelog

  - Fixed exit code of the `audit` command not being meaningful (now 1 for vulnerabilities and 2 for abandoned,
    3 for both) (#12203)
  - Fixed issue on plugin upgrade when it defines multiple classes (#12226)
  - Fixed duplicate errors appearing in the output depending on php settings (#12214)
  - Fixed InstalledVersions returning duplicate data in some instances (#12225)
  - Fixed installed.php sorting to be deterministic (#12197)'
  - Fixed `bump-after-update` failing when using inline constraints (#12223)
  - Fixed `create-project` command to now disable symlinking when used with a path repo as argument (#12222)
  - Fixed `validate --no-check-publish` to hide publish errors entirely as they are irrelevant (#12196)
  - Fixed `audit` command returning a failing code when composer audit fails as this should not trigger build
    failures, but running audit as standard part of your build is probably a terrible idea anyway (#12196)
  - Fixed curl usage to disable multiplexing on broken versions when proxies are in use (#12207)
