  Highlights
  Gamepad support
  With this new version, it is possible to play Android games using game controllers (for example a PS4/PS5 or XBox gamepad) connected to the computer (provided that the game supports gamepads).Like physical keyboard and mouse simulation, gamepads can use either UHID or AOA.To enable gamepad support, just run:
  scrcpy -G

  It can work without mirroring:
  scrcpy --no-video --no-audio -G

  and in OTG mode (i.e. without requiring USB debugging):
  scrcpy --otg -G

  More details in #5270 and in the documentation.--max-fps improvements
  Android accepts floating point values for the frame rate limitation, but --max-fps only accepted integers. Now, it accepts floating point values.In particular, this allows to capture at a frame rate lower than 1 fps. For example, to capture 1 frame every 5 seconds:
  scrcpy --video-source=camera --camera-size=1920x1080 --max-fps=0.2

  This might be useful for creating a timelapse. (The video can be sped up afterwards with FFmpeg.)
