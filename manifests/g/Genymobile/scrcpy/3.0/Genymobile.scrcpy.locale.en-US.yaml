  Highlights
  Virtual display
  By default, scrcpy mirrors the device screen.With this new feature (#5370), it is now possible to mirror a new virtual display, with a custom size:
  scrcpy --new-display=1920x1080
  scrcpy --new-display=1920x1080/420  # force 420 dpi
  scrcpy --new-display         # use the main display size and density
  scrcpy --new-display=/240    # use the main display size and 240 dpi

  On some devices, a launcher is available in the virtual display.When no launcher is available, the virtual display is empty. In that case, you must start an Android app.For example:
  scrcpy --new-display=1920x1080 --start-app=org.videolan.vlc

  To list the Android apps installed on the device:
  scrcpy --list-apps

  For convenience, you can also select an app by its name using a ? prefix:
  scrcpy --start-app=?firefox

  However, retrieving app names may take some time (sometimes several seconds), so passing the package name is recommended.On-device OpenGL filters
  Scrcpy can now transform the captured video stream before encoding by applying OpenGL filters directly on the device. This has made it possible to fix several issues and implement new features, as described below (more details in #5455).Crop
  The --crop option was broken for devices running Android >= 14 (#4162). It has been reimplemented using OpenGL filters internally.Its usage remains the same:
  scrcpy --crop=800:600:100:100

  It now also works for camera and virtual displays.Capture orientation
  The --lock-video-orientation option was broken for devices running Android >= 14 (#4011).It has been replaced by a more general option --capture-orientation, implemented using OpenGL filters:
  scrcpy --capture-orientation=0
  scrcpy --capture-orientation=90       # 90° clockwise
  scrcpy --capture-orientation=180      # 180°
  scrcpy --capture-orientation=270      # 270° clockwise
  scrcpy --capture-orientation=flip0    # hflip
  scrcpy --capture-orientation=flip90   # hflip + 90° clockwise
  scrcpy --capture-orientation=flip180  # hflip + 180°
  scrcpy --capture-orientation=flip270  # hflip + 270° clockwise

  The capture orientation can be locked by using a @ prefix, so that a physical device rotation does not change the captured video orientation:
  scrcpy --capture-orientation=@         # locked to the initial orientation
  scrcpy --capture-orientation=@0        # locked to 0°
  scrcpy --capture-orientation=@90       # locked to 90° clockwise
  scrcpy --capture-orientation=@180      # locked to 180°
  scrcpy --capture-orientation=@270      # locked to 270° clockwise
  scrcpy --capture-orientation=@flip0    # locked to hflip
  scrcpy --capture-orientation=@flip90   # locked to hflip + 90° clockwise
  scrcpy --capture-orientation=@flip180  # locked to hflip + 180°
  scrcpy --capture-orientation=@flip270  # locked to hflip + 270° clockwise

  Now, it also works for camera (fixing #4426) and virtual displays.Custom rotation
  A new option --angle allows to rotate the content by a custom angle. Combined with --crop, this is especially useful for mirroring the Meta Quest 3 (#4135, #4345, #4658).Virtual display rotation
  The new virtual display feature initially could not rotate. The rotation has been implemented using OpenGL filters.(That is what triggered the development of OpenGL filters.)Like previously, the current app can be rotated by MOD+r (shortcuts).Screen off timeout
  The existing option --stay-awake only keeps the device awake *while it is plugged in, meaning it typically does not work over TCP/IP.A new option, --screen-off-timeout, modifies the screen-off timeout setting while scrcpy is running and restores it on exit:
  scrcpy --screen-off-timeout=300  # 300 seconds (5 minutes)

  Static builds
  For convenience, static builds are now provided for Linux and macOS (#5515).More targets might be added in the future.This is still experimental for now, so if you encounter problems, please report them.Features you might have missed
