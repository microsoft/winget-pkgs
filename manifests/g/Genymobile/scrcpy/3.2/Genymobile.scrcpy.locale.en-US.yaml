  Highlights
  Audio sources
  In addition to the existing audio sources:
  - output (default): forwards the whole audio output, and disables playback on the device (mapped to REMOTE_SUBMIX).
  - playback: captures the audio playback (Android apps can opt out, so the whole output is not necessarily captured).
  - mic: captures the microphone (mapped to MIC).
  This version adds:
  - mic-unprocessed: captures the microphone unprocessed (raw) sound (mapped to UNPROCESSED).
  - mic-camcorder: captures the microphone tuned for video recording, with the same orientation as the camera if available (mapped to CAMCORDER).
  - mic-voice-recognition: captures the microphone tuned for voice recognition (mapped to VOICE_RECOGNITION).
  - mic-voice-communication: captures the microphone tuned for voice communications (it will for instance take advantage of echo cancellation or automatic gain control if available) (mapped to VOICE_COMMUNICATION).
  - voice-call: captures voice call (mapped to VOICE_CALL).
  - voice-call-uplink: captures voice call uplink only (mapped to VOICE_UPLINK).
  - voice-call-downlink: captures voice call downlink only (mapped to VOICE_DOWNLINK).
  - voice-performance: captures audio meant to be processed for live performance (karaoke), includes both the microphone and the device playback (mapped to VOICE_PERFORMANCE).
  See #5870.
  Note: If you record voice calls to a file, audio/video synchronization might be broken during playback. Read more details.
  Android 15 and 16
  This version includes fixes for changes in Android 15 that broke automatic rotation (#5908) and Android 16 that broke audio capture (#5698).
  Static binaries
  To ensure maximum compatibility, static binaries are now built for older versions of Linux distributions (#5689) and macOS (#5649, #5697).
