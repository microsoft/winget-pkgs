  Highlights
  Audio mirroring
  Audio forwarding was introduced in scrcpy 2.0. Until now, when audio was captured by scrcpy, it was necessarily disabled on the device.This release introduces a new audio capture method, which (optionally) supports audio duplication, to keep playing audio on the device. It is exposed as an alternative audio source named playback (in addition to output, the default, and mic).
  scrcpy --audio-source=playback               # do not play on the device
  scrcpy --audio-source=playback --audio-dup   # keep playing on the device

  For convenience, --audio-dup automatically selects the playback audio source. Therefore, to mirror audio rather than forward, this is sufficient:
  scrcpy --audio-dup

  However, this playback capture has some drawbacks:
  - it requires Android 13 (rather than Android 11),
  - Android apps can opt-out, in which case they are not captured.
  See documentation, #4380, #5102.Secondary mouse bindings
  By default, with SDK mouse:
  - right-click triggers BACK (or POWER on)
  - middle-click triggers HOME
  - the 4th click triggers APP_SWITCH
  - the 5th click expands the notification panel
  It was also possible to forward the clicks to the device instead, by using the --mouse-bind=xxxx option introduced in the previous version (2.5). But that way, we had to choose at startup whether a button triggered a shortcut or a click.This release introduces a new set of secondary bindings via Shift+click, so that both are possible at runtime.By default, a simple click triggers the shortcuts, and Shift+click forwards the click to the device.In AOA and UHID mouse modes, the default bindings are reversed: all clicks are forwarded by default, and pressing Shift gives access to the shortcuts (since the cursor is handled on the device side, it makes more sense to forward all mouse buttons by default in these modes).All these mouse bindings can be configured, check the documentation.See #5076.
