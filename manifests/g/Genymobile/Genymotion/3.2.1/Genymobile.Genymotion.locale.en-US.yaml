  Bug Fixes
  • gmtool: The ‘gmtool admin list’ command now displays the right IP for each listed device instead of 0.0.0.0 (this was a regression introduced in 3.2.0 by a change meant to improve performance).
  • application sharing: On Android 10, foreground application detection was not working, making application sharing not possible. It is fixed now.
  • player: Improved device startup reliability on slow computers. Also, Player window stays in place after performing an ‘adb reboot’. Finally, device reconnection issues for Android 9 have been fixed.
  • zsh: Fix gmtool zsh completion when installing Genymotion as root.
