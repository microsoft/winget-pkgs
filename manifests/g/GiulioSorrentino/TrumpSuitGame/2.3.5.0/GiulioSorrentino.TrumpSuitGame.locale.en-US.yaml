ShortDescription: Trump suit simulator with two players without multiplayer
Description: "Two player trump game simulator without multiplayer in avalonia. The algorithm is patented: there are 120 points in total, i.e. 4 aces worth 11 points each, 4 3s worth 10 points each, 4 10 worth 4 points each, 4 9 worth 3 points each, 4 8 worth 2 points each. Since math is not an opinion: 4*11+4*10=84. 4*4+4*3+4*2=16+12+8=36 84+36=120 total points 120/2 = 60, you need 61 points to win based only on loads you risk losing, because 84-61=23, you have to take almost all of them and leave only 23 points of loads 60-36=24, taking all the other cards only 3 loads are enough to win. So I don't put the levels, but I let you learn the theory of cards for a long time, which I invented when I was 18, with wxbriscola."
