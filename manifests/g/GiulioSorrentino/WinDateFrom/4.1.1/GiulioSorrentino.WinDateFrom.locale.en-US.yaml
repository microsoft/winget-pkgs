ShortDescription: An app for calculating how mutch time passed from an event
Description: To explain my panteted algorithm I will try to use a song that explains the female world, in a simple way: vita, morte e miracoli of Angelina Mango.
The artist easily explains everyday life in her songs, starting from the song 9 Maggio which explains why she had to win Amici.
Womans seea handsome man and begins not to build castles in the air, those come later, but mental blowjobs.
The song goes "I see myself already posing, already dressed as a bride" and then continues "after days, after days I don't even remember your name".
A woman cares not about deadlines, but about anniversaries, this means that the date of meeting is important, not the date of the first time you make... love, but the date of the first enconter.
Then comes her name and surname and it is the same beautiful madam (read honey girl) par excellence who says "after days with you I don't even remember your name". So why not create software to write down the date of the meeting and the name, but not for two or three times, otherwise it's for sluts, but for only one person at a time, perhaps accompanied by a button to delete the name and date if things don't go well.
This is female normality, women see handsome men on the street, they imagine themselves in a wedding dress but often they don't even remember their name, and they care about anniversaries.
This isn't mathematics but it's simple psychology, it means understanding the... beautiful artist, and understanding the... beautiful panorama, not cod or pes, but the fifa!
