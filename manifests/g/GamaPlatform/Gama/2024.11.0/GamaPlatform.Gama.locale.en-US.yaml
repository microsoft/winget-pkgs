ShortDescription: GAMA is an easy-to-use open source modeling and simulation environment for creating spatially explicit agent-based simulations.
Description: 'GAMA is an easy-to-use open source modeling and simulation environment for creating spatially explicit agent-based simulations. It has been developed to be used in any application domain: urban mobility, climate change adaptation, epidemiology, disaster evacuation strategy design, urban planning, are some of the application domains in which GAMA users are involved and for which they create models.'
