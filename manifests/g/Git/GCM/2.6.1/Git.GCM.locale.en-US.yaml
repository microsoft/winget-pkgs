ShortDescription: |-
  Secure, cross-platform Git credential storage with authentication to GitHub, Azure Repos, and
  other popular Git hosting services.
Description: |-
  Git Credential Manager (GCM) is a secure Git credential helper built on .NET that runs on
  Windows, macOS, and Linux. It aims to provide a consistent and secure authentication experience,
  including multi-factor auth, to every major source control hosting service and platform.

  GCM supports (in alphabetical order) Azure DevOps, Azure DevOps Server (formerly Team Foundation
  Server), Bitbucket, GitHub, and GitLab. Compare to Git's built-in credential helpers (Windows:
  wincred, macOS: osxkeychain, Linux: gnome-keyring/libsecret), which provide single-factor
  authentication support for username/password only.

  GCM replaces both the .NET Framework-based Git Credential Manager for Windows and the Java-based
  Git Credential Manager for Mac and Linux.
