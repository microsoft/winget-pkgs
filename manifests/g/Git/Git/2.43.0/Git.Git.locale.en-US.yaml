ReleaseNotes: |-
  New Features
  - Comes with Git v2.43.0.
  - Comes with MSYS2 runtime v3.4.9.
  - Comes with GNU TLS v3.8.1.
  - When installing into a Windows setup with Mandatory Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) enabled, which is incompatible with the MSYS2 runtime powering Git Bash, SSH and some other programs distributed with Git for Windows, the Git for Windows installer now offers to add exceptions that will allow those programs to work as expected.
  - Comes with OpenSSH v9.5.
    P1.
  - Comes with cURL v8.4.0.
  - Comes with OpenSSL v3.1.4.
  - Comes with Git Credential Manager v2.4.1.
  - Comes with Bash v5.2.21.
  - Comes with MinTTY v3.7.0.
  Bug Fixes
  - Symbolic links whose target is an absolute path _without_ the drive prefix accidentally had a drive prefix added when checked out, rendering them "eternally modified".
    This bug has been fixed.
  - Git for Windows's installer is no longer confused by global GIT_* environment variables.
  - The installer no longer claims that "fast-forward or merge" is the default git pull behavior: The default behavior has changed in Git a while ago, to "fast-forward only".
