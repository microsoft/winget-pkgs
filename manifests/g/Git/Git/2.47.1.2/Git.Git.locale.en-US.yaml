  - CVE-2024-50349: When prompting the user for a password in the terminal, Git does not neutralize control characters.
  - CVE-2024-52005: The sideband channel does not neutralize control characters.
  - CVE-2024-52006: Similar to CVE-2020-5260, affecting credential helpers that interpret Carriage Returns as newlines.
