  Changes since Git for Windows v2.47.1(2) (January 14th 2025)
  Git for Windows v2.48.1 is the last version to ship with the i686 ("32-bit") variant of the installer, portable Git and archive. Only 32-bit MinGit will be built for future versions, until April 2029.
  Due to persistent maintenance challenges and the community's limited engagement and usage, git svn support in Git for Windows will be phased out over the next few months.
  New Features
  - Comes with Git v2.48.1.
  - Comes with MinTTY v3.7.7.
  - New Git for Windows installation now default to the Windows-native HTTPS transport backend.
  - Comes with the MSYS2 runtime (Git for Windows flavor) based on Cygwin v3.5.7 (Git for Windows skipped v3.5.5 because it failed to pass Git's test suite, and Cygwin v3.5.6 was superseded too quickly).
  - Comes with Tig v2.5.12.
  - Comes with cURL v8.12.1.
  - Comes with OpenSSL v3.2.4.
  Bug Fixes
  - The installer now correctly blocks the installation on Windows 7 and Windows 8 as these versions of Windows are no longer supported since Git for Windows v2.47.0
  - When using the cache credential helper, it could error out with "fatal: unable to connect to cache daemon: Unknown error" under certain circumstances; This was fixed.
  - Git for Windows used to issue a misleading warning when .gitignore was a directory, which has been fixed.
