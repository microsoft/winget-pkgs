  Changes since Git for Windows v2.46.2 (September 24th 2024)Git for Windows for Windows v2.47 drops support for Windows 7 and for Windows 8, as announced previously.Please also note that the 32-bit variant of Git for Windows is deprecated; Its last official release is planned for 2025.New Features
  - Comes with Git v2.47.0.
  - Comes with the MSYS2 runtime (Git for Windows flavor) based on Cygwin v3.5.4, which drops Windows 7 and Windows 8 support.
  - The new, experimental git backfill command was added: It helps fetching relevant Git objects smartly in a partial, sparse clone.
  - The new, experimental git survey command was added. This command is designed to help identify less-than-ideal data shape in monorepos, and it will likely see highly active development. Stay tuned!
