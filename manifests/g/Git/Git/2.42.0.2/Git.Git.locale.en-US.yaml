  Bug Fixes
  - Git for Windows v2.42.0's release notes claimed that it ships with Git LFS v3.4.0, which is incorrect and has been fixed in this release.
  - The installer option to enable support for Pseudo Consoles has been handled incorrectly since Git for Windows v2.41.0, which has been fixed.
  - Some Git commands (those producing paged output, for example) experienced a significant slow-down under certain circumstances, when running on a machine joined to a domain controller, which has been fixed.
  - As of Git for Windows v2.41.0, when installed into a location whose path contains non-ASCII characters, it was no longer possible to fetch from/push to remote repositories via https://, which has been fixed.
