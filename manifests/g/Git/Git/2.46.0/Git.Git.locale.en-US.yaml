ReleaseNotes: |-
  Changes since Git for Windows v2.45.2 (June 3rd 2024)Git for Windows for Windows v2.46 is the last version to support for Windows 7 and for Windows 8, see MSYS2's corresponding deprecation announcement (Git for Windows relies on MSYS2 for components such as Bash and Perl).Please also note that the 32-bit variant of Git for Windows is deprecated; Its last official release is planned for 2025.New Features
  - Comes with Git v2.46.0.
  - Comes with OpenSSL v3.2.2.
  - Comes with PCRE2 v10.44.
  - Comes with OpenSSH v9.8.P1.
  - Comes with Git Credential Manager v2.5.1.
  - Comes with MinTTY v3.7.4.
  - git config respects two user-wide configs: .gitconfig in the home directory, and .config/git/config. Since the latter isn't a Windows-native directory, Git for Windows now looks for Git/config in the AppData directory, unless .config/git/config exists.
  - The FSMonitor feature is no longer experimental, and therefore no longer offered as installer option. Users are encouraged to enable this on a per-repository basis, via the config setting core.fsmonitor=true (scalar clone does this automatically).
  - The server-side component of OpenSSH, which had been shipped with Git for Windows for historical reasons only, is now no longer distributed with it.
  - Comes with cURL v8.9.0.
  Bug Fixes
  - Git Bash's ls command can now be used in OneDrive-managed folders without having to hydrate all the files.
  - Git LFS v3.5.x and newer no longer support Windows 7. Instead of a helpful error message, it now simply crashes on that Windows version, leaving the user with the error message "panic before malloc heap initialized". This has been addressed: In addition to the unhelpful error message, Git is now saying what is going on and how to get out of the situation.
  - As of v2.45.0, the manual pages of git clone and git init were broken, which has been fixed.
