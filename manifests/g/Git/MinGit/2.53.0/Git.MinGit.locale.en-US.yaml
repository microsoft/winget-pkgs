ShortDescription: MinGit is an intentionally minimal, non-interactive distribution of Git for Windows, with third-party applications as its intended audience.
Description: |-
  MinGit is a minimal, lightweight version of Git for Windows that includes only the core Git command-line tools.
  It's designed for automated environments, CI/CD pipelines, and users who need basic Git functionality without the full Git for Windows package, which includes Git Bash, GUI tools, and other utilities.
  MinGit offers a smaller footprint and can be used portably without installation.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Changes since Git for Windows v2.52.0 (November 17th 2025)
  New Features
  - Comes with Git v2.53.0.
  - Pressing the Tab key in an empty line in Git Bash no longer causes the session to "freeze".
  - Git for Windows' installer is now built by InnoSetup v6.6.1.
  - Comes with cURL v8.18.0.
  - Microsoft Edit can now be specified as Git editor.
  - Comes with Git Credential Manager v2.7.0, the "anniversary release" after one release-less year, which brings native x64 and ARM64 binaries for the respective flavors of Git for Windows.
  - Upgrades the memory allocator mimalloc that is used by Git for Windows to v2.2.7.
  - Comes with the MSYS2 runtime (Git for Windows flavor) based on Cygwin v3.6.6.
  - Comes with OpenSSL v3.5.5.
  Bug Fixes
  - The installer of Git for Windows v2.52 showed clipped text in some setups, which was fixed.
  - When calling Microsoft Store apps, their standard I/O is now set up correctly (meaning: You can call an interactive Python interpreter without the winpty hack mentioned in the release notes' Known Issues).
  - The astextplain tool (which is used by Git for Windows to generate diffs of .pdf and .doc files) used to handle empty files gracefully. This behavior is now reinstated.
