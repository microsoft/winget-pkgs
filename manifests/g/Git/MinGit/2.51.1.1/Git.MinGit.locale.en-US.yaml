ReleaseNotes: |-
  Changes since Git for Windows v2.51.0(2) (September 29th 2025)
  This is a security release! Git LFS (which is enabled by default in Git for Windows) fixes CVE-2025-26625 (Severity rated High, 8.6 / 10) in v3.7.1. Please only clone or pull from repositories you trust until you upgraded.
  Due to persistent maintenance challenges and the community's limited engagement and usage, git svn support in Git for Windows will be dropped from the next major Git for Windows release.
  Note that git flow is no longer shipped with Git for Windows, after a version had been distributed that had been languishing for years. Even the original, years-stale Git Flow project has been archived.
  New Features
  - Comes with Git v2.51.1.
  - Comes with Git LFS v3.7.1, addressing CVE-2025-26625.
  - Comes with OpenSSL v3.5.4.
  - Comes with the MSYS2 runtime (Git for Windows flavor) based on Cygwin v3.6.5.
  - Comes with OpenSSH v10.2.P1.
  - Drops git flow.
  Bug Fixes
  - A potential memory corruption in the optional wincred credential helper was fixed.
