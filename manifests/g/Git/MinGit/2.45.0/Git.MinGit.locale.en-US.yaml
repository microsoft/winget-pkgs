  ### Changes since Git for Windows v2.44.0 (February 23rd 2024)

  Git for Windows for Windows v2.45 is the last version to support for Windows 7 and for Windows 8, see MSYS2's
  corresponding deprecation announcement (Git for Windows relies on MSYS2 for components such as Bash and Perl).

  Please also note that the 32-bit variant of Git for Windows is deprecated; Its last official release is planned for
  2025.

  ### New Features

  - Comes with Git v2.45.0.
  - Comes with PCRE2 v10.43.
  - Comes with GNU Privacy Guard v2.4.5.
  - Comes with Git LFS v3.5.1.
  - MinGit now supports running git difftool.
  - Comes with OpenSSH v9.7.P1.
  - Comes with GNU TLS v3.8.4.
  - Comes with Tig v2.5.9.
  - Comes with cURL v8.7.1.
  - Comes with Git Credential Manager v2.5.0.

  ### Bug Fixes

  - Since v2.14.0(2), Git for Windows' installer registers the Open Git Bash here and Open Git GUI here context menu
    items also in the special Libraries folders, but the uninstaller never removed them from those folders, which was
    fixed.
  - A regression where git clone no longer worked in the presence of includeIf.*.onbranch config settings has been fixed.
  - Apparently some anti-malware programs fiddle with the mode of stdout which can lead to problems because expected
    output is missing, which was fixed.
