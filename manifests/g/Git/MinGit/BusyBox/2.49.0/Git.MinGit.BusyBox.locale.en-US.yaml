  Changes since Git for Windows v2.48.1 (February 13th 2025)
  Due to persistent maintenance challenges and the community's limited engagement and usage, git svn support in Git for Windows will be phased out over the next few months.
  Git for Windows v2.48.1 was the last version to ship with the i686 ("32-bit") variant of the installer, portable Git and archive. Only 32-bit MinGit will be built for future versions, until April 2029.
  New Features
  - Comes with Git v2.49.0.
  - Comes with OpenSSH v9.9.P2.
  - Comes with PCRE2 v10.45.
  - The previously-experimental --full-name-hash option has been accepted into upstream Git as --name-hash-version=2 and is no longer experimental.
  - The git backfill command has been accepted into upstream Git; Its --batch-size=<n> option has been renamed to --min-batch-size=<n>, though.
  Bug Fixes
  - A change in upstream Git v2.48.0 broke renaming symlinks, which was fixed.
  - On a recent Insider Windows version, users experienced the message: "Cygwin WARNING: Couldn't compute FAST_CWD pointer", which has been fixed.
  - A bug has been fixed that, when calling git add -p from VS Code's internal terminal, after using the edit command, caused the internal terminal got stuck and no further command was accepted.
  - The syntax highlighting of the nano editor was recently disabled in Git for Windows by mistake, which was fixed.
