ReleaseNotes: |-
  Changes since Git for Windows v2.47.0(2) (October 22nd 2024)

  This release comes with the first early native support of Windows/ARM64, ready for testing (the
  included Git Bash is actually not native, for technical reasons, but the git.exe is a native
  ARM64 executable). Please report any issues!

  ### New Features

  - Comes with Git v2.47.1.
  - Comes with cURL v8.11.0.
  - Comes with Git LFS v3.6.0.

  ### Bug Fixes

  - Due to a bug introduced in the v2.47 cycle, the installer showed an empty "experimental options" page, which was fixed.
  - A potential crash in Git Bash on Insider versions of Windows/ARM64 was fixed.
  - On Windows/ARM64, running the 64-bit version of Git for Windows could infrequently cause deadlocked threads (see e.g.
    this report or this one), which was addressed.
