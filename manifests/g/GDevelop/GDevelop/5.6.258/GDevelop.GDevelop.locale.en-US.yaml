ReleaseNotes: |-
  New ready-to-use "Custom Objects"
  Volume controls and game over dialogs are now available in the list of objects which can be imported in your game, with multiple designs coming from the asset store. These are ready-to-use objects, built thanks to GDevelop custom objects ("prefabs") feature.

  We encourage you check how they are built and edit them to create new "variants" to adapt them to your game:

  As with all custom objects ("prefabs"), custom behaviors and extensions in general, they are open-source and available as extensions and ready-made assets on the Asset Store: feel free to open a Pull Request/issue to submit improved versions or new design variants.
  💝 Improvements
  - Improve resource tab with shortcuts: rename, delete and navigate resources with arrows
  - Add an action to close game lobbies window (usually not useful as the window is closing by itself, but could be used in some cases if the game wants to force the window to close).
  - Improve tooltip background color for all themes
  - Improve the Diagnostic Report (thanks @malec-palec!):
    - Add a shortcut (F7 by default) and command in the command palette to open diagnostic report at any time.
    - The report now scans project for missing actions/conditions/expressions from extensions and reports invalid parameters (shown with red underline in Events Sheet)
    - Click on error location to navigate directly to the event
  - Improve Tilemap edition with new tools:
    - New Freehand Brush tool: it works with multiple tiles and single tile.
    - New Picker tool (when used, your previous tool before picking is saved and restored once picking is done)
    - New Bucket Fill tool: it can replace existing tiles or empty spaces. Filling is limited to the tilemap bounds within the canvas.
    - The Rectangle tool replaces the old Paint Brush tool.
    - Optimize drawing performance: reduce and limit the number of points stored while the cursor moves.
  - Add support for local variables for loop events (While, Repeat, For Each, For Each Child Variable) and loop counter variable:
    - Right click/long press on an event and choose "Add" then "Loop Counter Variable" or "Local Variable".
    - The loop counter starts from 0 and is automatically increased by 1 each time the event is repeated.
    - "For Each Child Variable" now also properly support choosing local variables for the variable to iterate on, for the variable where to store the child and the optional variable where to store the name. Using local variables for these is highly encouraged.
  🐛 Bug fixes
  - Fix image preview in Resources Editor blinking with wrong dimensions for a split second
  - Fix else events not working properly when after a disabled event or comment:
    - Also improve the UI to not show horizontal bars for disabled events and comments
  - Fix url params not handled when doing a preview over network
  - Fix paste in JS events losing formatting
  - Fix multi selection of actions/conditions not working anymore
  ⚙️ Extensions
  - [Reviewed] [3D particle] Allow to emit trail particles
  - [Reviewed] Update Discord rich presence internal package
  🎨 Assets
  - Add ready-to-use volume controls and game over dialogs "custom objects".
  🛠 Internal changes (for developers)
  - Fix generated code for events (and Else) not working with 'use strict'
  - Upgrade to Flow 0.299.0:
    - Please run npm install in newIDE/app. Relaunch VSCode/Cursor/your IDE and make sure the latest Flow version (0.299.0) is used.
    - It should be way faster and crash way less.
