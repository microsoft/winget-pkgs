ReleaseNotes: |-
  üíù Improvements
  - Add new course "Introduction to Javascript in GDevelop"
    - It will be made available in the next few days, as a stand-alone course and also available in the Indie Kickstarter Studio Bundle.
    - This is for users looking to learn JavaScript basics, implement complex patterns in their games, and learn how to manipulate GDevelop objects through JavaScript.
  - AI Agent improvements:
    - Improve Layers and Camera documentation, so the agent can more reliably modify layer properties,
    - Improve the AI to allow the agent to modify (or add or remove) object groups in scenes,
    - allow using "up" and "down" arrows to navigate through chat history in the AI agent & chat.
  - Improve previews on the web-app:
    - Support for hot-reloading (like on the desktop app),
    - Huge speed-up (no more file uploads, everything is done locally on the device storage),
    - Fix for Safari/Firefox not opening the preview window.
  üêõ Bug fixes
  - Fix Tilemaps layers visibility not being taken into account in the game
  - Fix default value of "String with options" wrongly reset in the extension editor
  - Fix .fnt loading for files generated by some tools
    - A new "header" has been added in every .fnt generated with the common BitmapFont generator at http://snowb.org/. They will now be properly loaded.
  - Fix leaderboard entry rate limiting: this enforces a limit of 12 successful saves per minute globally and 6 per minute per leaderboard.
    This is more than enough for the very large majority of games. This will avoid issues when sending too many scores because of a mistake or wrong game design.

  - [Community] [3D collision] Fix the distance expressions
