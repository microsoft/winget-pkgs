ReleaseNotes: |-
  ⚙️ Support for "Else" events
  You can now add Else in the events sheet, after a traditional event:

  The Else is a "logical statement": the event will run its conditions and execute its actions only if the previous event conditions are not met. Objects are picked like in a traditional event (without considering what happened in the previous event).
  While "Else" are rarely used in GDevelop compared to a traditional programming language, it can be useful when building logic where you're doing checks on a variable and changing it, or any logic where you want to be sure that only one event execute and skip others if one was executed.
  💝 Improvements
  - Upgrade the desktop app as well as exported games to run with Electron v32 (thanks @arthuro555!)
    - This should provides various performance improvements and better rendering/GPU support.
  - Add support for skin management in Spine objects (thanks @ViktorVovk!)
  - Allow opening multiple GDevelop windows on Desktop:
    - This is useful to open multiple projects at the same time for instance.
    - This was previously causing issues where GDevelop was stuck trying to log in.
  - Optimize simple tile maps with huge dimensions: they are now are faster to create and modify at runtime.
  - Allow to override behavior properties on object instances: for now, this is limited to instances inside custom objects. This will be made available in the future for all instances in scenes if this works well.
  - Display an audio preview in the resources editor and when editing actions.
  - Add support for custom toolbar buttons on GDevelop desktop version (thanks @malec-palec!). This adds support for configurable toolbar buttons in the GDevelop desktop editor that execute npm scripts from a package.json file stored next to your project file. Buttons must be defined in a gdevelop-settings.yaml file, also stored in the project directory.
    For example, create a gdevelop-settings.yaml containing:
    toolbarButtons:
      - name: "Build"
        icon: "🔨"
        npmScript: "build"
      - name: "Test"
        icon: "🧪"
        npmScript: "test"
  - Add 45-degree rotation with Alt key in the 3D editor

  - Fix crash when renaming with F2 to edit "Base layer".
  - Fix possible crash when deleting an object whose instance was highlighted in canvas
  - Fix list items height calculation to prevent crashes (infinite re-renders)
