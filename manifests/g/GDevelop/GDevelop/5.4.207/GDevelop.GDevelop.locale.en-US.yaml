  🖌️ Build your 2D levels with tiles (Tilemaps) directly inside GDevelop
  A new, built-in Tilemap object is now available in GDevelop. It's perfect to quickly build levels with tiles, without leaving GDevelop or requiring setup from an external editor. Tilemaps are quick to render and perfect for displaying big levels without losing in performance.
  You can directly configure it with an image (called Tileset, or Atlas), drag it on the scene then paint tiles after selecting one in the properties panel. You can also define which tiles are "solid" so that they are considered as a platform if you use the "Platform" behavior (or Collision conditions).

  Read more on the Tilemap documentation page.
  This is a new feature that will be improved in the future: open-source contributors are welcome to add tools (flood fill, 9-patch rectangle), multiple tiles selection for painting or auto-tiling.
  🎮 Multiplayer improvements
  - Lobby start is now more reliable (will wait for everyone to be connected to the host to start the game) and faster. If a player can't connect, the game will still start after a bit of time.
  - Lobbies can now be joined after the game is started, if defined as such in the lobbies section of the game dashboard (which will be on by default for new games). Actions & conditions to check when a new player joins are available if needed.

  👪 Define and modify variable for Object Groups
  Object Groups allow to share the same events for multiple objects. While it's convenient, using variables with groups was painful because variables had to be added to every single object of the group before they could be used.
  You can now open the group and see the variables that are in common in all objects of the group. Adding a variable to a group will add the variable to all objects. Adding an object to an existing group will ensure all variables of the group are also applied on the object.

  Finally, you can also now directly open group variables when editing an action or condition using a variable. This is convenient to quickly add a variable to a group while you're building your game logic. Read more on the documentation page about Object Groups.
