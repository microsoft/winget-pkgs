  üíù Improvements
  üë• Editor improvements
  - Merge project manager & app burger menu buttons
    - The goal of this change is to simplify the top left corner of the app, by merging the App burger menu and the Project manager button into one. Having 2 buttons was causing confusion in the flow of using the app, by mistakenly pressing the wrong button.
    - The app menu buttons that are useful are now displayed at the top of the project manager drawer, on the relevant platforms: Web, Windows & mobile, because other platforms have a built-in OS menu.
  - When choosing an object/group in an action/condition:
    - Folders that are set in the objects list can now be used here to navigate, making the browsing experience consistent
    - When searching for an action/condition, exact matches are displayed first, making the search more accurate
  - When a preview is updated on the web-app, the correct window is automatically focused
  - Improve subscription perks display when subscribing and all the subscription-related design
  - Objects installed from the asset store are now installed in the selected folder, instead of the root of the scene
  - Allow to toggle between drop-down list and expression for mouse button and key parameters
  - Add Pixi and Three type definitions for JS events
  - Extension editor improvements:
    - Add autocompletion for keyboard key properties in the behavior editor
    - Allow behavior properties to be an animation name, displayed with a selector
  ‚öôÔ∏è Engine improvements
  - Text input object improvements
    - New attributes are available: padding (vertical and horizontal), max length and text alignment.
    - A new condition "Input is submitted" was added to check if the user validated the value in the input.
  - Allow to use parameters and properties in the variable action and condition
  - Allow 3D physics characters to push each other
  - Make the 2D and 3D physics engine much more performant when you have a lot of static objects, by reducing the CPU work on these
  üêõ Bug fixes
  - 3D physics character behavior
    - Fix a 1-frame delay on the "is falling" condition
    - Fix the "is falling" condition from being true when the character is going up
    - Fix the behavior to keep rotation around X and Y intact
  - Fix parameters list not updating when the function configuration was changed
  - Fix a crash when opening a project missing a custom object that was loaded in the previously opened project
  - Fix issue where cubes were not showing when they have all their faces shown with no textures
  - Fix variable list usability
    - When renaming a variable in the instance panel, the caret position is kept and the user can erase the whole field without the name being replaced by "Unnamed" instantly
    - When opening the variables editor from a variable field, the currently selected variable is selected in the list (even if child of a variable)
  - Fix correctly exporting desktop icon when project is saved in the cloud
  - Fix opening windows in foreground on windows everywhere in app
  - Fix: Disable panel sprite tilling by default, as it decreases the performance of the object without any advantage
