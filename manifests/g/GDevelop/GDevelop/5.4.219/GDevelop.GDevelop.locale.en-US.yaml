  üíù Improvements
  - Add a new option for layers, to keep a layer centered when the game size changes, or keep it top-left fixed (as before).
    - This is useful for layers which you want to stay on the center of the screen, which works well with the new option to extend width/height of the project without cropping the game area.
    - If you already move the camera using events, this won't have any impact.
    - This also works well when using the Anchor behavior to position objects on the screen.

  - New, reworked "Create new game" dialog. It is now the entry point for creating a new game, allowing to:
    - create an empty project from scratch
    - (new!) use a "starting point" for your projects, to bootstrap your platformer, top-down or physics game. They are extremely simple template, with minimal gameplay, perfect for new users discovering GDevelop.
    - start from a project customized by an AI,
    - or as before, one of the many free or premium templates provided with GDevelop.

  - Add an option in the game properties to extend width or height and never crop the game area.
    - This can be used to ensure your game area is always fully displayed, with a background layer on which you use the "Anchor" behavior to position a tiled sprite or other objects:
  As well as a few more improvements:
  - Projects linked to a game are now shown and can be opened directly from the game dashboard.
    - If a cloud project is not shown, it's usually enough to open it from the Build tab and save it so that it appears in the game dashboard.
  - Add "Create new folder" menu item inside "Move to folder" menu.
  - Improve LAN preview network to detect local ip properly for Network previews
  üêõ Bug fixes
  - Fix for the anchor behavior when used on layers where the camera was moved. Anchored objects will now work whatever their layer and camera position.
  - Fix potential crashes in events function edition
    - Also hide object groups tabs in functions (unless there are groups already) - it's not recommended to use them anymore.
  - Fix custom objects inner area expansion on Z axis
  - Fix variables from being renamed with a property
  - Fix position conflicts between Physics and other movement behaviors
  - Fix: Build tilemap renderer from an empty tilemap to be able to create tilemaps in-game
  - Fix the parameter name field to avoid changing the name when no change was done
  - Fix height when switching to mobile design
  - Fix function configuration editor layout when shown as a side panel
  - Fix publish flow to allow creating gd.games links if game is not owned
  - Disable the variable editor button wrongly shown for object parameters
  - Properly show error box to user when an error occurred when creating student accounts
  - Fix a crash when Physics behavior is used on object smaller than 0.1 pixels
