  🎮 Introducing support for Multiplayer games ("GDevelop Multiplayer" - experimental)
  ℹ️ This is an experimental feature, which is still in a very early stage and will be improved fast in the short term.
  GDevelop now supports building real-time multiplayer games. Watch the announcement video here. Multiplayer includes:
  - Lobbies for your game and a user interface allowing players to start a new game,
  - 2 to 8 players in each lobby,
  - Built-in authentication for players to create an account and login to your game,
  - Automatic choice of the host of the game,
  - Automatic synchronization of players, depending on who is in charge of each object,
  - Automatic synchronization of the rest of the game state: game objects, variables...
  - Soon, automated compression to reduce bandwidth usage.

  Building a multiplayer game works by using 1) the actions to display the lobbies for your game and 2) a new Multiplayer Object behavior, allowing to mark which objects are active in the game (players, projectiles, enemies, doors, etc.)
  This video shows how to transform a static game with 2 objects in a multiplayer game in 1 minute:

  Servers are usually costly to set up and maintain for multiplayer games (from tens to thousands dollars a month for successful games). GDevelop Multiplayer is built so that it can scale from no players to multiple thousands playing to your game. Free accounts have one lobby available for the game with 4 players. With a silver, gold or pro account, your game will get unlimited lobbies so your game can work with any number of players. Gold and Pro memberships will get access to extra customization and monetisation options in the future.
  Examples are available in the app to help you get started, you can also preview a few multiplayer games here:
  - Platformer ArrowFight on gd.games
  - The Squeal of Time on gd.games by @tristanbob.
  Read more about multiplayer game creation on this page.
  💾 Simplified variable actions/conditions, local variables and extension variables.
  The variable system has been considerably revised to be even more simple to use and flexible:
  - Global or scene variables of any type can now be used with a unique action and condition. For example, you don't need anymore to choose between an action to modify a scene or a global variable, as there is now a single action for it. In the action, both global and scene variables can be used. You also don't need to choose a different action for a number, text or boolean variable.
  - It's now required to declare your variables: add them in the global or scene variables. You can open these when editing events too, so you don't lose much time in case your forgot to create one before working on an action or condition.
  Declaring variables is useful for GDevelop to allow you to use them in expressions by just writing their names, and will allow GDevelop to warn you if you misspell a variable - avoiding bugs in your game.
  GDevelop also now support local variables. Those have been designed to be used the events sheet only and should be used as disposable variables, available only inside the event where you add them (and inside the sub-events).
  Finally, extensions now also support variables stored inside them. These variables can live for the duration of the game (in which case they are extension global variables) or of a scene (extension scene variables). Extension creators are encouraged to use them to store data that was previously stored in scene variables.
  💝 Improvements
  🔍 Diagnostic report
  A "diagnostic report" will now be shown when a preview is launched and GDevelop detects problems in your event sheet. It will tell you if there are missing scene variables, object variables or behaviors.
  This is especially useful if you use external events shared between several scenes - in which case a mistake, like forgetting to declare a variable in a scene, can happen without being noticed immediately.
