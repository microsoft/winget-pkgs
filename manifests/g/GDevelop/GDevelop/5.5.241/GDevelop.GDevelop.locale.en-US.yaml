  üíù Improvements
  - All community extensions can now be browsed on this new Community List page. This is a big list of all extensions made by members of the GDevelop community. It's accessible from the GDevelop website top menu and will be added progressively to other repositories.
    - Feel free to suggest links to your own extensions. The GDevelop Extensions Team won't make a review of your extension, but will just ensure it's safe and will add it to the list.
      üëâ You can open an issue or, better, a Pull Request to add your extension with a description and a link to it.
      There is no quality or code criteria to add an extension to the Community List (as long as the extension is safe to use and does not contain malware or illegal content). You're responsible for the quality and maintenance of your extension.
    - Community extensions inside GDevelop have been renamed to "Experimental" extensions. The new name to indicates that they are peer reviewed so that they can progressively be improved, to be possibly moved to the reviewed extensions at some point.
  We hope this new, easily accessible list will help both contributors share their extensions easily and encourage trying new things. Once your extension reaches a point of maturity, feel free to also suggest it to be added as an experimental extension to the GDevelop Extensions repository.
