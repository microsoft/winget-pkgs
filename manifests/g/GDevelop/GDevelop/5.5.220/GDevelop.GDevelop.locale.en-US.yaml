  üéá The GDevelop team and contributors are wishing everyone a warm, joyful festive season and a bright start to the new year!
  üéÅ Introducing 3D Physics (based on Jolt Physics engine)
  GDevelop now provides a powerful 3D Physics engine, allowing to create any kind of 3D games.
  The 3D physics engine is powered by Jolt Physics a modern, performant, battle-tested, fully featured 3D physics engine used in AAA games, like Horizon: Forbidden West. The new 3D physics engine is perfect for making FPS, TPS, 3D platformers and in the future 3D racing games or any 3D game.

  You can try this example of a 3D platformer game that is powered by the new 3D physics engine here and edit it in the app. You can also try the simple 3D FPS example.
  - Adding physics to 3D objects: similar to the 2D physics engine, you can add the 3D Physics behavior to your object. For example, add the behavior to platforms with the type set to "Static".
    - You can choose the collider shape: box, sphere, cylinder or capsule and modify physics properties of the objects having this behavior - much like the 2D physics engine.
  - For 3D characters: a dedicated "3D Physics Character" behavior is available.
    - To actually move, pair it with one or more additional behaviors to get controls working out of the box: "3D Shooter keyboard mapper", "3D Platformer keyboard mapper", etc... Behaviors with support for touch screens, gamepads and keyboard/mouse have all been made and tested.
  Take a look at the new example to give it a try! New examples and behaviors will be progressively added and existing 3D examples will be adapted. The wiki will also be updated in the next weeks with the different behaviors and capabilities provided.

  üßë‚Äçüè´ New premium, chapter-by-chapter course to learn and master GDevelop
  We're releasing a premium course designed to let you learn and master everything you need to know about GDevelop and gamedev. It is available through the Learn tab in GDevelop for accounts having a premium membership. If you don't have a subscription to GDevelop, the 3 first chapters are offered for free and new chapters can also be unlocked individually with credits.

  The course is designed to let you learn by doing and exploring the app. It will have a total of 15 chapters with:
  - Dozens of action-oriented, specific goals to achieve in each chapter, with a full explanation for each, an illustration and an answer to reveal.
  - Exclusive templates created for you to follow each lesson. Open the template, watch the video and start learning each goal one by one.
  - An overall tracking of your progress.
  The course can be followed on your computer or on the go using GDevelop mobile app. New chapters will be added soon!
  üéØ Reworked "Create" tab on the homepage
  The "Build" and "Manage" tabs have been merged into a single, simpler screen. From the Create tab, you can now access the projects you're working on (local projects or cloud projects), as well as manage the games you have published.

  - If you have multiple local or cloud projects linked to a same game, the game will appear once in the list, and the projects will be grouped into it.
  - When you create a new game, it will appear directly in this list. If the game is never saved (for example, you open a template without saving it first), it will be removed once closed and won't clutter this list.
  - Games can be sorted by date of last change or by their popularity (number of sessions).
  - Earnings (revenue sharing from ads on gd.games) are displayed at the top as well as your account total credits.

  üíù Improvements
  - Change scene editor title depending if instance or object edited on mobile
  - Adapt the condition column size in the Events Sheet
    - Also change the default extension editor layout.
  - Merge the function properties and parameters tabs in the extension editor
  - Automatically rename function parameters in events when a parameter is renamed.
  - Add error display for some obvious semantic/type errors in JavaScript code blocks.
  - A better looking invalid/missing texture placeholder, with the GDevelop "G" logo, is now displayed when you create an object without a texture/image set to it.
  üêõ Bug fixes
  - Fix a regression on custom object life-cycle parameters not being locked
  - Fix regression in extensions loading
  - Fix asset store display speed and reduce the burst of requests
  - Fix: Apply z offset to instance even if no z in instance data
  - Fix installing extensions with dependencies from assets
  - Fix title missing in curriculum lessons
  - Fix installing assets with resource kinds like bitmap texts
