  üíù Improvements
  - Allow changing Opacity & Flip directly in Instance Properties Panel
    - This allows playing around with instances directly on the canvas instead of relying on the actions to flip or change opacity and needing to start a preview
  - Custom object layouting support: Instances in a custom object can now use the anchor behavior and, when used in another scene (or another custom object), the custom object will dynamically adapt the position of its instances according to its size.
  - The teacher educational resources list have been updated to show the upcoming lessons we're preparing.
  - Various Tilemap improvements:
    - Improve performance display when painting tiles,
    - Allow atlas size to be something else than a tile size multiple and ignore last column and row,
    - Display error message only when the the tile size is greater than the atlas image,
    - Add object name in actions and conditions.
  üêõ Bug fixes
  - Tilemap fixes:
    - Fix tiles preview when tilemap instance is rotated
    - Do not crash preview if tilemap object badly configured
  - Fix a crash in the new behavior dialog (the crash happened when the extensions didn't load as expected).
  - Fix hot reload of object variables in object instances.
  - Fix store UI (wrong centering of items)
  ‚öôÔ∏è Extensions
  - [Reviewed] [Rolling counter] Smoothly change a counter value of a text object (Thanks @Jurfix!)

  üïπ Premium Game Templates
  - [Cubic world] Fix fonts
