  üìù üèéÔ∏è Objects now directly editable from the Properties panel

  When an object is selected (or when "Edit object" is chosen in the Properties panel after choosing an instance), this panel will now show the object properties, behaviors, variables and effects. Everything can be directly edited from there.
  This allows for fast edition of most elements of an object: appearance, properties, but also behaviors, variables, effects... Most work and iterations on your game should be faster, from adapting the appearance of a text to tweaking behaviors and updating the preview to check the result in realtime. For example, behaviors can be directly added, removed and configured:

  üí° If you keep the preview of the game opened, on the desktop app, you can then click on the "Update" button in the toolbar to apply changes to the live game, without restarting the preview.
  ‚úàÔ∏è Custom objects ("prefabs") can now be created (Experimental)
  Custom objects are containers, composed of one or more other objects and having custom logic (made with events, like in a traditional scene) inside them. In this new version of GDevelop, you can now select a few instances on the scene and extract them into a custom object that will contain them and their associated object:

  "Custom objects" are also called "Prefabs" or "Templates" in some game engines.
  They almost act like if they are a scene, but available as an object. Like custom behaviors, they can have actions, conditions and expressions, so they can be manipulated by the scene events. They allow to speed-up development and make games more modular by having an object that can be reused in different scenes.
  For example, you can build:
  - A custom object that is a dialog: a background, some text, some buttons. This allows to do all the logic related to this dialog inside the custom object events, without cluttering the scene.
  - A character or some other game objects that is composed of multiple parts. For example,
  Read the documentation to learn more about their usage.
  You can see here the two buttons extracted into a custom object. Notice the checkered background indicating that this is not a scene but a custom object that can be reused in multiple scenes:
