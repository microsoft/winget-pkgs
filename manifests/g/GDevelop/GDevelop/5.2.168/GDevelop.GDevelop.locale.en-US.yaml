ReleaseNotes: |-
  💝 Improvements
  - Show extensions from the store at the end of the behavior list, with information about their authors.
  - Improve the effects UI by separating 2D and 3D effects in 2 different lists.
  - Various improvements to the leaderboards and score handling:
  - Leaderboards will now display the score of the player, if a score was just sent before displaying the leaderboard.
  - If the score is being sent, the leaderboard will wait for it to be sent before showing the leaderboard.
  - Important change: a player name can now be empty when a score is sent.
    In this case, the leaderboard will auto-generate a name.
  - Leaderboard administration was improved to allow to customise the prefix used to generate automatically player names (when no name is entered by the player).
    You can also now choose to disallow any custom player name to prevent abuse (in this case, all non-connected player names will be auto-generated)
  - Allow to use custom CSS to fully customize the leaderboard.
    This is only available for business users (reach out if you need this).
