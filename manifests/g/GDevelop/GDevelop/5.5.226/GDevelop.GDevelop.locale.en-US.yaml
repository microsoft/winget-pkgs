  üíù Improvements
  - 3D improvements:
    - Add a Tint color property for the 3D cube object.
    - Add support for crossfading animations for 3D models
      This new option allows to smoothly transition between animations. The fading duration can be customized with an action.
  - Allow anchored objects to be moved from their initial position.
    If an anchored object is moved using events (or another behavior), it will stay on its new position.
    This allows to anchor objects on the left, right, top or bottom of the screen (or inside the bounds of a custom object, for example in a dialog) and still allow them to move.
  - A Pixel Art version is now available for each 2D starting points (Platformer, Top-Down & Physics) when creating a new game project.
  - The Play section was reworked to have games played directly inside the app. Try it notably on the GDevelop app on iOS and Android.
  - Add an action to join a lobby in one-click, to speed up joining a game for a player.
  - Update AdMob extension to handle Consent & Tracking Authorization on iOS.
    - Admob will now initialize 2 seconds after the app loads, giving more control to when it starts. This is particularly helpful for App Store validations, with Tracking Authorization message.
    - New conditions are available to know AdMob initialization status: "AdMob initializing" and "AdMob Initialized".
    - New action to stop the auto-initialization: "Prevent AdMob auto initialization" and new action to trigger the initialization: "Initialize AdMob manually". Typically, you'd prevent the initialization at the beginning of the scene, and trigger it manually when a user interacts with a button or something, so you can control when they'll see the consent messages.
  - Upgrade internal version of PixiJS (WebGL 2D rendering) to 7.4.2.
  - New badge and credits can be unlocked when subscribing to GDevelop's YouTube channel
  - UI improvements:
    - Improve the display of actions/conditions/expressions when searched with a clearer visual separator for their folders
    - Adapt tabs width according to screen width, to keep them visible on screen as much as possible.
    - Prevent installing assets or behaviors from extensions that are incompatible with GDevelop's version.
    - Improve the abs expression documentation.
    - Deprecate internal actions and conditions to set and compare property values in extension events: the unified variable action and condition should be used instead.
    - Allow custom objects to declare multi-line text properties.
    - Do not show the save reminder if the editor was just idle for too long.
    - Add a clearer warning before the deletion of a game and a project, to prevent accidental deletion of games.
    - Improve in-app tutorials, with help messages inside the preview.
    - Add a warning on array children with inconsistent type
    - Update "Create objects from an external layout" action to show all parameters in the events sheet (thanks @AnseloOriginal!)
  üêõ Bug fixes
  - Fix onCreated functions not being called on behaviors added at hot-reload, causing a crash in the preview
  - Fix expression documentation not displaying parameters
  - Fix object parameter not shown when editing an action/condition when the object doesn't exist
  - Fix access to objects in variable expressions of "for each child variable" loops
  - Fix toggle "update game page" sometimes not being visible when publishing.
    - This could happen when the last build was too old, and the interface considered the game as new, so published it automatically to the game page.
  - Fix crash when opening 3D Racing game example external layouts
    - Use default values when updating Cube 3D three object in editor
  - Fix a project opened from a file being always detected as a new game in the dashboard
  - Fix spatial sound action not applied if sound is not playing yet
  - Prevent accidentally saving a project in the root folder of the editor
  - Fix border radius added by browser on text input
  - Add missing keys in keyboard condition/action (Left and Right bracket and the Menu keys)
  - Fix asset images stuck with a loader in the store (Disabling lazy loading on authorized images)
  - [3D character] Fix the "is moving" condition when moving sideways
  - Fix tile set not updated when tilemap resource file is change outside of GDevelop
