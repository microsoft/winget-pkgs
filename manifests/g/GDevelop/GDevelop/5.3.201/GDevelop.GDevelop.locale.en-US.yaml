ReleaseNotes: |-
  ✨ Instance properties panel rework
  The instance properties panel of the scene editor has been reworked into a more compact and user-friendly panel. Read the documentation about this panel to learn everything that it offers.

  💾 Autosave for Cloud projects
  A new autosave feature is automatically enabled for Cloud projects:
  - Cloud projects are now autosaved on each game preview. Should the editor crash, it will help recover your project.
  - The saved project is stored on the device for performance reasons.
  Warning
  If you're using GDevelop online on a public computer, this feature saves a copy of your project in the browser storage. To make sure no one can access it, make sure to log out the editor when you leave the computer.
  💝 Improvements
  - Use new icons for variable parameters in events
  - Improve user profiles by showing games, asset packs and game templates made by the user
    - The app now shows the same profiles as those you can see on gd.games

  - Increase lower toolbars size and padding on mobile
  - Add a field to enter the GitHub username in the user profile
