  ü™ü Separate side panel for "Ask AI"
  The "Ask AI" tab is now shown as a separate pane (or a drawer on small screens):

  This allows you to continue working or easily follow what is done by the AI on the game:

  üíù Improvements
  - Improvements to the "variants" of custom objects:
    - Add a deprecation message for custom objects using old "configuration overriding" (this is replaced by support for "variants")
    - Allow to select a custom object variant in the properties panel
    - Also show a dialog to duplicate a variant before opening them if necessary.
  üêõ Bug fixes
  - Fix the legacy turning back mode for the top-down movement behavior.
  - Various fixes for variants:
    - Forbid to edit the default variant of published extensions
    - Hide the children configuration from the side panel when a variant is used
    - Fix the Z-order of nested custom objects in the editor
    - Fix a memory crash when updating an extension where behaviors must be removed from child-objects
  - Fix selection of face orientation in 3D Cube editor
  - Fix button labels not refreshing when modified from the side panel
  - Fix Send icon color
  ‚öôÔ∏è Extensions
  - [Community] [Chat bubble] Fix the bubble color
  - [Reviewed] [Button] Use anchor behaviors in buttons
  - [Reviewed] [Slider and Toggle] Allow to create variants
  üé® Assets
  - Add a new SFX audio pack: Clean UI Sound Effects by Liminal Creations
  - Migrate the buttons, sliders and switches to variants
  üïπ Examples
  - Use "variants" for buttons, sliders, toggles in all examples
  üïπ Premium Game Templates
  - [Impostor Alert] Bugs fixes & new tileset:
    - Fixed a bug, when the impostor kills everyone it shows DEFEAT screen to everyone including the impostor (now it shows DEFEAT for the crewmates and VICTORY for the impostor).
    - Fixed a bug, if a player has disconnected during the match, and crewmates has finished all their tasks, no victory happens because the disconnected player didn't finish his tasks, (now even if a player has disconnected, the game will auto update its tasks' data to the new number of players currently in the match, and trigger victory when all tasks have finished).
    - Quests bar will auto update if a player has disconnected during the match.
    - Included the game map tileset in the Assets folder, in case the user want to change/update the map.
