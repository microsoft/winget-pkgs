    - A Pro account can access unlimited versions (like previously).
  - Properties and effects of layers are now shown in the side panel when selected. This allows to quickly edit properties, notably effect properties. When the 3D editor is activated, the result are visible in real-time, which is useful to tweak lighting, shadows and other effects. This also work for layer 2D effects!
  See the new properties panel used to modify and visualize lights in the 3D editor:
