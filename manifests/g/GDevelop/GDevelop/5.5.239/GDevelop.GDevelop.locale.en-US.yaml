ReleaseNotes: |-
  üßë‚Äçüè´ New premium courses and "Start Fast" bundle

  A new Bundle to get started with GDevelop is now available: it includes 3 premium courses as well as multiple game templates and asset packs, 4 months of GDevelop Silver and will save you 70% over purchasing these separately.
  We've also published new premium courses made specially for GDevelop:
  - A complete course showing how to make your own 3D GTA-like game: run, drive and shoot zombies,
  - A course about Game Sound Design,
  - A course to master Typography for video games.

  ‚ú® GPT-5 available for testing in the GDevelop AI agent
  Gold and Pro subscribers can now choose to use GPT-5 as the engine for the AI agent. Feel free to try it and share your feedback about how it performs!
  Compared to the default model, it should take more time to inspect the game and go a bit further when asked to build a feature.
  üíù Improvements
  - Add a "line height" property for Text objects.
  - Allow anchors to set the wrapping width of bitmap texts and BBCode texts.
  - Add new StrReplaceOne and StrReplaceAll expressions to replace portions of texts in an expression.
  - Small UI improvements:
    - Add the unit for 3D angle parameter descriptions
    - Add an alert when editing the default variant of an extension from the store
  üêõ Bug fixes
  - Fix cached materials not being cleared when unloading resources
  - Fix the tint action of Sprite to handle floating point color components
  - Fix changing language not reloading courses in this language
  - AI fixes:
    - Fix default light effects not added for scenes created by AI
    - Fix default UI layer position for AI
    - Ensure behaviors used in events generated by AI are automatically added to objects
  - Forbid camera zoom to be set to 0
  - Reduce network requests at startup by lazily loading course chapters when opened
  - Fix Android build and player authentication sometimes not working:
    - Player authentication window could not open if no action/condition related to player authentication was used
    - Fix Android build by using an updated dependency for opening the authentication window
  ‚öôÔ∏è Extensions
  - Update PlaygamaBridge to v1.24.0
  - [Reviewed] [Sticker] Fix a memory leak
  üïπ Premium Game Templates
  - Bug fixes on Impostor Alert:
    - Fixed a bug where you see the impostor venting out while he is getting out of the door (now the impostor will show up only when the door animation (vent out) has finished).
    - Fixed a bug where it shows DEFEAT to all players including the impostor when the crewmates vote against a crewmate and the last 2 players are impostor vs crewmate (now the game ends with VICTORY to impostor and DEFEAT to crewmate).
  üõ† Internal changes (for developers)
  - Add debug flag to GDJS build script (Thanks @malec-palec!)
  - Optimize JavaScript events (avoid a list copy)
