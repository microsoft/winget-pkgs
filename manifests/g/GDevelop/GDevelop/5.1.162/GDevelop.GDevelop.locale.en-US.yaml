  - Watch our full video showing how to use 3D objects on YouTube.
  - You can use a 3D Box object (that can be set up with images for each face of the box) and a 3D Model object to create 3D worlds and levels.

  Reviewed extensions
  - [Advanced Projectile]
  - Controls how a projectile moves including speed, acceleration, distance, and lifetime.
  - [Mouse Pointer Lock]
  - Fixed to return more accurate travel distance.

  - Tracks player interaction with an object, including "hovered", "pressed", and "clicked".
