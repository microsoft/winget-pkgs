  - A racing game
  - A shooting gallery
  - A sokoban like game
  - Watch our full video showing how to use 3D objects on YouTube.
  - You can use a 3D Box object (that can be set up with images for each face of the box) and a 3D Model object to create 3D worlds and levels.
  - You will also find actions to move the camera in the space.
  Efficiency and UX improvements
  - Allow to copy and paste effects from one object (or layer) to another object (or layer)

  Reviewed extensions
  - [Advanced Projectile]
  - Controls how a projectile moves including speed, acceleration, distance, and lifetime.
  - [Mouse Pointer Lock]
  - Fixed to return more accurate travel distance.

    Respect project scale mode.
    The render to sprite extension would always use linear scaling instead of the scale mode set in the project settings, this ensures that the project's scale mode is respected.

  - [Button states] Use any object as a button
  - Tracks player interaction with an object, including "hovered", "pressed", and "clicked".
