ReleaseNotes: |-
  💝 Improvements
  - Prevent saving in the same folder as GDevelop's executable
  - Some users have mentioned their project disappear after a GDevelop's update.
    This is a safe-guard to avoid projects from being saved in the executable folder, as it gets deleted on every update.
  - Rework the asset store to show bundles and owned packs first
  - Also slightly improve the size of dialogs on large screens
  🐛 Bug fixes
  - Fix multiple flaws in collision masks & points management:
  - Adding a new sprite in a new animation will now correctly copy points and collision masks defined in others if "sharing with all animations" is toggled
  - Automatic collision mask will now be automatically applied when adding multiple sprites, or when editing with piskel
  - Collision mask will be applied correctly for new sprites, when the default (full image mask) is set
  - Fix a bug where renaming project elements wouldn't work when an action is using the default layer
