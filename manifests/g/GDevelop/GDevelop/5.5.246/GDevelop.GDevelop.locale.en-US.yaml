  💝 Improvements
  - Various AI improvements:
    - Suggestions are now shown after each relevant step in the AI agent flow,
    - The AI chat design was improved so that it's easier to follow what the AI agent does to the project,
    - AI is now using flexible AI credits to track the consumption:
      - AI credits are given every week to GDevelop accounts with a membership. They allow to make requests to the AI and these AI credits are consumed according to the complexity of the AI answer and the work it's doing.
      - This is more flexible than the previous system of AI requests, which would be consumed even if the answer of the AI was very short. The AI credits adapt better to conversations and back-and-forth between the user and the AI.
      - Accounts without a premium membership still get 40 credits for free every month to try the AI.
  - The default orientation of newly created 3D model objects was changed to face axis X+. This is better adapted to GLTF conventions and GDevelop axes orientation for most 3D games.
  - Extension improvements:
    - When an extension is installed, any extension that it depends on is now automatically installed too.
    - And when an extension is removed, a warning about any dependent extensions is shown.
    - Actions/conditions can now use parameters and properties of type "resource".
  - Various UI improvements:
    - Show object parameters in red if any behavior parameter is wrongly filled,
    - Display a placeholder when the Spine resource is invalid
    - Automatically fill behavior parameters when an object is set
  - Improve panels positioning when opened:
    - Left and right panels now have an equal size by default,
    - Bottom panel is in-between the left and right panels
    - If multiple panels on the right, or bottom, they take half of the size.
    - When closed and re-opened, panels keep their position on the screen.
