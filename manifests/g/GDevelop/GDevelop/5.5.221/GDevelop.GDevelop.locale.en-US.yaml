ReleaseNotes: |-
  üíù Improvements
  - Tooltips have been added on some 3D physics properties, to ease the understanding of the behavior
  - Game feedbacks are now paginated, improving responsiveness of the app
  - When multiple projects are linked to a game, only 3 are now visible in the quick menu to avoid overcrowding the menu, the others are accessible in the game dashboard itself
  - Ensured the Home tab is still shown when a project is opened on small screens (+ improve scroll animation to active tab)
  üêõ Bug fixes
  - Type checking in JavaScipt code block events, which was enabled in the previous version, has been removed until all autocompletions are properly handled. While type checking was enabled to make it easier and less error-prone to write JavaScript code, it was making the editing of JavaScript events too cumbersome (a lot of errors were shown in scripts, with a lot of false positive, diminishing the usefulness of the checking). It will be enabled again later when proper type definitions are available. Note that this does not impact at all how the games or extensions work.
  - Fix the collision conditions for 3D physics characters (migrated to Jolt 0.31.0)
  - Fix asset preview being too zoomed in.
  - Remove logs for audio events when manipulating a sound/music on an unused channel, which was causing the previews to crash due to the log being spammed in the console.
  ‚öôÔ∏è Extensions
  - [Community] [Navigation mesh pathfinding] Fix the rotation speed and declare property units.
  - [Reviewed] Add 13 helper behaviors for 3D characters
  üé® Assets
  - Add a ready-to-use "Two Choices Dialog Box" object
  - Add Survival Building, Watercraft and Trains packs by Kenney
  - Add Zombie Apocalypse, Toon Shooter and Cyberpunk Platform packs from Quaternius
  üïπ Examples
  - Add or adapt examples to use the 3D Physics Engine (3D platformer, 3D first person, 3D shooting gallery).
  üïπ Premium Game Templates
  - Add a new game template: Platform Fighter, a game like Super Smash Bros by VegeTato
