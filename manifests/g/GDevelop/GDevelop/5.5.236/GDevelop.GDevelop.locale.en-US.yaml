ReleaseNotes: |-
  Note for users who tried version 5.5.235 (pre-release version): the elevation and rotation properties of the Directional Light have been updated. You need to update them in your game.
  üï∂Ô∏è Introducing basic support for shadows

  Realistic shadows can now be rendered for 3D objects in your scenes using a Directional Light. By default, all new games and new scene layers now come with both a Directional Light and an Ambient Light. This gives a result similar to sunlight casting shadows in the real world.
  - 3D models and 3D cubes are now casting shadows. To make sure they appear properly:
    - Set the object‚Äôs material to Standard (not Basic, which doesn‚Äôt react to lighting).
    - Make sure Shadow Casting and Shadow Receiving are enabled.
      This is done by default for new objects you create or import from the Asset Store.
  - Shadows are rendered around the camera on an area that is large enough for most games while giving still good quality results. This means they should work out of the box and be adapted to most games, including large maps.
    You can adapt the quality of shadows, intensity of the light (and so shadows), the size of the rendered area by editing the 3D effects of the layer in the scene (as for other effects).
  Note: power users may be interested to look at the new Advanced 3D Features community extension by @PANDAKO-GitHub. This is an unofficial extension but has many effects and features extending the 3D capabilities of GDevelop.

  Shadows in the 3D platformer example.
  Some tweaks and changes to shadow rendering might happen in the next versions according to usability and performance (notably on mobile). For now, only shadows rendered by a unique Directional Light in the scene are supported. 3D lights ("Spotlights") will be added later after ensuring they can be used without risking big performance drops.
  üìö New Premium courses in the "Learn tab"
  Two new premium courses are now available in the "Learn" tab:
  - Make a Platformer Game: learn how to build a modern 2D platformer game step by step. This course walks you through designing two levels with effects like slow motion and screen transitions and gameplay mechanics such as smash and dash. You'll also implement interactive elements (checkpoints, respawn logic...). Each of the 6 chapters includes an exclusive video tutorial and a ready-to-use template.
  - How To Market & Sell Your Game: a complete course explaining what to know about game marketing. Spread the word on social media, attract players, and how to start generating revenue. The course has real-world case studies, actionable tips, and proven strategies to help you grow your community, build momentum, and successfully market your game.
  üü° All these GDevelop-exclusive courses will soon become distinct & unique products, that can be purchased (lifetime access) without a monthly subscription.
  In the meantime, they are accessible for a week for everybody who has a subscription (Silver, Gold or Pro).
  The full GDevelop Master Course, featuring 15 chapters including dozens of tasks and step-by-step answers, will remain available to all subscribers. Thank you for your support!

  üíù Improvements
  - Allow to unload scene resources when a scene is exited (thanks @ViktorVovk!)
    - This adds two new settings, available in the Project Properties and in the Scene Properties dialog, to allow to specify the strategy for preloading resources of the scenes and unloading them. By default, a game will preload in background the resources of all scenes. It will never unload these resources (so scene switching is fast).
    - You can now choose to unload the resources of a scene when the scene is left using the "Resources unloading" field. If the scene is launched again later, it will load its resources again.
    - You can also choose to change the preloading to disable it for all scenes (by modifying the setting in the project properties) or enable it/disable it on a scene by scene basis. This can be useful for large or modular games where you anticipate the player to only play some scenes, or if you want to reduce the resources that needs to be loaded on a web game.
  - Add user friendly labels to selector fields in object and effect properties.
  - [Platformer] Fix wrongly allowed double jump when jumping from a slope.
  - Show an highlight on newly generated AI events to make it easier to find them
  üêõ Bug fixes
  - Update "Pick all instances" to avoid crashes when a lot of objects are picked (thanks @arthuro555!)
  - Fix resource selector text color on light theme
  - Fix a crash when using the "Fixed rotation" action on a 3D character
  - Fix "Wheel offset Z" and "Front wheel drive" properties of the 3D car behavior
  - Fix missing MassCenterZ expression for the 3D physics behavior
  New in 5.5.236:
  - Fix directional light orientation and missing settings in the 3D cube editor
  - Fix hot-reloading of custom objects
  - Fix custom objects being destroyed too soon
  ‚öôÔ∏è Extensions
  - [Community] [Advanced 3D Features] Provides advanced features for augmenting the 3D capabilities of GDevelop - thanks @PANDAKO-GitHub!
  - Add condition for checking Panel Sprite Button label text
  - Update "Get user session data" expression in CrazyGamesAdApi to get and return a String
  New in 5.5.236:
  - [Reviewed] [3D particles] Fix a crash when there is no animation nor frame
  - [Reviewed] [Advanced platformer movements] Allow to force the dash direction by simulating left or right key
  üïπ Examples
  - Added shadow on 3D starter games and "3D car coin hunt" example.
  - Fixed the road physics shape Z offset in "3D car coin hunt".
  üïπ Premium Game Templates
  - Fix RTS template assets (thanks @VegeTato!)
