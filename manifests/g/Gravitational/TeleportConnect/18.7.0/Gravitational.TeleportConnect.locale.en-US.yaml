ReleaseNotes: |-
  Session timeline view for Identity Security
  Session player for Identity Security users received an enhanced timeline view with
  per-command session breakdown.
  Organization-level auto-discovery for AWS EC2 instances
  AWS auto-discovery supports EC2 instance enrollment from all or a subset of accounts
  of an AWS organization without having to configure per-account discovery.
  Organization-level discovery for other resources within AWS (RDS, EKS) as well as other
  for cloud providers will follow in future releases.
  Terraform-native flow for configuration of AWS EC2 auto-discovery
  Teleport provides in-product UX for configuring EC2 auto-discovery in a single AWS
  account using terraform module.
  Static labels for auto-discovered Windows desktops
  Teleport can now be configured to apply a set of static labels to Windows
  desktops that it discovers via LDAP. This is an alternative to setting labels
  based on the value of LDAP attributes.
  Access requests privilege escalation UX for AWS
  Teleport users are now able to see specific IAM roles available to them when requesting
  elevated access to AWS CLI/console. Future releases will extend support for specific
  principal selection to access requests for other resource types as well.
  Entra ID integration status page
  Teleport users are now able to see status of the configured Entra ID integration in the
  web UI.
  Inventory UI
  Teleport's web UI now includes a new page showing the complete inventory of all instances
  and bots connected to the cluster.
  Managed Updates UI
  Teleport's web UI now includes new functionality for working with managed updates.
  The UI offers the ability to view and manage the updater configuration as well
  as monitor the progress of update rollouts.
  Split Windows CA
  Teleport now introduces a new Windows CA responsible for issuing user certificates for
  Windows Desktop access. Currently the User CA issues those certificates, as they are end-user certs.
  Splitting the CAs improves Teleport's security posture by introducing a more specialized CA
  and allows both CAs to be rotated independently.
  Other fixes and improvements
  - Fixed tsh kubectl failing when kubectl flags appear before positional arguments (e.g., tsh kubectl -n default get pod). #63807
  - The tsh status command can now be executed in client-only mode with --client. This skips all server-side operations. #63786
  - Improved tracing support via tsh --trace kubectl. #63762
  - Added tctl recordings download command to download session recordings to local files without requiring direct access to the storage backend. #63726
  - MWI: Add new tbot start no-op helper that starts no services. #63666
  - Improved performance and user experience of teleport backend clone. #63635
  - Fixed out of sequent audit logs rendering in ui for same timestamp logs. #63613
  - Added the Windows CA, used to issue Windows Desktop Access user certificates. The Windows CA is initially created as a copy of the User CA, so existing trust relationships are maintained. You may rotate either CA in order to create distinct key material (make sure to consult the Certificate Authority Rotation guide before performing a CA rotation). The Windows CA is a top-level CA entity, so it is reflected in all commands that operate on CAs. Updating both command-line tools and Windows Desktop agents is recommended. #63547
  - Added support for summarizer resources to the Teleport Terraform provider. #63534
  - Add Managed Updates dashboard to the WebUI. #63310
  - Fixed a bug that could cause Windows desktops discovered via LDAP to be removed in error. #62471
  - Fixed an issue that could cause failed Active Directory user lookups to cache the error rather than retry. #62471
  - Ensure that discovered Windows desktops don't expire when a large discovery interval is configured. #62471
  - Each Windows desktop discovery_config can now include a set of static labels to apply to discovered hosts. #62452
  - Added support for discovering EC2 instances in all the accounts under an AWS Organization. #62302
  - Added support for EC2 instances to join based on their AWS Organization. #62302
  Enterprise:
  - Updated Entra ID plugin UI to support Access List owners source configuration.
  - Fixes a panic that occurred when External Audit Storage was available but not enabled in Teleport Cloud while Access Monitoring was enabled.
  - Added plugin status page for Teleport Entra ID integration.
