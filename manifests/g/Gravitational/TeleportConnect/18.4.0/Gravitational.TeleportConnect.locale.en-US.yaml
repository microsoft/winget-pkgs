ReleaseNotes: |-
  Streamable-HTTP and SSE support for MCP Zero-Trust Access
  MCP Zero-Trust Access users are now able to secure and audit connections to MCP servers that use HTTP-based transport protocols in addition to stdio.
  Improved Bot Instances Dashboard
  The Bot Instances dashboard now provides a more intuitive interface for managing a fleet of Machine & Workload Identity bot instances. This includes improved filtering, sorting and searching capabilities, and a high-level overview of the versions of all bot instances in the cluster.
  Updated Oracle Joining Support
  Oracle compute instances are no longer required to have additional IAM permissions granted to them in order to join. Oracle join tokens now also allow restricting which instances may leverage a token to join.
