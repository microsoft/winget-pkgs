  Other changes and improvements
  - Improved observability by adding health check metrics for healthy, unhealthy, and unknown states. Database health checks can now be monitored with these metrics. #58708
  - Removed AccessList review notification check from tsh login/status flow. #58662
  - Lock, unlock and delete from the Bot Details page, as well as viewing lock status. #58653

  - Fixed panic in tbot's ssh-multiplexer service. #58595
  - Teleport now honours Entra ID OIDC groups overage claim. The OIDC connector spec in Teleport must be updated to request OIDC profile scope and the enterprise application in Entra ID must be granted with User.ReadBasic.All Graph API permission for this feature to work.

This behaviour can be updated by configuring entra_id_groups_provider configuration field, which is available in the OIDC connector configuration spec. #58593
