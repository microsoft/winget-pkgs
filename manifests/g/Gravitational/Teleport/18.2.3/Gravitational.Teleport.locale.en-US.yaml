ShortDescription: Teleport provides connectivity, authentication, access controls and audit for infrastructure.
Description: |-
  Teleport includes an identity-aware access proxy, a CA that issues short-lived certificates, a unified access control system and a tunneling system to access resources behind the firewall.
  We have implemented Teleport as a single Go binary that integrates with multiple protocols and cloud services:
  - SSH nodes.
  - Kubernetes clusters
  - PostgreSQL, MongoDB, CockroachDB and MySQL databases.
  - Internal Web apps.
  - Windows Hosts.
  - Networked servers.
  You can set up Teleport as a Linux daemon or a Kubernetes deployment.
  Teleport focuses on best practices for infrastructure security:
  - No need to manage shared secrets such as SSH keys or Kubernetes tokens: it uses certificate-based auth with certificate expiration for all protocols.
  - Two-factor authentication (2FA) for everything.
  - Collaboratively troubleshoot issues through session sharing.
  - Single sign-on (SSO) for everything via GitHub Auth, OpenID Connect, or SAML with endpoints like Okta or Microsoft Entra ID.
  - Infrastructure introspection: Use Teleport via the CLI or Web UI to view the status of every SSH node, database instance, Kubernetes cluster, or internal web app.
  Teleport uses Go crypto. It is fully compatible with OpenSSH, sshd servers, and ssh clients, Kubernetes clusters and more.
ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Fixed auto-approvals in the Datadog Incident Management integration by updating the on-call API client. #59668
  - Fixed auto-approvals in the Datadog Incident Management integration to ignore case sensitivity in user emails. #59668
  - Database recordings now show the session summary if it is available. #59634
  - Added automatic @<project-id>.iam suffix to GCP Postgres usernames (Teleport Connect). #59629
  - Fixed tsh play not returning an error when playing a session fails. #59625
  - Fixed an issue in Teleport Connect where clicking 'Restart' to apply an update could close the window without actually restarting the app. #59592
  - Added automatic @<project-id>.iam suffix to GCP Postgres usernames (tsh, web UI). #59590
  - Introduced application-proxy service to tbot for HTTP proxying to applications protected by Teleport. #59587
  - MWI: Added support for customizing cluster names with a template to the kubernetes/argo-cd output. #59575
  - Fixed persistence of metadata.description field for the Bot resource. #59570
  - Fixed a crash in Teleport's Windows Desktop Service introduced in 18.2.0. Compaction of certain shared directory read/write audit events could result in a stack overflow error. #59515
  - Added tctl tokens configure-kube helper command to easily trust Kubernetes clusters and allow secure repeatable joining. #59497
  - Made the check for a running Teleport process in the install-node.sh script more robust. #59496
  - Fixed tctl edit producing an error when trying to modify a Bot resource. #59480
  - Added support for generating VSCode and Claude Code MCP servers configurations to the tsh mcp config and tsh mcp db config commands. #59473
  - Fixed a bug where session IDs were tied to the client connection, resulting in issues when combined with multiplexed connection features (OpenSSH ControlPath/ControlMaster/ControlPersist). #59472
  - Improved app access error messages in case of network error. #59468
  - Fixed database IAM configurator potentially getting stuck and never recovering (#59290). #59417
  - Added tbot copy-binaries command to simplify using tbot as a Kubernetes sidecar. #59404
  - Fixed tsh config binary path after managed updates. #59384
  - Updated Entra ID integration to support group filters. #59378
  - Fixed regression allowing SAML apps to be included when filtering resources by 'Applications' in the Web UI. #59327
  - Allow controlling the description of auto-discovered Kubernetes apps with an annotation. #58817
