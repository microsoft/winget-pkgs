ShortDescription: Teleport provides connectivity, authentication, access controls and audit for infrastructure.
Description: |-
  Teleport includes an identity-aware access proxy, a CA that issues short-lived certificates, a unified access control system and a tunneling system to access resources behind the firewall.
  We have implemented Teleport as a single Go binary that integrates with multiple protocols and cloud services:
  - SSH nodes.
  - Kubernetes clusters
  - PostgreSQL, MongoDB, CockroachDB and MySQL databases.
  - Internal Web apps.
  - Windows Hosts.
  - Networked servers.
  You can set up Teleport as a Linux daemon or a Kubernetes deployment.
  Teleport focuses on best practices for infrastructure security:
  - No need to manage shared secrets such as SSH keys or Kubernetes tokens: it uses certificate-based auth with certificate expiration for all protocols.
  - Two-factor authentication (2FA) for everything.
  - Collaboratively troubleshoot issues through session sharing.
  - Single sign-on (SSO) for everything via GitHub Auth, OpenID Connect, or SAML with endpoints like Okta or Microsoft Entra ID.
  - Infrastructure introspection: Use Teleport via the CLI or Web UI to view the status of every SSH node, database instance, Kubernetes cluster, or internal web app.
  Teleport uses Go crypto. It is fully compatible with OpenSSH, sshd servers, and ssh clients, Kubernetes clusters and more.
ReleaseNotes: |-
  Kubernetes support for Relay Service
  The relay service now facilitates Kubernetes connections.
  Shared state between tsh and Teleport Connect
  Teleport Connect and tsh now share the same local state. Logins from one app will automatically be reflected in the other.
  SCIM PATCH support in SailPoint integration
  Teleport SCIM server now natively supports PATCH operations to improve reliability of bulk SCIM operations in integrations like SailPoint.
  Other changes and improvements
  - Updated Go to 1.24.11. #61953
  - Added support for discovering EC2 instances in all regions, without enumerating them. Requires access to account.ListRegions in the IAM Role assumed by the Discovery Service. #61924
  - Fixed a bug where JWT-SVID timestamp claims would be represented using scientific notation. #61921
  - Fixed "SSH cert not found" errors in Teleport Connect. #61846
  - Added support for authenticating Azure resource discovery using Azure OIDC integrations. #61830
  - Fixed a bug in Proxy recording mode where Teleport Node sessions would result in duplicate audit events with a different session ID. #61246
  - Tuned teleport-cluster, teleport-kube-agent, and teleport-relay Helm charts to reduce the probability of Teleport exceeding its memory limits and being OOM-Killed. GOMEMLIMIT defaults to 90% of the configured memory limits.
  Enterprise:
  - Added support for AWS Account name and ID labels (teleport.dev/account-id, teleport.dev/account-name) on AWS Identity Center resources (aws_ic_account_assignment and aws_ic_account). These labels improve compatibility with Access Monitoring Rules, allowing users to more easily target and audit AWS IC accounts.
  - Updated the Access Automation Rules dialog to display rules in a paginated view.
