ShortDescription: Teleport provides connectivity, authentication, access controls and audit for infrastructure.
Description: |-
  Teleport includes an identity-aware access proxy, a CA that issues short-lived certificates, a unified access control system and a tunneling system to access resources behind the firewall.
  We have implemented Teleport as a single Go binary that integrates with multiple protocols and cloud services:
  - SSH nodes.
  - Kubernetes clusters
  - PostgreSQL, MongoDB, CockroachDB and MySQL databases.
  - Internal Web apps.
  - Windows Hosts.
  - Networked servers.
  You can set up Teleport as a Linux daemon or a Kubernetes deployment.
  Teleport focuses on best practices for infrastructure security:
  - No need to manage shared secrets such as SSH keys or Kubernetes tokens: it uses certificate-based auth with certificate expiration for all protocols.
  - Two-factor authentication (2FA) for everything.
  - Collaboratively troubleshoot issues through session sharing.
  - Single sign-on (SSO) for everything via GitHub Auth, OpenID Connect, or SAML with endpoints like Okta or Microsoft Entra ID.
  - Infrastructure introspection: Use Teleport via the CLI or Web UI to view the status of every SSH node, database instance, Kubernetes cluster, or internal web app.
  Teleport uses Go crypto. It is fully compatible with OpenSSH, sshd servers, and ssh clients, Kubernetes clusters and more.
ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Fix AWS CLI access using AWS OIDC integration. #57977
  - Fixed an issue that could cause revocation checks to fail in Windows environments. #57880

  - Fixed connection issues to Windows Desktop Services (v17 or earlier) in Teleport Connect. #57842
  - The teleport-kube-agent Helm chart now supports kubernetes joining. teleportClusterName must be set to enable the feature. #57824
  - Fixed the web UI's access request submission panel getting stuck when scrolling down the page. #57797
  - Enroll new Kubernetes agents in Managed Updates. #57784
  - Teleport now supports displaying more than 2k tokens. #57772
  - Updated Go to 1.24.6. #57764
  - Database MCP server now supports CockroachDB databases. #57762
  - Added support for CockroachDB Web Access and interactive CockroachDB session playback. #57762
  - Added the --auth flag to the tctl plugins install scim CLI command to support Bearer token and OAuth authentication methods. #57759
  - Fix Alt+Click not being registered in remote desktop sessions. #57757
  - Kubernetes Access: kubectl port-forward now exits cleanly when backend pods are removed. #57738
  - Kubernetes Access: Fixed a bug when forwarding multiple ports to a single pod. #57736
  - Fixed unlink-package during upgrade/downgrade. #57720
  - Add new oidc joining mode for Kubernetes delegated joining to support providers that can be configured to provide public OIDC endpoints, like EKS, AKS, and GKE. #57683
  - Teleport event-handler now accepts HTTP Status Code 204 from the recipient. This adds support for sending events to Grafana Alloy and newer Fluentd versions. #57680

  - Allow the use of ResourceGroupsTaggingApi for KMS Key deletion. #57671
  - Added --force option to tctl workload-identity x509-issuer-overrides sign-csrs to allow displaying the output of partial failures, intended for use in clusters that make use of HSMs. #57662
  - Tctl top can now display raw prometheus metrics. #57632
  - Enable resource label conditions for notification routing rules. #57616
  - Use the bot details page to view and edit bot configuration, and see active instances with their upgrade status. #57542
  - Device Trust: added required-for-humans mode to allow bots to run on unenrolled devices, while enforcing checks for human users. #57222
  - Add TeleportDatabaseV3 support to the Teleport Kubernetes Operator. #56948
  - Add TeleportAppV3 support to the Teleport Kubernetes Operator. #56948
  - Fix TELEPORT_SESSION and SSH_SESSION_ID environmental variables not matching in an SSH session. #55272
  Enterprise:
