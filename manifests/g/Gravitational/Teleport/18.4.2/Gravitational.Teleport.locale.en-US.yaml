ShortDescription: Teleport provides connectivity, authentication, access controls and audit for infrastructure.
Description: |-
  Teleport includes an identity-aware access proxy, a CA that issues short-lived certificates, a unified access control system and a tunneling system to access resources behind the firewall.
  We have implemented Teleport as a single Go binary that integrates with multiple protocols and cloud services:
  - SSH nodes.
  - Kubernetes clusters
  - PostgreSQL, MongoDB, CockroachDB and MySQL databases.
  - Internal Web apps.
  - Windows Hosts.
  - Networked servers.
  You can set up Teleport as a Linux daemon or a Kubernetes deployment.
  Teleport focuses on best practices for infrastructure security:
  - No need to manage shared secrets such as SSH keys or Kubernetes tokens: it uses certificate-based auth with certificate expiration for all protocols.
  - Two-factor authentication (2FA) for everything.
  - Collaboratively troubleshoot issues through session sharing.
  - Single sign-on (SSO) for everything via GitHub Auth, OpenID Connect, or SAML with endpoints like Okta or Microsoft Entra ID.
  - Infrastructure introspection: Use Teleport via the CLI or Web UI to view the status of every SSH node, database instance, Kubernetes cluster, or internal web app.
  Teleport uses Go crypto. It is fully compatible with OpenSSH, sshd servers, and ssh clients, Kubernetes clusters and more.
ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Fixed a bug causing high memory consumption in the Teleport Auth Service when clients were listing large resources. #61849
  - Prevent data races when terminating interactive Kubernetes sessions. #61818
  - Fixed tsh db connect failing to connect to databases using separate ports configuration (non-TLS routing mode). #61812
  - Fixed a bug where Kubernetes App Discovery poll_interval is not set correctly. #61791
  - Fixed an issue that caused a failed upload of an encrypted session recording to block other recordings from uploading. #61774
  - Fixed relative path evaluation for SFTP in proxy recording mode. #61760
  - Fixed tsh kube ls showing deleted clusters. #61742
  - Fixed workload identity templating to support certain numeric values that previously gave a "expression did not evaluate to a string" error. #61738
  - Added User Details view to Web UI. #61737
  - Added --roles flag for tsh request search, allowing users to list all requestable roles. This flag is mutually exclusive with --kind. #61699
  - Fixed EC2 SSM Document set up script used in Enroll New Resource. #61673
  - Fixed AWS Console access when using AWS IAM Roles Anywhere or AWS OIDC integrations, when IP Pinning is enabled. #61654
  - Fixed "invalid name syntax" connection error for PostgreSQL auto-provisioned users with email usernames. #61631
  - Auth readiness tuned to wait for cache initialization. #61620
  - Added ability to update existing Azure OIDC integration with tctl. #61592
  Enterprise:
  - Added Entra directory sync metrics.
  - Improved the initial EntraID user and group synchronization time, reducing the time required for the first full sync.
  - Prevented Trivy from reporting false positives when scanning the Teleport binaries.
