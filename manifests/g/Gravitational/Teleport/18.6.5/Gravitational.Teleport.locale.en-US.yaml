ShortDescription: Teleport provides connectivity, authentication, access controls and audit for infrastructure.
Description: |-
  Teleport includes an identity-aware access proxy, a CA that issues short-lived certificates, a unified access control system and a tunneling system to access resources behind the firewall.
  We have implemented Teleport as a single Go binary that integrates with multiple protocols and cloud services:
  - SSH nodes.
  - Kubernetes clusters
  - PostgreSQL, MongoDB, CockroachDB and MySQL databases.
  - Internal Web apps.
  - Windows Hosts.
  - Networked servers.
  You can set up Teleport as a Linux daemon or a Kubernetes deployment.
  Teleport focuses on best practices for infrastructure security:
  - No need to manage shared secrets such as SSH keys or Kubernetes tokens: it uses certificate-based auth with certificate expiration for all protocols.
  - Two-factor authentication (2FA) for everything.
  - Collaboratively troubleshoot issues through session sharing.
  - Single sign-on (SSO) for everything via GitHub Auth, OpenID Connect, or SAML with endpoints like Okta or Microsoft Entra ID.
  - Infrastructure introspection: Use Teleport via the CLI or Web UI to view the status of every SSH node, database instance, Kubernetes cluster, or internal web app.
  Teleport uses Go crypto. It is fully compatible with OpenSSH, sshd servers, and ssh clients, Kubernetes clusters and more.
ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Fixed a CredentialContainer error when attempting to log in to the Web UI with a hardware key using Firefox >=147.0.2. #63245
  - Added support for deleting cluster alerts via tctl alerts rm <alertID> command. #63211
  - Updated OpenSSL to 3.0.19. #63202
  - Added support for injecting Teleport-issued ID tokens into outgoing MCP requests, enabling integrations with MCP servers such as the AWS Bedrock AgentCore MCP Gateway that can validate tokens via OIDC discovery URL. #63156
  - Export "additional_trusted_keys" when exporting TLS CAs, which includes new certificates generated in the "init" rotation phase. Reflected in "tctl auth export" and the "/webapi/auth/export" endpoint. #63134
  - Updated indirect dependency go-chi/chi/v5 (addresses GO-2026-4316). #63092
  - The tbot systemd install command now supports a --pid-file flag for setting the path to the PID file. #63039
  - Allow kubeconfig and context to be explicitly configured for tbot kubernetes_secret destination. #63037
  - Implemented "tctl get cert_authority/catype", in addition to the already existing "tctl get cert_authority" and "tctl get cert_authority/catype/domain". #63027
  - Added a Terraform module to configure Teleport and AWS for EC2 discovery in an AWS account. #63004
  - Added opt-in support to bootstrap the teleport-plugin-event-handler helm chart with MWI to auto-join Teleport clusters when Operator is enabled. #63001
  - Added permissions to the editor role allowing users to view autoupdate agent reports. #62973
  - Improved performance of large search queries for DynamoDB event backend. #62890
  - Introduced tbot-spiffe-daemon-set helm chart for deploying a Daemon Set of tbot agents which serve SPIFFE SVIDs to Kubernetes pods via the SPIFFE Workload API. #62583
  Enterprise:
  - Fixed an issue with the legacy Azure OIDC IdP SSO issuer=sts.windows.net where Teleport was unable to map Teleport roles from the groups claim available in the id_token.
  - Added updated resources to SCIM audit events that create or change SCIM resources.
  - Support multi-arch lock file population for the terraform provider.
  - Added audit events to SCIM PATCH operations.
  - Updated Entra ID plugin to support importing Entra ID group owners as Access List owners.
  - Replaced enterprise downloads list view in Web UI with links to Public Downloads page.
