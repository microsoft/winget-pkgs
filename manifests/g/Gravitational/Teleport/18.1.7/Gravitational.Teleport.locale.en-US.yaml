ShortDescription: Teleport provides connectivity, authentication, access controls and audit for infrastructure.
Description: |-
  Teleport includes an identity-aware access proxy, a CA that issues short-lived certificates, a unified access control system and a tunneling system to access resources behind the firewall.
  We have implemented Teleport as a single Go binary that integrates with multiple protocols and cloud services:
  - SSH nodes.
  - Kubernetes clusters
  - PostgreSQL, MongoDB, CockroachDB and MySQL databases.
  - Internal Web apps.
  - Windows Hosts.
  - Networked servers.
  You can set up Teleport as a Linux daemon or a Kubernetes deployment.
  Teleport focuses on best practices for infrastructure security:
  - No need to manage shared secrets such as SSH keys or Kubernetes tokens: it uses certificate-based auth with certificate expiration for all protocols.
  - Two-factor authentication (2FA) for everything.
  - Collaboratively troubleshoot issues through session sharing.
  - Single sign-on (SSO) for everything via GitHub Auth, OpenID Connect, or SAML with endpoints like Okta or Microsoft Entra ID.
  - Infrastructure introspection: Use Teleport via the CLI or Web UI to view the status of every SSH node, database instance, Kubernetes cluster, or internal web app.
  Teleport uses Go crypto. It is fully compatible with OpenSSH, sshd servers, and ssh clients, Kubernetes clusters and more.
ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Fixed an issue where VNet could not start because of "VNet is already running" error. #58388
  - Fix MCP icon displaying as white/black blocks. #58347
  - Fix crash when running 'teleport backend clone' on non-Linux platforms. #58332
  - Disabled MySQL database health checks to avoid MySQL blocking the Teleport Database Service for too many connection errors. MySQL health checks can be re-enabled by setting max_connect_errors on MySQL to its maximum value and setting the environment variable TELEPORT_ENABLE_MYSQL_DB_HEALTH_CHECKS=1 on the Teleport Database Service instance. #58331
  - Fixed incorrect scp exit status between OpenSSH clients and servers. #58327
  - Fixed sftp readdir failing due to broken symlinks. #58320
  - Added "MCP Servers" filter in resources view for Web UI and Teleport Connect. #58309
  - Enable separate request_object_mode setting for MFA flow in OIDC connectors. #58281
  - Allow a namespace to be specified for the tbot Kubernetes Secret destination. #58203
  - MWI: tbot now supports managing Argo CD clusters via the kubernetes/argo-cd output service. #58200
  - Fixed failure to close user accounting session. #58163
  - Add paginated API ListDatabases, deprecate GetDatabases. #58105
  - Prevent modifier keys from getting stuck during remote desktop sessions. #58103
  - Fixed AWS app access signature verification for AWS requests that use an unsigned payload. #58085
  - Windows desktop LDAP discovery now auto-populates the resource's description field. #58082
  Enterprise:
  - For OIDC SSO, the IdP app/client configured for MFA checks is no longer expected to return claims that map to Teleport roles. Valid claim to role mappings are only required for login flows.
  - Fix SSO MFA method for applications when Teleport is the SAML identity provider and Per-Session MFA is enabled.
  - Added an optional session recording summarizer that uses OpenAI or a compatible API.
