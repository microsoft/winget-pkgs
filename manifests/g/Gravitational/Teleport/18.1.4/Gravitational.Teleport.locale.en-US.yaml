ShortDescription: Teleport provides connectivity, authentication, access controls and audit for infrastructure.
Description: |-
  Teleport includes an identity-aware access proxy, a CA that issues short-lived certificates, a unified access control system and a tunneling system to access resources behind the firewall.
  We have implemented Teleport as a single Go binary that integrates with multiple protocols and cloud services:
  - SSH nodes.
  - Kubernetes clusters
  - PostgreSQL, MongoDB, CockroachDB and MySQL databases.
  - Internal Web apps.
  - Windows Hosts.
  - Networked servers.
  You can set up Teleport as a Linux daemon or a Kubernetes deployment.
  Teleport focuses on best practices for infrastructure security:
  - No need to manage shared secrets such as SSH keys or Kubernetes tokens: it uses certificate-based auth with certificate expiration for all protocols.
  - Two-factor authentication (2FA) for everything.
  - Collaboratively troubleshoot issues through session sharing.
  - Single sign-on (SSO) for everything via GitHub Auth, OpenID Connect, or SAML with endpoints like Okta or Microsoft Entra ID.
  - Infrastructure introspection: Use Teleport via the CLI or Web UI to view the status of every SSH node, database instance, Kubernetes cluster, or internal web app.
  Teleport uses Go crypto. It is fully compatible with OpenSSH, sshd servers, and ssh clients, Kubernetes clusters and more.
