ShortDescription: Teleport provides connectivity, authentication, access controls and audit for infrastructure.
Description: |-
  Teleport includes an identity-aware access proxy, a CA that issues short-lived certificates, a unified access control system and a tunneling system to access resources behind the firewall.
  We have implemented Teleport as a single Go binary that integrates with multiple protocols and cloud services:
  - SSH nodes.
  - Kubernetes clusters
  - PostgreSQL, MongoDB, CockroachDB and MySQL databases.
  - Internal Web apps.
  - Windows Hosts.
  - Networked servers.
  You can set up Teleport as a Linux daemon or a Kubernetes deployment.
  Teleport focuses on best practices for infrastructure security:
  - No need to manage shared secrets such as SSH keys or Kubernetes tokens: it uses certificate-based auth with certificate expiration for all protocols.
  - Two-factor authentication (2FA) for everything.
  - Collaboratively troubleshoot issues through session sharing.
  - Single sign-on (SSO) for everything via GitHub Auth, OpenID Connect, or SAML with endpoints like Okta or Microsoft Entra ID.
  - Infrastructure introspection: Use Teleport via the CLI or Web UI to view the status of every SSH node, database instance, Kubernetes cluster, or internal web app.
  Teleport uses Go crypto. It is fully compatible with OpenSSH, sshd servers, and ssh clients, Kubernetes clusters and more.
ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Fixed Teleport instances running the Auth Service sometimes not becoming ready during initialization. #62194
  - Fixed an Auth Service bug causing the event handler to miss up to 1 event every 5 minutes when storing audit events in S3. #62150
  - Fixed bug where event handler dies on malformed session events. #62141
  - Updated event handler to ingest missing session recordings at twice the concurrency instead of only 10 sessions at a time. #62141
  - Changed "tsh --mfa-mode=cross-platform" to favor security keys on current Windows versions. #62134
  - Fixed "the client connection is closing" error happening under certain conditions in Teleport Connect when connecting to resources with per-session MFA enabled. #62127
  - Improved detail of error messages for identity service in tbot. #62120
  - Teleport Connect now supports expanding ~/ home-directory paths in the configuration file. #62104
  - Added support for --format flag for tsh request search. #62099
  - Fixed bug where event handler types filter is ignored for Teleport clients using Athena storage backend. #62082
  - Fixed intermittent issues with VNet on Windows when other NRPT rules from GPOs are present under HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\DNSClient\DnsPolicyConfig. #62052
  - Added Terraform provider support for teleport_integration resources. #62040
  - DiscoveryConfig resources can now be managed via the Teleport Terraform Provider. #62034
  - Reduced memory consumption of the Application service. #62014
  - Added support for listing application session recordings in tsh recording ls and the Web UI. #62010
  - Fixed a Web UI issue where the copy button for the session ID did not work for non-interactive session recordings. #62010
  - Prevented stuck teleport-cluster Helm chart rollouts in small Kubernetes clusters. Removed resource requests from configuration check hooks. #62003
  - Fixed static keypair creation in tbot keypair create when the --static-key-path flag is used. #61947
  - Re-enabled MySQL database health checks. MySQL health checks will now authenticate to the database as a user, rather than TCP dialing and closing the connection, to prevent MySQL from automatically blocking the Teleport database service instance host. The health check user name default is "teleport-healthchecker". #61942
  - Added support for templating secret_labels, and the {{.Labels}} template variable, to tbot's kubernetes/argo-cd output. #61876
  Enterprise:
  - Updated AWS Identity Center integration sign-in start URL format to support AWS GovCloud accounts.
  - Fix a potential race where Okta assignments may never be cleaned up if the Okta integration is down while the assignment expires.
  - Created a dedicated Access Automations feature page within the Web UI.
  - Entra ID directory reconciler now overwrites user accounts created by the referenced SAML Auth Connector.
