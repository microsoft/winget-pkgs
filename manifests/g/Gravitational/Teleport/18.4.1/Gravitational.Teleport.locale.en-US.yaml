ShortDescription: Teleport provides connectivity, authentication, access controls and audit for infrastructure.
Description: |-
  Teleport includes an identity-aware access proxy, a CA that issues short-lived certificates, a unified access control system and a tunneling system to access resources behind the firewall.
  We have implemented Teleport as a single Go binary that integrates with multiple protocols and cloud services:
  - SSH nodes.
  - Kubernetes clusters
  - PostgreSQL, MongoDB, CockroachDB and MySQL databases.
  - Internal Web apps.
  - Windows Hosts.
  - Networked servers.
  You can set up Teleport as a Linux daemon or a Kubernetes deployment.
  Teleport focuses on best practices for infrastructure security:
  - No need to manage shared secrets such as SSH keys or Kubernetes tokens: it uses certificate-based auth with certificate expiration for all protocols.
  - Two-factor authentication (2FA) for everything.
  - Collaboratively troubleshoot issues through session sharing.
  - Single sign-on (SSO) for everything via GitHub Auth, OpenID Connect, or SAML with endpoints like Okta or Microsoft Entra ID.
  - Infrastructure introspection: Use Teleport via the CLI or Web UI to view the status of every SSH node, database instance, Kubernetes cluster, or internal web app.
  Teleport uses Go crypto. It is fully compatible with OpenSSH, sshd servers, and ssh clients, Kubernetes clusters and more.
ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Fixed a bug that prevented searching audit log events in the web UI when using Athena audit storage. #61603
  - Prevented Trivy from reporting false positives when scanning the Teleport binaries. #61539
  - Added support for tsh logout --proxy (or TELEPORT_PROXY set) to work without --user flag when one identity exists. #61404
  - Fixed web upload/download failure behind load balancers when web listen address is unspecified. #61393
  - Fixed corrupted private keys breaking tsh. #61388
  - Resource names are now properly validated for AWS Roles Anywhere integration Generate Command. #61385
  - Added caches to reduce Active Directory user SID lookups and TLS certificate requests. #61317
  - GOAWAY errors received from Kubernetes API Servers configured with a non-zero --goaway-chance are now forward to clients to be retried. #61256
  - Added support for creating and managing scoped tokens using tctl scoped tokens add/ls/rm. SSH nodes can now join a cluster within a particular scope by joining with a scoped token. #60758
  Enterprise:
  - Removed sync of the model identifier from Intune to avoid mismatches between the identifier reported by Intune vs Teleport clients.
  - Added support for Jamf's /v2/computers-inventory API (addresses Jamf's deprecation of /v1/computers-inventory).
  - Updated the AWS Identity Center resource synchronizer to handle AWS Account name changes more gracefully.
  - Added audit events in response to SCIM provisioning requests.
