ShortDescription: Teleport provides connectivity, authentication, access controls and audit for infrastructure.
Description: |-
  Teleport includes an identity-aware access proxy, a CA that issues short-lived certificates, a unified access control system and a tunneling system to access resources behind the firewall.
  We have implemented Teleport as a single Go binary that integrates with multiple protocols and cloud services:
  - SSH nodes.
  - Kubernetes clusters
  - PostgreSQL, MongoDB, CockroachDB and MySQL databases.
  - Internal Web apps.
  - Windows Hosts.
  - Networked servers.
  You can set up Teleport as a Linux daemon or a Kubernetes deployment.
  Teleport focuses on best practices for infrastructure security:
  - No need to manage shared secrets such as SSH keys or Kubernetes tokens: it uses certificate-based auth with certificate expiration for all protocols.
  - Two-factor authentication (2FA) for everything.
  - Collaboratively troubleshoot issues through session sharing.
  - Single sign-on (SSO) for everything via GitHub Auth, OpenID Connect, or SAML with endpoints like Okta or Microsoft Entra ID.
  - Infrastructure introspection: Use Teleport via the CLI or Web UI to view the status of every SSH node, database instance, Kubernetes cluster, or internal web app.
  Teleport uses Go crypto. It is fully compatible with OpenSSH, sshd servers, and ssh clients, Kubernetes clusters and more.
ReleaseNotes: |-
  Streamable-HTTP and SSE support for MCP Zero-Trust Access
  MCP Zero-Trust Access users are now able to secure and audit connections to MCP servers that use HTTP-based transport protocols in addition to stdio.
  Improved Bot Instances Dashboard
  The Bot Instances dashboard now provides a more intuitive interface for managing a fleet of Machine & Workload Identity bot instances. This includes improved filtering, sorting and searching capabilities, and a high-level overview of the versions of all bot instances in the cluster.
  Updated Oracle Joining Support
  Oracle compute instances are no longer required to have additional IAM permissions granted to them in order to join. Oracle join tokens now also allow restricting which instances may leverage a token to join.
  Other changes and improvements
  - Fixed an issue connections to MongoDB Atlas clusters fail if clusters use certs signed by Google Trust Services (GTS). #61324
  - Improved reverse tunnel dialing recovery from default route changes by 1min on average. #61319
  - Fixed an issue Postgres database cannot be accessed via Teleport Connect when per-session MFA is enabled and the role does not have wildcard db_names. #61299
  - Improved conflict detection of application public address and Teleport cluster addresses. #61290
  - Fixed AWS Roles Anywhere cli access when using per-session MFA. #61273
  - Fixed rare error in the authorized_keys secret scanner when running the Teleport agent on MacOS. #61268
  - Updated Go to v1.24.10. #61212
  - Terraform: teleport_bot resource now supports import, and follows the standard resource structure. #61201
  - Added support for tbot to teleport-update. #61198
  - Instrumented tbot to better support teleport-update. #61189
  - Improved error message of tsh when there is a certificate DNS SAN mismatch when connecting to Auth via Proxy. #61186
  - Improved error handling during desktop sessions that encounter unknown/invalid smartcard commands. This prevents abrupt desktop session termination with a "PDU error" message when using certain applications. #61180
  - Fixed an issue causing Access Automation Rules to evaluate incorrectly when users are granted traits via Access Lists. #61169
  - Added support for tsh copying files between two hosts, i.e. tsh scp alice@foo:/path/1.txt bob@bar:/path/2.txt. #61165

  - Fixed the webUI timeout time to respect the cluster's WebIdleTimeout configuration. #61103
  - Added an option to restrict Oracle join tokens to specific instance IDs. #61078
  - Stabilized tsh paths when run from agent installation. #60873
  - Added advanced search and sorting to the bot instances list in the web UI. #60761
  - Added filter and sort flags to tctl bots instances ls. #60761
  - Added service health to the output tctl bots instances ls and tctl bot instance show commands. #60761
  - Added a dashboard to visualize bot instances by their version compatibility. #60761
  - Added bot instance service health to web UI. #60761
  - Added new env0 join method to support joining within Env0 workflows. #60710
  - Added a new OCI join method that does not require IAM policies. #60293
