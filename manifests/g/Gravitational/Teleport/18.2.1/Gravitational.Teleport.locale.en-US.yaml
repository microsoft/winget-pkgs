ShortDescription: Teleport provides connectivity, authentication, access controls and audit for infrastructure.
Description: |-
  Teleport includes an identity-aware access proxy, a CA that issues short-lived certificates, a unified access control system and a tunneling system to access resources behind the firewall.
  We have implemented Teleport as a single Go binary that integrates with multiple protocols and cloud services:
  - SSH nodes.
  - Kubernetes clusters
  - PostgreSQL, MongoDB, CockroachDB and MySQL databases.
  - Internal Web apps.
  - Windows Hosts.
  - Networked servers.
  You can set up Teleport as a Linux daemon or a Kubernetes deployment.
  Teleport focuses on best practices for infrastructure security:
  - No need to manage shared secrets such as SSH keys or Kubernetes tokens: it uses certificate-based auth with certificate expiration for all protocols.
  - Two-factor authentication (2FA) for everything.
  - Collaboratively troubleshoot issues through session sharing.
  - Single sign-on (SSO) for everything via GitHub Auth, OpenID Connect, or SAML with endpoints like Okta or Microsoft Entra ID.
  - Infrastructure introspection: Use Teleport via the CLI or Web UI to view the status of every SSH node, database instance, Kubernetes cluster, or internal web app.
  Teleport uses Go crypto. It is fully compatible with OpenSSH, sshd servers, and ssh clients, Kubernetes clusters and more.
ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Fixed client tools managed updates sequential update. #59086
  - Fixed headless login so that it supports both WebAuthn and SSO for MFA. #59078
  - When selecting a login for an SSH server, Teleport Connect now shows only logins allowed by RBAC for that specific server rather than showing all logins which the user has access to. #59067
  - Terraform Provider is now supported on Windows machines. #59055
  - Enabled Oracle Cloud joining in Machine ID's tbot client. #59040
  - Fixed a bug preventing users to create access lists with empty grants through Terraform. #59032
  - Fixed a DynamoDB bug potentially causing event queries to return a different range of events. In the worst case scenario, this bug would block the event-handler. #59029
  - Fixed an issue where SSH file copying attempts would be spuriously denied in proxy recording mode. #59027
  - Updated Enroll Integration page design. #58985
  - Teleport Connect now runs in the background by default on macOS and Windows. On Linux, this behavior can be enabled in the app configuration. #58923
  - Added fdpass-teleport binary to install script for Teleport tar downloads. #58919
  - Support multiple resource editing in tctl edit when editing collections. #58902
  - Added support for browser window resizing to the Teleport Web UI database client terminal. #58900
  - Fixed a bug that prevented root users from viewing session recordings when they were participants. #58897
  - Added ability for user to select whether IC integration creates roles for all possible Account Assignments. #58861
  - Updated Go to 1.24.7. #58835
  - Populate user_roles and user_traits fields for SSH audit events. #58804
  - Added support for wtmpdb as a user accounting backend to wtmp. #58777
  - Prevents an application from being registered if its public address matches a Teleport cluster address. #58766
  - Added a preset role mcp-user that has access to all MCP servers and their tools. #58613
  Enterprise:
  - Fixed an issue where sometimes the session summary was marked as a success, even though the summary was empty (this was particularly visible using GPT 5).
  - Updated Enroll Integration page design.
