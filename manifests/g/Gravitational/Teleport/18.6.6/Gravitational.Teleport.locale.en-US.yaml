ShortDescription: Teleport provides connectivity, authentication, access controls and audit for infrastructure.
Description: |-
  Teleport includes an identity-aware access proxy, a CA that issues short-lived certificates, a unified access control system and a tunneling system to access resources behind the firewall.
  We have implemented Teleport as a single Go binary that integrates with multiple protocols and cloud services:
  - SSH nodes.
  - Kubernetes clusters
  - PostgreSQL, MongoDB, CockroachDB and MySQL databases.
  - Internal Web apps.
  - Windows Hosts.
  - Networked servers.
  You can set up Teleport as a Linux daemon or a Kubernetes deployment.
  Teleport focuses on best practices for infrastructure security:
  - No need to manage shared secrets such as SSH keys or Kubernetes tokens: it uses certificate-based auth with certificate expiration for all protocols.
  - Two-factor authentication (2FA) for everything.
  - Collaboratively troubleshoot issues through session sharing.
  - Single sign-on (SSO) for everything via GitHub Auth, OpenID Connect, or SAML with endpoints like Okta or Microsoft Entra ID.
  - Infrastructure introspection: Use Teleport via the CLI or Web UI to view the status of every SSH node, database instance, Kubernetes cluster, or internal web app.
  Teleport uses Go crypto. It is fully compatible with OpenSSH, sshd servers, and ssh clients, Kubernetes clusters and more.
ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Fixed tsh/Linux sending a too-large username for device trust. #63387
  - Fixed an issue where MCP JSON-RPC messages with mixed-case field names could be parsed inconsistently and re-serialized to lower cases. Teleport now enforces canonical lowercase JSON-RPC fields. #63364
  - Improved robustness of the Slack hosted plugin to reduce the likeliness of failed token refresh when experiencing external disruption. #63344
  - Fixed a bug affecting access list review queries for lists where the name is a prefix of another list name. #63337
  - Updated the OCI SDK to support new regions. #63265
  - Ensure application session rejections for untrusted devices are consistently audited as AppSessionStart failures after MFA. #63149
  - Added Helm chart support to the teleport-event-handler configure command. #63147
  - Added tctl support for removing okta_assignment internal resource should it be needed. #62698
  Enterprise:
  - Prevented manual membership changes to SCIM-type access lists while enabling support for their reviews.
  - Fixed the issue where Okta integration may not remove previously synced apps after plugin restart.
