ShortDescription: Teleport provides connectivity, authentication, access controls and audit for infrastructure.
Description: |-
  Teleport includes an identity-aware access proxy, a CA that issues short-lived certificates, a unified access control system and a tunneling system to access resources behind the firewall.
  We have implemented Teleport as a single Go binary that integrates with multiple protocols and cloud services:
  - SSH nodes.
  - Kubernetes clusters
  - PostgreSQL, MongoDB, CockroachDB and MySQL databases.
  - Internal Web apps.
  - Windows Hosts.
  - Networked servers.
  You can set up Teleport as a Linux daemon or a Kubernetes deployment.
  Teleport focuses on best practices for infrastructure security:
  - No need to manage shared secrets such as SSH keys or Kubernetes tokens: it uses certificate-based auth with certificate expiration for all protocols.
  - Two-factor authentication (2FA) for everything.
  - Collaboratively troubleshoot issues through session sharing.
  - Single sign-on (SSO) for everything via GitHub Auth, OpenID Connect, or SAML with endpoints like Okta or Microsoft Entra ID.
  - Infrastructure introspection: Use Teleport via the CLI or Web UI to view the status of every SSH node, database instance, Kubernetes cluster, or internal web app.
  Teleport uses Go crypto. It is fully compatible with OpenSSH, sshd servers, and ssh clients, Kubernetes clusters and more.
ReleaseNotes: |-
  MCP server access
  Teleport now provides the ability to connect to stdio-based MCP servers with
  connection proxying and audit logging support.
  MCP for database access
  Teleport now allows MCP clients such as Claude Desktop to execute queries in
  Teleport-protected databases.
  VNet for SSH
  Teleport VNet adds native support for SSH, enabling any SSH client to connect to
  Teleport SSH servers with zero configuration. Advanced Teleport features like
  per-session MFA have first-class support for a seamless user experience.
  Identifier-first login
  Teleport adds support for identifier-first login flows. When enabled, the
  initial login screen contains only a username prompt. Users are presented with
  the SSO connectors that apply to them after submitting their username.
  Bound keypair joining for Machine ID
  The new bound keypair join method for Machine ID is a more secure and
  user-friendly alternative to token joining in both on-prem environments and
  cloud providers without a delegated join method. It allows for automatic
  self-recovery in case of expired client certificates and gives administrators
  new options to manage and automate bot joining.
  Sailpoint SCIM integration
  Teleport now supports Sailpoint as a SCIM provider allowing administrators to
  synchronize Sailpoint entitlement groups with Teleport access lists.
  LDAP server discovery for desktop access
  Teleport's windows_desktop_service can now locate the LDAP server via DNS as
  an alternative to providing the address in the configuration file.
  Managed Updates canary support
  Managed Updates v2 now support performing canary updates. When canary updates
  are enabled for a group, Teleport will update a few agents first and confirm
  they come back healthy before updating the rest of the group.
  You can unable canary updates by setting canary_count in your
  autoupdate_config:
  kind: autoupdate_config
  spec:
    agents:
      mode: enabled
      schedules:
        regular:
        - name: dev
          days:
          - Mon
          - Tue
          - Wed
          - Thu
          start_hour: 20
          canary_count: 5
      strategy: halt-on-error
  Each group can have a maximum of 5 canaries, canaries are picked randomly among
  the connected agents.
  Canary update support is currently only support by Linux agents, Kubernetes
  support will be part of a future release.
  Improved access requests UX
  Teleport's web UI makes a better distinction between just-in-time and long-term
  access request UX.
  Other changes and improvements
  - Fixed a bug causing tctl/tsh to fail on read-only file systems. #57147
  - The teleport-distroless container image now disables client tools updates by default (when using tsh/tctl, you will always use the version from the image). You can enable them back by unsetting the TELEPORT_TOOLS_VERSION environment variable. #57147
  - Fixed a crash in Teleport Connect that could occur when copying large clipboard content during desktop sessions. #57130
  - Audit log events for SPIFFE SVID issuances now include the name/label selector used by the client. #57129
  - Fixed an issue with tsh aws failing for STS and other AWS services. #57122
  - Fixed client tools managed updates downgrade to older version. #57073
  - Removed unnecessary macOS entitlements from Teleport Connect subprocesses. #57066
  - Machine and Workload ID: The tbot client will now discard expired identities if needed during renewal to allow automatic recovery without restarting the process. #57060
  - Defined access-plugin preset role. #57056
  - The tctl top command now supports the local unix sock debug endpoint. #57025
  - Added --listen flag to tsh proxy db for setting local listener address. #57005
  - Added multi-account support to teleport discovery bootstrap. #56998
  - Added TeleportRoleV8 support to the Teleport Kubernetes Operator. #56946
  - Fixed a bug in the Teleport install scripts when running on macOS. The install scripts now error instead of trying to install non existing macOS FIPS binaries. #56941
  - Fixed using relative path TELEPORT_HOME environment variable with client tools managed update. #56933
  - Client tools managed updates support multi-cluster environments and track each version in the configuration file. #56933
  - Fixed certificate revocation failures in Active Directory environments when Teleport is using HSM-backed key material. #56924
  - Fixed database connect options dialog displaying wrong database username options. #55560
  Enterprise:
  - Fixed SCIM user provisioning when a user already exists and is managed by the same connector as the SCIM integration.
  - Added enrolment for a generic SCIM Integration.
