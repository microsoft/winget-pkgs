  1.11.2 (2026-01-27)
  Happy to announce the 1.11.2 bug patch release, this includes a number of fixes which polish up Backrest's UI rewrite onto the Chakra framework.
  This release includes significant polishing work on the translations that were introduced in v1.11 and a number of UI tweaks.
  The windows installer now bundles restic.exe at the cost that the portable windows build will no longer automatically download restic, on Windows please either use the installer or manually download a restic release and place it alongside backrest.

  - add a --version flag which prints the current backrest version info (ef3ea4a)
  - add expansion of recent nodes in operation tree (4102853)
  - add settings ui preference for language (e0c5511)
  - bundle restic into windows installer (#1072) (a4aab03)
  - correctly display previously selected clock value (811e91f)
  - display well formatted language names in settings panel (3c5682a)
  - improve Russian UI localization wording and consistency (#1068) (3ee7f20)
  - keep the current repo / plan visibly selected in the side nav (e222ec0)
  - llm generated translation fixes (4934031)
  - minor update in Italian translations - it.json (#1069) (0247c41)
  - prerendering expensive children in accordion (d772dce)
  - properly format filename in downloadhandler (70a0bfc)
  - truncate too long repo/plan names (#1084) (27697c0)
