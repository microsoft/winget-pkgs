ReleaseNotes: |-
  New Design and User Experience:
  - The user interface in viewer tabs has been redesigned to ensure consistency with MightyViewer (a tool you should definitely check out — it might be the perfect fit for your particular needs!).
  - The number of saved connections has increased from 10 to 100.
  New Features:
  - Implemented multi-monitor support. Now you can choose a specific monitor in the viewer when the remote host has multiple monitors connected. This feature works when connected to TightVNC Server for Windows, starting with version 2.8.81.
  - Added desktop scaling.
  - Added an option to save VNC passwords.
  - Improved handling of authentication failures. The viewer now prompts for a password again if the previous password was incorrect.
  - Enabled editing of station names in the list of recent connections.
  - Made logging configurable.
  Bug Fixes:
  - Fixed an issue where the Home tab failed to display on startup.
  - Fixed a keyboard issue with the Alt-Gr key in Spanish, French, and German keyboard layouts.
  - Fixed incorrect session saving when starting a connection from the address line.
  - Fixed a memory leak (a bug fix in the Remote Core SDK).
  - Port numbers can now be specified with a single colon, e.g., :5900, instead of requiring two colons (::5900).
  - Various minor improvements and bug fixes.
  Other Improvements:
  - Enhanced error handling and improved displaying of error messages.
  - Added links to the MightyViewer and Remote Core SDK websites from the Remote Ripple user interface.
