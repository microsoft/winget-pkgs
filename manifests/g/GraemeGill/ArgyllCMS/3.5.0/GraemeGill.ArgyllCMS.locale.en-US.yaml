ShortDescription: An ICC compatible color management system
Description: ArgyllCMS is an ICC compatible color management system, available as Open Source. It supports accurate ICC profile creation for scanners, cameras and film recorders, and calibration and profiling of displays and RGB & CMYK printers. Device Link can be created with a wide variety of advanced options, including specialized Video calibration standards and 3dLuts. Spectral sample data is supported, allowing a selection of illuminants observer types, and paper fluorescent whitener additive compensation. Profiles can also incorporate source specific gamut mappings for perceptual and saturation intents. Gamut mapping and profile linking uses the CIECAM02 appearance model, a unique gamut mapping algorithm, and a wide selection of rendering intents. It also includes code for the fastest portable 8 bit raster color conversion engine available anywhere, as well as support for fast, fully accurate 16 bit conversion. Device color gamuts can also be viewed and compared with a modern Web browser using X3DOM. Comprehensive documentation is provided for each major tool, and a general guide to using the tools for typical color management tasks is also available. A mailing list provides support for more advanced usage.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Added MSWindows ARM release.
  - Added Mac ARM release.
  - Removed Mac PowerPC build from release.
  - Changed colprof so that rather than just warning about an ink limit being set for an additive device space, it ignores it.
  - Fixed bug in targen introduced in V3.3.0 where it adds a default ink limit for all device types. If not overidden later in the profiling process, this can introduce an ink limit 10% less than the unconstrained limit. This is a problem for additive devices.
  - Fixed reported problem with some models of Spyder2024.
  - Took a stab at adding libusb-win32 ARM64 system driver support. Reported to work, but installing libusb-win32 system driver is more difficult.
  - Added Munsell Linear Grayscale scanin reference files.  (Thanks to Tarek A. Haila and Frank Schaumann)
  - Added -g option to xicc/fakeCMY to emit RGB values rather than CMY values.
  - Tweaked i1d3 frequency measurement mode to return exactly zero on measuring perfect black rather than the correctly rounded value, so as to make it more consistent with the period measurement mode. This inconsistency shows up with a Rev. B when  I1D3_DISABLE_AIO is set and the 0x83 bug is triggered, and frequency measurement is used as a fallback to period measurement mode. Rev. A instruments shouldn't see any change since for them the period measurement mode doesn't suffer from the 0x83 bug.
  - Added -o observer option to xicc/specplot.
  - Improved robustness of command name filename parsing in a number of utilities.
  - Expand spectro/average to handle input test charts.
  - Improve JETI Specbos 2501 operation.
