ShortDescription: An ICC compatible color management system
Description: ArgyllCMS is an ICC compatible color management system, available as Open Source. It supports accurate ICC profile creation for scanners, cameras and film recorders, and calibration and profiling of displays and RGB & CMYK printers. Device Link can be created with a wide variety of advanced options, including specialized Video calibration standards and 3dLuts. Spectral sample data is supported, allowing a selection of illuminants observer types, and paper fluorescent whitener additive compensation. Profiles can also incorporate source specific gamut mappings for perceptual and saturation intents. Gamut mapping and profile linking uses the CIECAM02 appearance model, a unique gamut mapping algorithm, and a wide selection of rendering intents. It also includes code for the fastest portable 8 bit raster color conversion engine available anywhere, as well as support for fast, fully accurate 16 bit conversion. Device color gamuts can also be viewed and compared with a modern Web browser using X3DOM. Comprehensive documentation is provided for each major tool, and a general guide to using the tools for typical color management tasks is also available. A mailing list provides support for more advanced usage.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Improved reliability of i1Pro2 startup by adding recovery delay after the getmisc instruction.
  - Fixed i1pro2/3 driver to be more forgiving of wavelength calibration pushing filter offsets outside the range of raw CCD range.
  - Fixed numerical bug in targen when using -V and -c with profile with zero black.
  - Added support for Spyder X2 (thanks to Chris Minasians and A.K. for helping make an instrument available).
  - Added support for JETI 2501 spectrometer thanks to to Omardis.
  - Added -T option to targen to allow separate total ink limit for text and spacer text.
  - Modified targen CMYK chart generation to apply a level of luminance boost to the resulting OFPS samples. This partially compensates for the overall darkening of the test set due to exploring the combined K response of the device. While this will reduce the sampling density and resulting profile accuracy in darker parts of the gamut, it should improve the accuracy of colors for realistic prints, which typically have a lighter average than the device CMYK gamut.
  - Added extra diagnostics and -p plot detail to printcal. Added -z flag to allow setting a resulting calibration table resolution to values other than 256.
  - Fix 3.2.0 bug introduced into spectro/Jamfile install that omitted spec2cie from binary distributions.
