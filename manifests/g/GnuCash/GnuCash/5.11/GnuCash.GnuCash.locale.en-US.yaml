  - Bug 799564 - Decimal point confusions when getting stock quotes from aex
  - Bug 799565 - Reconcile date default doesn't update to reflect previous reconciliation.
  The following fixes and improvements were not associated with bug reports:
  - Adjust quarter begin and end dates to align with Accounting Period (Fiscal Year) start and end dates when the latter are not the first/last of the month.
  - Update Form/Schedule line references for 2024 for the US Income Tax Report
  - Better handling of complex Jump to other split operations:
    - Expand multi-split transactions in the destination register after a jump and select the destination split.
    - Emit a warning when a Jump to other split operation can't be performed instead of doing nothing.
    - When there are multiple splits but only one other account Jump will jump to the transaction in that other account's register regardless of what split is selected in the original register.
    - Do nothing when the user attempts to jump to another split in the current register's account.
    - Add a new Register preference "Jump action for multiple splits"
      Make the behaviour when the "Jump" operation encounters a transaction with more than two splits configurable. This can be configured as:
      - Do nothing (this is the default)
      - Use the split with the largest value
      - Use the split with the smallest value
      This makes it much easier to jump between accounts for stock transactions that include splits for fees and taxes, or dividend transactions that have a zero value split for the stock account.
  - Allow more account types in the payment window's transfer account list
    So far it was limited to Asset, Liability, Credit Card and either Income (for customer payments) or Expenses (for vendor payments). There are however use cases where a customer payment also covers expenses (like for example a Paypal service charge). To allow for as many edge cases as possible the filter now only excludes those account types I worry will break the business logic: AP and AR accounts. That is, with this change you won't be able to create a customer payment (which necessarily has one split an an AR account) that transfers to another AR or to an AP account. While even that may work, I am sure the business features weren't designed to cope with this and I can't exhaustively test that.
  - Support for enums as GtkRadioButton preferences
    The "=" in the widget name will separate the pref name from the enum string value that is used when the radio button is activated. When the radio button is deactivated, its preference update is ignored because another button must have been made active.
  - Allow warning dialogs to be the dismiss-only variant
    All existing dialogs are either QUESTION or WARNING. Allow INFO, ERROR and OTHER to remember being dismissed without asking a question.
  - Improve GncNumeric(std::string) to handle unicode spaces and thousands separators.
  - Add function to GncQueryView to expand column
    Add function gnc_query_set_expand_column to GncQueryView so that the expand column can be specified that takes up any available free space. Use this function in the Due Bills/Invoice Reminder to to set the expanding column to the company name.
  - [Account.hpp] New function gnc_account_get_all_parents returns reversed path vector
  - Fix python bindings built with Swig-4.3.0.
