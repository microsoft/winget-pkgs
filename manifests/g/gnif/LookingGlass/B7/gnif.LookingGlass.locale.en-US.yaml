ReleaseNotes: |-
  - [D12] Implemented indirectCopy mode for GPUs (Radeon) that fault when
    DMA is used to write directly to IVSHMEM (slower, but still faster
    then the DXGI backend).
  - [Windows] User switching should no longer cause a crash
  - [Windows] Logs are now rotated and the service log has been moved to
    prevent the wrong log being used in error reports
  - [client] Added .desktop file which is properly installed with make
    install now.
  - [module] Fixed compatibillity with 6.13+ kernels
  - [obs] Fixed outstanding bug with DMABUF that resulted in only using
    half the frames
  - [host] Fixed re-initialization race issue when the guest is suspended
    and resumed
  - [doc] Encourage usage of KVMFR/DMABUF as the standard now
  - [client] Fixed a race condition when showing overlay messages which
    would result in a crash
