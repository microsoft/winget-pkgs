ShortDescription: Windows tray utility / launcher for Syncthing (v2 continued)
Description: |
  SyncTrayzor is a little tray utility for Syncthing on Windows. It hosts and wraps Syncthing, making it behave more like a native Windows application and less like a command-line utility with a web browser interface.
Tags:
- Syncthing
