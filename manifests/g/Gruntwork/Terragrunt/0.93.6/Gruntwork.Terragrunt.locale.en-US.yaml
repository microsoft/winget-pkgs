ReleaseNotes: |-
  ⚙️ Process Improvements
  Terragrunt release automation moved to GitHub Actions
  The release automation for Terragrunt has moved to GitHub Actions. With this move, Terragrunt releases now support:
  - Windows binary signing
  - Additional packaging for artifacts (.zip and .tar.gz release artifacts)
  You can still download standalone executables from release assets for backward compatibility.
  🧪 Experiments Updated
  The filter-flag experiment now supports the source= attribute
  The --filter flag can now be used to filter units by their usage of particular OpenTofu/Terraform modules in their terraform source blocks (remember that you must use the filter-flag experiment to try this).
  # Filter by exact source match
  terragrunt find --filter 'source=github.com/acme/foo'
  terragrunt find --filter 'source=gitlab.com/example/baz'
  terragrunt find --filter 'source=./module'
  # Filter by source using glob patterns
  terragrunt find --filter 'source=*github.com**acme/*'
  terragrunt find --filter 'source=git::git@github.com:acme/**'
  terragrunt find --filter 'source=**github.com**'
  terragrunt find --filter 'source=gitlab.com/**'
  For more information, see the filter feature documentation.
