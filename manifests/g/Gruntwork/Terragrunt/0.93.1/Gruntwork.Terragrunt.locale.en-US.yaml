ReleaseNotes: |-
  🏎️ Performance Improvements
  - Reduced redundant --auth-provider-cmd invocations during run-all
  - This cuts down on external credential calls and lowers authentication overhead for large runs.
  - Updated the unit resolver to reuse the configuration parsed during discovery instead of re-parsing each terragrunt.hcl.
  - This reduces HCL parses and allocations, shortening execution time on complex stacks.
  In our internal “Run all with Auth Provider” benchmark (10 runs, ~10 ms on auth command), these changes reduced average runtime from ~235 ms to ~213 ms (about 9% faster) compared to v0.93.0.
