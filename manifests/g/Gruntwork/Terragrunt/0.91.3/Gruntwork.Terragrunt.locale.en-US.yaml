  ‚ú® New Features
  --reading flag added to the find command
  The find command now supports the --reading flag, which allows you to discover the shared configurations read by units and stacks when using the --json format.
  $ terragrunt find --reading --json
  [
    {
      "type": "unit",
      "path": "aws-account-1",
      "reading": [
        "aws-data.yml"
      ]
    },
    {
      "type": "unit",
      "path": "aws-account-2",
      "reading": [
        "aws-data.yml"
      ]
    },
    {
      "type": "unit",
      "path": "gcp-project-1",
      "reading": [
        "gcp-data.hcl"
      ]
    }
  ]
  You can use this information to drive custom logic in your workflows based on the changes related to particular files.
  e.g.
  $ terragrunt find --reading --json | jq '[.[] | select(.reading[]? | contains("aws-data.yml"))| .path]'
  [
    "aws-account-1",
    "aws-account-2"
  ]
  $ terragrunt find --reading --json | jq '[.[] | select(.reading[]? | contains("gcp-data.hcl"))| .path]'
  [
    "gcp-project-1"
  ]
  You can learn more about the --reading flag in the find documentation.
  üêõ Bug Fixes
  Empty stacks no longer throw errors
  Previously, a bug in the logic used for making sure that users didn‚Äôt accidentally run on empty stacks resulted in users getting a non-zero exit code when all units in a stack were excluded (e.g. via the exclude block).
  That bug has been fixed.
  Dependency outputs can now be used in generate blocks
  Previously, a bug in the way HCL parsing was done during discovery resulted in errors being thrown for users when dependency outputs were used in generate blocks. That error has since been resolved.
  That bug has been fixed.
