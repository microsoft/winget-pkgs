  Terraform 1.12 support: We are now testing Terragrunt against Terraform 1.12 and is confirmed to be working.
  NOTE: Although this release is marked as backward incompatible, it is functionally compatible as nothing has been changed in Terragrunt internals. The minor version release is useful to mark the change in Terraform version that is being tested.
