  üõ†Ô∏è Breaking Changes
  Removal of deprecated HCL attributes
  The skip, retryable_errors, retry_max_attempts and retry_sleep_interval_sec have all been removed from Terragrunt.
  This is the final planned breaking change on the road to Terragrunt 1.0 related to removal of deprecated functionality. Breaking changes will be minimized before Terragrunt 1.0, but may still occur based on user feedback, or based on the need to stabilize parts of Terragrunt before 1.0.
  If you are currently using the skip attribute, you'll want to adjust your usage to leverage the exclude block instead:
  Before:
  # terragrunt.hcl
  skip = true
  After:
  # terragrunt.hcl
  exclude {
    if      = true
    actions = ["all"]
  }
  If you are currently using the retryable_errors attribute, you'll want to adjust your usage to leverage the errors block instead:
  Before:
  # terragrunt.hcl
  retryable_errors = [
    ".*Error: transient network issue.*",
    ".*Error: timeout.*"
  ]
  retry_max_attempts     = 3
  retry_sleep_interval_sec = 5
  After:
  # terragrunt.hcl
  errors {
    retry "transient_errors" {
      retryable_errors = [
        ".*Error: transient network issue.*",
        ".*Error: timeout.*"
      ]
      max_attempts = 3
      sleep_interval_sec = 5
    }
  }
