  üõ†Ô∏è Breaking Changes
  Removal of legacy Terragrunt flags
  All deprecated flags that start with --terragrunt- have been removed in favor of their modern counterparts.
  This is the next step in the removal of deprecated features in
  Terragrunt on the road to Terragrunt 1.0, with more to follow. Read the CLI Redesign migration guide for future breaking changes.
  Update of stack run directory context
  The stack run command no longer assumes that users will have a .terragrunt-stack directory present in the same directory as the terragrunt.stack.hcl file. This caused issues for users that were leveraging the no_dot_terragrunt_stack attribute, as the run might have skipped over units generated outside the .terragrunt-stack directory and thrown an error if all units were generated without the .terragrunt-stack directory.
  For the following terragrunt.stack.hcl file:
  unit "foo" {
    source = "../units/foo"
    path   = "foo"
    no_dot_terragrunt_stack = true
  }
  unit "bar" {
    source = "../units/bar"
    path   = "bar"
  }
  Users would experience the following stack run output:
  tg-stack-run-before
  They will now get the following:
  tg-stack-run-after
  ‚ú® Features
  The runner-pool experiment has been integrated with OpenTelemetry
  The runner-pool experiment has been updated to integrate properly with OpenTelemetry.
  üêõ Bug Fixes
  stack output now respects no_dot_terragrunt_stack
  Previously, when running the stack output command, Terragrunt would incorrectly assume that all units were generated within a .terragrunt-stack directory. This bug has been fixed, and Terragrunt will know to look directly in the stack directory for a given unit when supplied with no_dot_terragrunt_stack.
  The runner-pool experiment no longer parses stack files as units during discovery
  A bug in the logic for the discovery package resulted in discovery errors due to terragrunt.stack.hcl files being parsed as units. That bug has been fixed.
  Fixed filesystem context for find_in_parent_folders() when used in terragrunt.stack.hcl
  The use of find_in_parent_folders() now functions correctly when run in the context of a terragrunt.stack.hcl file. Previously, it relied on the current working directory of the Terragrunt CLI, which incorrectly assumed that users would always be generating terragrunt.stack.hcl files from the current working directory.
  The discovery package now emits less false positive warnings during parsing
  The discovery package used by the find and list commands, and the runner-pool experiment has been updated to emit less unimportant warnings when parsing configurations. These warnings were for early phase parsing that are known to be safe to ignore.
  The discovery package no longer attempts to parse stack configurations as units
  A bug in the implementation of the discovery package resulted in attempts from Terragrunt to parse terragrunt.stack.hcl files as units. That has been remediated.
  üìñ Docs
  Edit Link Added
  The terragrunt-v1.gruntwork.io docs now include an "Edit page" button that conveniently allows the community to contribute fixes to documentation from within their browsers, using the GitHub UI.
