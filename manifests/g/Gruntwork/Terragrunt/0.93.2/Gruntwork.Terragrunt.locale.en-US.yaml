  ✨ New Features
  The list command now supports the dot fomat
  The list command can now render its output in the Graphviz DOT language:
  $ terragrunt list --format=dot --dependencies
  digraph {
    "live/dev/vpc" ;
    "live/dev/db" ;
    "live/dev/ec2" ;
    "live/dev/db" -> "live/dev/vpc";
    "live/dev/ec2" -> "live/dev/db";
    "live/dev/ec2" -> "live/dev/vpc";
    "live/prod/vpc" ;
    "live/prod/db" ;
    "live/prod/ec2" ;
    "live/prod/db" -> "live/prod/vpc";
    "live/prod/ec2" -> "live/prod/db";
    "live/prod/ec2" -> "live/prod/vpc";
  }
  This was previously only possible using the dag graph command, but that command has been refactored to be an alias for the list --format=dot --dependencies command, to provide greater flexibility in how graphs are rendered in the DOT language. This includes integration with the experimental Filter feature.
  You can learn more about this in the list command documentation
