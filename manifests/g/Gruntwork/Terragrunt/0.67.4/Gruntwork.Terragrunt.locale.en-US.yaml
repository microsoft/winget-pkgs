  Description
    feat: Added TERRAGRUNT_TEMP_QUOTE_NULL environment variable to change the handling of null values.
  TERRAGRUNT_TEMP_QUOTE_NULL
    Setting the value of this undocumented feature flag to 1 allows users to temporarily revert the breaking change in release v0.50.0, preventing the sending of string "null" as the value of an input to OpenTofu/Terraform instead of not set an input at all.

    The flag is being introduced into the codebase for a temporary duration to support Enterprise customers that have asked for this as a stop gap while they update their codebase to no longer need it.

    Terragrunt will not support this flag in the future. Do not rely on it.

    We will be coordinating closely with Enterprise customers to determine when they no longer need it supported. At that time, removal of the feature flag will be scheduled, then removed.
