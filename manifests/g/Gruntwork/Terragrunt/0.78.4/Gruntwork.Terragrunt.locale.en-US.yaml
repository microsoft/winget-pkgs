ReleaseNotes: |-
  ✨ New Features
  OpenTelemetry Trace Propogation
  In anticipation of the introduction of OpenTelemetry support in OpenTofu 1.10, Terragrunt will now propagate the TRACEPARENT environment variable to child processes to support OpenTelemetry traces that maintain context across Terragrunt and OpenTofu.
  This work is based on @Yantrio 's PoC PR #4254, and is only useful due to his work adding OpenTelemtry in OpenTofu. Thank you!
