  üêõ Bug Fixes
  When an error retry results in a plan succeeding when it initially failed, usage of run --all -- plan -detailed-exitcode will now properly take into account the final exit code, rather than the first one, meaning that the exit code of the whole run will be zero if no other units fail their plans.
  Thanks to @wakeful for contributing this fix!
