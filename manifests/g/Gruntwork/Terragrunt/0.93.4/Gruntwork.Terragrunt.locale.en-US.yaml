  🧪 Updated Experiments
  The filter-flag experiment now supports graph expressions
  The --filter flag now supports usage of graph expressions, allowing users to filter based on the dependency relationship of units discovered by Terragrunt (remember that you must use the filter-flag experiment to try this).
  e.g.
  # Find 'service' and everything it depends on
  terragrunt find --filter 'service...'
  # Find 'vpc' and everything that depends on it
  terragrunt find --filter '...vpc'
  # Find 'db' and its complete dependency graph
  terragrunt find --filter '...db...'
  # Find all dependents of 'vpc' but exclude 'vpc' itself
  terragrunt find --filter '...^vpc'
  You can learn more about graph-based filtering in the filter feature documentation.
