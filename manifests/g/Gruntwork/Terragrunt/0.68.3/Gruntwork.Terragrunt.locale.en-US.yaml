ReleaseNotes: |-
  New Features
    This release introduces the availability of Strict Mode, a new pattern that is going to be used for deprecation of functionality going forward in Terragrunt.
    Starting with this release, any deprecated functionality will be deprecated using what are called Strict Controls. These controls will allow you to opt-in to having any deprecated functionality break immediately. This mechanism is being introduced to provide a way for users to future proof their codebase, and know that they can safely upgrade to new versions of Terragrunt.
    This will be especially important to address the changes listed in #3445.
