ReleaseNotes: |-
  What's Changed
    Allow pre-release versions to pass version constraints.
    Fixing output STDOUT logs to stdout. Without the --terragrunt-forward-tf-stdout flag, STDOUT level log entries were sent to stdout. They mixed with the JSON output and could cause parsing issues in the user's workflow.
