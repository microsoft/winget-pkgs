  ✨ New Features
  Introduction of hcl commands
  As part of the CLI Redesign experiment, the hcl commands have been introduced.
  The hcl commands allow users to directly interact with HCL content independent of the underlying functionality they support.
  The functionality of the hcl commands replace existing functionality that is soon to be deprecated:
  - hclfmt --> hcl fmt
  - hclvalidate --> hcl validate
  - validate-inputs --> hcl validate --inputs
  - validate-inputs --strict-validate --> hcl validate --inputs --strict
