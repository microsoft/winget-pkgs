  🛠️ Breaking Changes
  The --queue-exclude-external flag has been deprecated
  Previously, Terragrunt would automatically pull in external dependencies (dependencies outside the current working directory when running terragrunt run --all) into the run queue.
  To prevent this behavior, users had to manually supply the --queue-exclude-external flag. This has caused significant confusion and unexpected behavior for users over the duration of it’s existence in the Terragrunt CLI. To prevent this unexpected behavior for users and follow the principle of least surprise, this flag has been deprecated and its behavior is now the default in Terragrunt.
  To explicitly request inclusion of external dependencies in the run queue, use the —queue-include-external flag.
  ⚙️ Process Updates
  OpenTofu 1.11.x added to compatibility matrix
  We are now continuously testing against OpenTofu 1.11.1 in our Continuous Integration testing, and have updated the compatibility matrix to reflect that.
  🧪 Updated Experiments
  The filter-flag experiment now supports Git-based expressions
  The --filter flag can now be used to filter units based on changes in Git history (remember that you must use the filter-flag experiment to try this).
  # Compare between two references
  terragrunt find --filter '[main...HEAD]'
  # Shorthand: compare reference to HEAD
  terragrunt find --filter '[main]'
  # Compare between specific commits
  terragrunt find --filter '[abc123...def456]'
  # Compare between tags
  terragrunt find --filter '[v1.0.0...v2.0.0]'
  # Compare using relative references
  terragrunt find --filter '[HEAD~1...HEAD]'
  # Compare between branches
  terragrunt find --filter '[feature-branch...main]'
  For more information, see the dedicated documentation on Git-Based Filtering.
  🐛 Bug Fixes
  Units now properly flush stdout in run --all
  A regression in unit stdout flushing caused stdout for unit logs to hang pending resolution of run --all runs. This regression has been fixed to ensure that logs are streamed in real time again.
  Queue entries now properly run, even if dependent units are excluded
  A bug in run queue optimization made it so that excluding the dependent of a unit within a multi-unit run queue would incorrectly exclude the dependency unit from the run queue. This bug has been resolved, and units are now properly included, even if their dependents are excluded.
  Provider cache server only contacts relevant registries
  The provider cache server was incorrectly establishing a connection with multiple registries even though only one registry for a given IaC tool run by Terragrunt. For users with network-restricted environments, this could cause problems. Terragrunt will now only contact the relevant registry for a given IaC tool unless users explicitly request for usage of multiple registries.
  📖 Documentation Updates
  Provider cache server no longer documented as experimental
  The Provider Cache Server has been used in production by a good portion of the Terragrunt community based on voluntary community reporting. The need for the feature is also mitigated by advances in OpenTofu that makes the Automatic Provider Cache Dir the default solution all Terragrunt users using OpenTofu ≥ v1.10.0.
  As such, the Provider Cache Server has been promoted to a generally available feature that is exclusively opt-in for users that cannot benefit from the Automatic Provider Cache Dir feature, or are better served by the Provider Cache Server due to scale or platform limitations.
