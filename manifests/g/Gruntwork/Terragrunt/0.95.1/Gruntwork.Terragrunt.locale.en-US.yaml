  🧪 Experiments Updated
  The filter-flag experiment now supports the --filter-affected flag
  The --filter-affected flag has been introduced as an convenience alias for --filter [main...HEAD] (remember that you must use the filter-flag experiment to try this).
  terragrunt find --filter-affected
  Note that if you have local Git configurations that results in a different branch being your default branch, that branch will be used instead of main.
  🐛 Bug Fixes
  Integration of --queue-strict-include with --queue-include-units-reading fixed
  A regression in --queue-strict-include resulted in empty run queues when using a combination of --queue-strict-include with --queue-include-units-reading. That bug has been resolved.
  Integration of --source with run --all fixed
  A regression in --source prevented it from working correctly in combination with run --all , resulting in empty run queues. That bug has been resolved.
  Integration of Git-expressions with explicit stacks
  A bug in the implementation of explicit stack generation for Git-expressions prevented stacks from being generated in Git worktrees when using Git-expressions in the filter-flag experiment. That bug has been resolved.
