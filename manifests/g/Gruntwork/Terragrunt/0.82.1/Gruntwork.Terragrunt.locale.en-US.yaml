  üß™ Experiments Updated
  The cas experiment now supports terraform block source attributes
  The cas experiment now supports de-duplication of OpenTofu/Terraform module source cloning during unit initialization.
  This both reduces time spent cloning OpenTofu/Terraform module sources by reducing network bandwidth overhead, and reduces disk utilization.

  You can learn more about the CAS feature in the dedicated feature documentation.
  üêõ Bugs Fixed
  The hcl validate command now returns an appropriate exit code
  When using hcl validate, if any unit fails validation when run against a stack of units, the final exit code with be non-zero when any unit fails validation.
  While this is technically a bugfix that is a üõ†Ô∏è breaking change in behavior, maintainers have opted to release this as part of a patch release, as it's what most users expect from the command, it's how the command is documented, and avoiding the breaking change is fairly simple:
  terragrunt hcl validate || true
  We are also trying to reduce the number of minor releases on the road to 1.0 to make it easier to focus on the big changes that require significant adjustment in usage of Terragrunt, and want to make sure that users take special note of breaking removal of deprecated functionality.
