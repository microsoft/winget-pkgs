  🧪 Experiments Updated
  --summary-unit-duration replaced with --summary-per-unit
  Per design feedback, the flag --summary-unit-duration has been replaced with --summary-per-unit in the report experiment.
  The final summary at the end of runs was updated from looking like this by default:
  $ terragrunt run --all plan
  # Omitted for brevity...
  ❯❯ Run Summary
     Duration:   62ms
     Units:      3
     Succeeded:  3
  To looking like this:
  $ terragrunt run --all plan
  # Omitted for brevity...
  ❯❯ Run Summary  3 units  62ms
     ────────────────────────────
     Succeeded    3
  In addition, the flag --summary-unit-duration that resulted in summaries that looked like this:
  $ terragrunt run --all plan --summary-unit-duration
  # Omitted for brevity...
  ❯❯ Run Summary
     Duration:   10m
        long-running-unit:    10m
        medium-running-unit:  12s
        short-running-unit:   5ms
     Units:      3
     Succeeded:  3
  Was replaced with the --summary-per-unit flag that results in summaries that look like this:
  $ terragrunt run --all plan --summary-per-unit
  # Omitted for brevity...
  ❯❯ Run Summary  3 units     10m
     ──────────────────────────────
     Succeeded (3)
        long-running-unit     10m
        medium-running-unit   12s
        short-running-unit    5ms
  This was done to streamline the information conveyed by the run summary, and to maximize leverage over the screen real estate taken by the summary.
  The report experiment is still ongoing, and community feedback is encouraged. Please share any feedback you may have before the design of Run Reports and Run Summaries are finalized.
