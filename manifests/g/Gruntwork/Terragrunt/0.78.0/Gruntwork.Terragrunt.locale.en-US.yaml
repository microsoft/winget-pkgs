ReleaseNotes: |-
  üß™ Experiments Completed
  The stacks experiment is now complete.
  If you were previously using the flag --experiment stacks to opt in to experimental functionality, you no longer have to do so. Note that if you are, you will simply get a warning that it is no longer necessary.
  üõ†Ô∏è Breaking Changes
  Legacy commands (as replaced by the CLI Redesign are now deprecated, and will be phased out at a future date, which will be scheduled in #3535. Make sure to subscribe to the issue if you would like to be informed when these deprecated features are no longer supported.
  For instructions on migrating to the new commands provided after the CLI Redesign, read the CLI Redesign Migration Guide.
  The following are now deprecated:
  - hclfmt (use hcl fmt instead)
  - hclvalidate (use hcl validate instead)
  - validate-inputs (use hcl validate --inputs and hcl validate --inputs --strict instead)
  - terragrunt-info (use info print instead)
  - output-module-groups (use find --dag --json instead)
  - render-json (use render --json -w instead)
  - graph-dependencies (use dag graph instead)
  - run-all (use run --all instead)
  - graph (use run --graph instead)
  - The default command. e.g. terragrunt workspace list (use terragrunt run -- workspace list instead)
  - Default bootstrap (automatically provisioning backend resources without additional flags). This is now opt in behavior, and requires usage of the --backend-bootstrap flag or explicitly running the new backend bootstrap command.
  - aws-provider-patch (we are simply deprecating this command, and removing it when the other commands are removed. It served its purpose as a short term stopgap tool).
  Note that this will not result in an immediate breaking change for users, as we‚Äôll have an initial deprecation window to give users time to adjust to these changes. If you‚Äôd like to ensure that you are prepared for the future removal of legacy commands, you can take advantage of the cli-redesign strict control to opt in to the future breaking change early.
  üí™üèΩ Enhancements
  The logging for stack generation has been improved to make it easier to determine at a glance the stack file that‚Äôs generating a particular unit.
