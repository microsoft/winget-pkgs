  🏎️ Performance Improvements
  Discovery performance improved
  The way in which Terragrunt discovers and filters units and stacks for runs has improved significantly.

  Terragrunt is now better at avoiding parsing units/stacks unnecessarily, based on the filter you use. Previously, the logic used was more coarse, and could result in a requirement to parse some configurations (e.g. presence of a dependency graph expression to result in parsing all configurations. Discovery has been refactored to allow for much more careful opt-in parsing based on the need to support the filter used by users (or lack thereof).
  This will also result in improvements to Terragrunt’s ability to ignore broken parts of infrastructure estates when Terragrunt can predictably determine that it won’t impact a run.
  🐛 Bug Fixes
  Invalid unit configurations cause explicit errors instead of silently being excluded during runs
  A bug in discovery logic resulted in units with invalid HCL configurations being silently excluded from runs with a warning. This bug has been fixed, and attempting to parse invalid HCL configurations during a run will result in an error.
