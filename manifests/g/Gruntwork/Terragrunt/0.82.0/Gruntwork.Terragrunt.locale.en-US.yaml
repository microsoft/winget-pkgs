ReleaseNotes: |-
  Description
  OpenTofu 1.10 support: We are now testing Terragrunt against OpenTofu 1.10, and is confirmed to be working.
  NOTE: Although this release is marked as backward incompatible, it is functionally compatible as nothing has been changed in Terragrunt internals. The minor version release is useful to mark the change in the OpenTofu version that is being tested.
  What's Changed
  - Add support for OpenTofu 1.10 by @denis256 in #4465
