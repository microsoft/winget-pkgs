  üõ†Ô∏è Breaking Changes
  Removal of legacy-all commands
  The following commands have been removed from the Terragrunt CLI:
  - spin-up
  - tear-down
  - plan-all
  - apply-all
  - destroy-all
  - output-all
  - validate-all
  If you have been using any of these commands, see the migration guide under Removal of longstanding deprecated commands here.
  This is the first step in the removal of deprecated features in Terragrunt on the road to Terragrunt 1.0, with more to follow. You are also advised to read the CLI Redesign migration documentation for future breaking changes.
  See #3535 for more details.
  ‚ú® New Features
  Catalog/Scaffold now support --no-dependency-prompt
  The catalog/scaffold commands now support a new --no-dependency-prompt flag that disables the Boilerplate dependency prompt (equivalent of --disable-dependency-prompt in Boilerplate).
  This allows Boilerplate templates with dependencies to be used non-interactively, even when called by Catalog and Scaffold.
  exclude block now supports no_run
  The exclude block now supports the no_run attribute, which lets users prevent direct runs of a unit when the run matches the configuration of an exclude block.
  e.g. When users define an exclude block like the following:
  # foo/terragrunt.hcl
  exclude {
      if      = true
      actions = ["plan"]
  }
  Terragrunt will only exclude the unit foo from the run queue if the user supplies a command like run --all plan. If a user uses the run plan command directly in the foo directory, it‚Äôs assumed that they are doing so intentionally, and don‚Äôt want the run to exit early.
  Users can now specify no_run to explicitly tell Terragrunt that it should never be run, even if a user attempts to perform the run in the unit directory directly.
  # foo/terragrunt.hcl
  exclude {
      if      = true
      no_run  = true
      actions = ["plan"]
  }
  üí™üèΩ Enhancements
  Stacks are now fully regenerated when the --source-update flag is set
  The .terragrunt-stack directory is now fully regenerated when the --source-update flag is set, similar to how the .terragrunt-cache directory is regenerated when the flag is set.
  This addresses some edge-cases where changes to local sources for units and stacks didn‚Äôt result in updates to generated stack configurations.
  üêõ Bug Fixes
  Stack Outputs Are Now Sorted
  To ensure consistency in the order in which outputs are displayed when using the stack output command, outputs are now sorted before they are displayed.
  Lockfiles With Strong Constraints Normalized
  When manually generating lockfiles from the Provider Cache Server for modules with strong constraints like the following:
  terraform {
    required_providers {
      aws = {
        source  = "hashicorp/aws"
        version = "= 5.100.0"
      }
    }
  }
  Generated lockfiles now properly strip the = when generating the lockfile, as = constraints aren‚Äôt supported in .terraform.lock.hcl files.
