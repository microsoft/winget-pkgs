  ✨ New Features
  Introduction of the render command
  As part of the CLI Redesign experiment, the render command has been introduced.
  The render command allows users to easily render Terragrunt unit configurations with reduced complexity, making it easier to understand configurations at a glance.
  For example, the following terragrunt.hcl file:
  # terragrunt.hcl
  locals {
    aws_region = "us-east-1"
  }
  inputs = {
    aws_region = local.aws_region
  }
  Renders to the following JSON:
  $ terragrunt render --format json
  {
    "locals": { "aws_region": "us-east-1" },
    "inputs": { "aws_region": "us-east-1" }
    // NOTE: other attributes are omitted for brevity
  }
  The introduction of the render command is part of the eventual deprecation of the existing render-json command, which will be deprecated by the end of the CLI Redesign. The render command is a higher level command, that offers the ability to write to stdout, in addition to writing to files, and will support HCL configurations in addition to JSON (coming soon).
  To learn more about the render command, read the official documentation here.
