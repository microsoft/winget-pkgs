  ðŸ§ªÂ Experiments Updated
  filter-flag updated with reading= support
  The --filter flag now supports usage of the reading= attribute to filter on components that read particular shared infrastructure configurations.
  e.g.
  terragrunt find --filter 'reading=shared.hcl'
  terragrunt find --filter 'reading=common/*.hcl' # Globs supported!
  terragrunt find --filter 'reading=config/**' # Double-wildcard globs are required filtering on files nested in subdirectories.
  terragrunt find --filter 'reading=config/vars.tfvars'
  This behavior is similar to that provided by the --queue-include-units-reading flag, with additional support for globs, negation and filter chaining supported in the --filter flag more generally.
  For more information, see the documentation on Attribute-Based Filtering.
  If you give this feature a try, make sure to share your feedback on the Filter Flag RFC
