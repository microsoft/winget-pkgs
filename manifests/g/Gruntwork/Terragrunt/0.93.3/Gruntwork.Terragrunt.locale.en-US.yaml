  🐛 Bug Fixes
  hcl validate --inputs regression on validation blocks resolved
  A bug introduced in v0.93.1 preventing hcl validate --inputs from succeeding on OpenTofu/Terraform modules with variables containing validation blocks. This was caused by an error in the update to OpenTofu/Terraform .tf file parsing by Terragrunt in the hcl validate command.
  That bug has been resolved.
  What's Changed
  - fix: Allow validation blocks in inputs by @ThisGuyCodes in #5063
  - chore: Updating pin to v0.93.2 for remote references by @yhakbar in #5058
  - build(deps): bump tar from 7.5.1 to 7.5.2 in /docs-starlight by @dependabot[bot] in #5057
  Full Changelog: v0.93.2...v0.93.3
