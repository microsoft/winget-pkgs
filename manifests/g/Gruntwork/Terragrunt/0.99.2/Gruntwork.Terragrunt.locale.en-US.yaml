ReleaseNotes: |-
  🐛 Bug Fixes
  Interrupt signal propagation to OpenTofu/Terraform fixed
  The mechanism by which Terragrunt sends interrupt signals to OpenTofu/Terraform processes it started has been made more robust. Terragrunt will now send the interrupt signal in the event that a user explicitly sends an interrupt signal to Terragrunt in addition to scenarios where Terragrunt’s context cancellation is triggered (e.g. in the event of a timeout).
  SOPS decryption race condition fixed
  A race condition in the concurrent access to SOPS decrypted secrets in different environments combined with usage of the --auth-provider-cmd flag resulted in authentication failures. Synchronization controls have been introduced to ensure authentication proceeds correctly for each environment independently.
  What's Changed
  - chore: Backporting #5518 to v0.99 by @yhakbar in #5547
  - chore: SOPS decode improvements by @denis256 in #5549
