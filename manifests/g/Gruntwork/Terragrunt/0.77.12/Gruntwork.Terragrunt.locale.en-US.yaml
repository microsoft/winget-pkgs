ReleaseNotes: |-
  ✨ New Features
  Introduced no_validation attribute for stack and unit, allowing users to bypass Terragrunt's validation checks when deploying infrastructure. This is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to deploy infrastructure that doesn't strictly adhere to Terragrunt's validation rules, such as during emergency deployments or when working with legacy infrastructure patterns.
  What's Changed
  - docs: added more docs for stacks by @yhakbar in #4144
  - feat: added support for no_validation attribute for stack and unit by @denis256 in #4149
  RFC: #3313
