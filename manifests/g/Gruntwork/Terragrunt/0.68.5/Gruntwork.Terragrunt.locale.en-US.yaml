  What's Changed
    Added strict flag for improved performance in dependency processing
    You can now enhance performance by setting the environment variable:
    TERRAGRUNT_STRICT_CONTROL="skip-dependencies-inputs"
    This will skip input processing for dependencies, leading to faster execution times when running Terragrunt.
    Improved CI/CD pipeline to build without Go proxy and detect checksum changes.
    Enhanced error messages for invalid strict control flags.
    Updated dependencies for better performance and stability.
    Refined scaffold documentation.
    Fixed panic issue in Sops decryption.
    Corrected handling of pseudo-tty commands.
