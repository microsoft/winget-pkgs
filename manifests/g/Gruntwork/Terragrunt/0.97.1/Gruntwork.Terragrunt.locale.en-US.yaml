  ✨ New Features
  All HCL functions instrumented with OpenTelemetry
  All Terragrunt HCL functions are now instrumented to emit telemetry when they run, giving more insight into HCL function performance, and usage.
  HCL parsing telemetry improved
  Additional fidelity has been added to traces emitted during parsing to give insight as to why configuration parsing is being performed, and how.
  🐛 Bug Fixes
  plan -destroy called correctly for --filter-affected
  A bug in the logic for --filter-affected resulted in removed units getting planned/applied instead of being destroyed when users supplied --filter-allow-destroy. That bug has been fixed.
  Nested spans in track parents appropriately even when the TRACEPARENT environment variable is used.
  A bug in the logic for propagating TRACEPARENT as the ultimate parent of traces started in Terragrunt prevented child traces from properly tracking parent spans. That bug has been fixed.
  Reports on runs in worktrees now use relative directories to worktree root
  Instead of displaying runs of units in Git worktrees during Git-based filter expression runs with the absolute path of their directories in a temporary directory, they now display with the path to the unit relative to the root of the worktree.
  Unnecessary relationship discovery prevented
  Discovery of relationships between units has been made opt-in in the discovery process. This will result in no changes to usage of commands like run --all, but will significantly improve the performance of commands like list and stack generate.
