  ✨ New Features
  Support for --exclude and --queue-construct-as in find and list
  The find and list commands have been updated to leverage new capabilities involving greater understanding of the Terragrunt run queue.
  Users can now leverage the --queue-construct-as (or just --as) flag in the find and list commands to discover configurations as if a particular Terragrunt command was being run (e.g. plan, destroy).
  For example:
  $ terragrunt find --queue-construct-as=plan
  stacks/live/dev
  stacks/live/prod
  units/live/dev/vpc
  units/live/prod/vpc
  units/live/dev/db
  units/live/prod/db
  units/live/dev/ec2
  units/live/prod/ec2
  $ terragrunt find --as=destroy
  stacks/live/dev
  stacks/live/prod
  units/live/dev/ec2
  units/live/prod/ec2
  units/live/dev/db
  units/live/prod/db
  units/live/dev/vpc
  units/live/prod/vpc
  The find and list commands will now construct the Terragrunt run queue as if a particular command was being run, potentially altering the position of elements in the run queue, based on their dependencies (dependencies before dependents for plans, applies, etc. and dependents before dependencies for destroys).
  In addition, users can leverage the --exclude flag on the find command to get information on the exclude block included in results. The exclude block is also factored in to discovery results when the --queue-construct-as flag is passed, allowing users to dry-run behavior of the exclude block before performing any Terragrunt runs.
