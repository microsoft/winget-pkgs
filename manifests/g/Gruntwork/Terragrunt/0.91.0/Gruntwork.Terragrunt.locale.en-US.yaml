  Removal of behavior where inputs are read from dependencies
  üõ†Ô∏è Breaking Changes
  Removal of behavior where inputs are read from dependencies
  Terragrunt no longer exposes dependency inputs as accessible values.
  This change improves performance and simplifies dependency handling by removing a feature that significantly slowed configuration parsing due to a requirement for recursive parsing of dependencies of dependencies for every dependent.
  If your configurations currently access dependency inputs like this:
  dependency "foo" {
    config_path = "../foo"
  }
  inputs = {
    my_input = dependency.foo.inputs.an_input_from_foo
  }
  You‚Äôll need to update them to reference outputs instead:
  dependency "foo" {
    config_path = "../foo"
  }
  inputs = {
    my_input = dependency.foo.outputs.an_output_from_foo
  }
  Accessing outputs remains the supported and recommended way to share data between modules.
