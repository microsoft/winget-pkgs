  üß™ Experiments Updated
  The reports experiment now supports the --summary-unit-duration flag
  As part of delivering #3628 , the reports experiment has been updated to support optionally displaying unit-level duration information in the Run Summary.
  You can now optionally display the duration for each unit run as part of the Run Summary by adding the --summary-unit-duration flag to your run commands:
  e.g.
  $ terragrunt run --all plan --summary-unit-duration
  # Omitted for brevity...
