  ðŸ§ª Experiments Introduced
  filter-flag introduced
  A new experiment named filter-flag has been introduced, allowing for experimental usage of the new --filter flag described in RFC #4060. The filter-flag experiment is incomplete, and minimal support for the --filter flag has been added exclusively to the find and list commands.
  The filter flag allows for sophisticated querying of particular Terragrunt stacks and units in a way that is currently only possible using a combination of â€”queue- prefixed flags.
  Example filter usage might look like the following:
  $ terragrunt find --filter './prod/** | name=web'
  prod/services/web
  Important
  While the filter-flag experiment is active, you will need to enable the filter-flag experiment for any command that uses the filter-flag. See Controlling Experiment Mode for more details.
  e.g.
  terragrunt find --experiment filter-flag --filter './prod/** | name=web'
  You can learn more about filters, including documentation on the syntax and examples of each type of filter in the dedicated feature documentation for filters.
