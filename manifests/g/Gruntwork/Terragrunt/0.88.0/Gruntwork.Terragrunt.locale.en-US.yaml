  🛠️ Breaking Changes
  Default Command Forwarding Removed
  Terragrunt no longer forwards unknown top‑level commands to OpenTofu by default.
  Invoking an unknown command now fails with guidance to use the explicit run form.
  This is the next step in the removal of deprecated features in Terragrunt on the road to Terragrunt 1.0, with more to follow. Read the CLI Redesign migration guide for guidance on adapting to future breaking changes.
  For a full list of deprecated features that will be removed prior to the release of Terragrunt 1.0, see the removal schedule.
  ❌ Old Behavior (Deprecated)
  terragrunt workspace ls
  terragrunt graph
  ✅ New Behavior
  terragrunt run -- workspace ls
  terragrunt run -- graph
  🔧 Migration Guide
  Keep using shortcuts for common commands:
  terragrunt plan
  terragrunt apply
  Replace usage of any OpenTofu/Terraform command that isn’t a supported shortcut with explicit usage of the run command:
  terragrunt workspace ls => terragrunt run -- workspace ls
  terragrunt graph => terragrunt run -- graph
  When mixing Terragrunt and OpenTofu flags, separate them with --:
  terragrunt run -- apply -auto-approve
  terragrunt run -- output -json
  terragrunt run --all -- plan -var foo=bar
  Command-specific flags must be used after their commands
  As part of the changes to remove the deprecated behavior of forwarding unknown commands to OpenTofu by default, users can no longer treat flags as global flags unless they are in-fact global flags.
  For example, the following will still work:
  terragrunt --log-level debug plan
  terragrunt --no-color plan
  But the following will no longer be supported:
  terragrunt --provider-cache run --all plan
  Instead, you must supply flags after the commands they are used by:
  terragrunt run --all --provider-cache plan
  Flag Scope Changes (backend + feature flags)
  Backend migration and feature-related flags are now command-scoped and should appear after the relevant subcommand.
  These flags are accepted on run, backend, scaffold, find, and list
  Affected flags:
  - backend-bootstrap
  - backend-require-bootstrap
  - disable-bucket-update
  - feature key=value
  ❌ Old Behavior (Deprecated)
  Command-specific flags could be set anywhere in the arguments for a command:
  terragrunt --backend-bootstrap backend delete --all
  terragrunt --feature stage=true plan
  ✅ New Behavior
  Place flags after the respective command they control:
  terragrunt backend bootstrap --backend-bootstrap
  terragrunt plan --feature stage=true
  terragrunt find --feature stage=true
  🔧 Migration Guide
  Move these flags to follow the subcommand they apply to
  terragrunt --feature stage=true plan => terragrunt plan --feature stage=true
