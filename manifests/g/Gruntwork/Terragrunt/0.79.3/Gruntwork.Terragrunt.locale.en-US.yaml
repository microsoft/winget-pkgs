  üí™üèΩ Enhancements
  Limitation on Catalog URLs lifted
  A limitation on only supporting recognized go-getter URL patters has been lifted from the catalog command.
  The reason this limitation existed in the past was to ensure that users were able to have Terragrunt load module source code in browsers from the catalog Terminal User Interface (TUI). To support that, only a constrained set of sources were supported, to ensure that a button was available to pop open the link in the browser.

  Terragrunt will now dynamically adjust the buttons available after module selection to gracefully degrade the experience, instead of completely rejecting repository sources that can't be predictably converted to browser URLs.

  This allows more users to adopt the Terragrunt Catalog, while providing the same great user experience for users that are on fully supported platforms, like GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, etc.
