  ✨ New Features
  Scaffold now supports Boilerplate dependencies and partials
  The Scaffold feature now supports leveraging Boilerplate dependencies and partials.
  This was a missing feature in the integration between Scaffold and Boilerplate, and Terragrunt users do not have to change anything in how they invoke Scaffold to have custom Boilerplate templates properly render using those Boilerplate features.
  Special thanks to @tgeijg for contributing this feature!
