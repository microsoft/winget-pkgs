ReleaseNotes: |-
  ‚ú® New Features
  find adds support for --include
  The find command now supports the --include flag to allow for fine grained control over the discovery of units that include other partial configurations.
  e.g.
  $ terragrunt find --include --format=json | jq
  [
    {
      "type": "unit",
      "path": "bar",
      "include": {
        "cloud": "cloud.hcl"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "unit",
      "path": "foo"
    }
  ]
  Combining the flag with tools like jq allows for simple discovery of configurations that include other partial configurations.
  $ terragrunt find --include --format=json | jq '[.[] | select(.include.cloud == "cloud.hcl")]'
  [
    {
      "type": "unit",
      "path": "bar",
      "include": {
        "cloud": "cloud.hcl"
      }
    }
  ]
  üêõ Bug Fixes
  --tf-path now correctly overrides terraform_binary
  A bug in the precedence logic for Terragrunt configuration parsing resulted in the CLI flag --tf-path from being ignored when the terraform_binary attribute was set.
  Terragrunt will now correctly respect the terraform_binary attribute when set, and allow --tf-path to override the value when it is set.
