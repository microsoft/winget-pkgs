  üêõ Bug Fixes
  Stacks now generate in topological order
  A race condition caused by concurrent generation of nested Terragrunt Stacks when a .terragrunt-stack directory already exists has been remediated.
  Stacks will now generate topologically regardless of whether they are cleanly generated or generated when a terragrunt-stack directory already exists, resulting in parent stacks generating before child stacks.
  get_aws_account_id() interaction with --auth-provider-cmd fixed
  A bug introduced in the upgrade to AWS SDK v2 in v0.85.1 where get_aws_account_id() would not work properly when used in conjunction with the --auth-provider-cmd flag has been remediated.
  Custom API endpoints for backend resources are now set correctly
  A bug introduced in the upgrade to AWS SDK v2 in v0.85.1 where integration with the S3 and DynamoDB AWS SDK clients did not properly respect the endpoint setting for backend configurations has been remediated.
  ref properly handled in catalog urls
  The use of the ref query string parameter in Catalog go-getter URLs has been fixed, allowing users to explicitly specify the ref they want to use for their catalog sources.
  dag graph updated to support all run flags
  The dag graph command has been updated to support all flags supported by the run command.
  üìñ Docs
  Terragrunt Scale page published
  The Terragrunt Scale page has been published, showcasing a new offering from Gruntwork to help customers scale up their IaC usage. It showcases the integration Terragrunt has with commercial offerings from Gruntwork to help organizations scale their infrastructure management.
  The Terralith to Terragrunt has been published
  A step-by-step guide to transitioning IaC configurations from a Terralith (where all resources are in a single state file) to a modern Terragrunt IaC configuration, using Terragrunt Stacks has been published named Terralith to Terragrunt.
  This is the first major guide in this style, with more to come in the future to address specific pain points for members of the community in a step-by-step guide, rather than a reference or high level summary of features.
