  ✨ New Features
  Support for HCL formatting with the render command
  As part of the CLI Redesign experiment, the render command now supports HCL formatting for rendered configurations, which is the default output format.
  Using the render command with HCL formatting allows users to get a quick, minimal evaluation of Terragrunt unit configurations with as much pre-processing done as possible.
  For example, the following terragrunt.hcl file:
  # terragrunt.hcl
  locals {
    aws_region = "us-east-1"
  }
  inputs = {
    aws_region = local.aws_region
  }
  Renders to the following HCL:
  $ terragrunt render
  locals {
    aws_region = "us-east-1"
  }
  inputs = {
    aws_region = "us-east-1"
  }
  Using the render command with HCL formatting offers a way to resolve complex HCL function evaluation, include merging or string interpolation, etc. to achieve equivalent Terragrunt HCL configurations that are easier to reason about.
