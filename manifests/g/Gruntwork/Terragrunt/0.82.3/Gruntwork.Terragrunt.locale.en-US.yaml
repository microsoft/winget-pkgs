  ðŸ§ª Experiments Added
  Introduction of the auto-provider-cache-dir experiment
  The new auto-provider-cache-dir experiment has been added to automatically configure OpenTofu provider caching when certain conditions are met:
  - You are using OpenTofu
  - You are using a version of OpenTofu >= 1.10
  This leverages recent improvements in how OpenTofu handles provider caching to allow for safe concurrent access to provider plugins in OpenTofu 1.10.
  In micro-benchmarks, the native provider cache directory out-performs the Provider Cache Server, as the overhead of starting and running the provider cache server is eliminated.

  Once generally available, this feature will be enabled by default, automatically providing performance improvements to Terragrunt users using OpenTofu >= 1.10. If you are currently using the Provider Cache Server, you are advised to experiment with this feature, and share your feedback.
  You can learn more about the feature in the dedicated feature docs, including a comparison with the Provider Cache Server, so you can learn if limitations in how the native OpenTofu provider cache directory will result in a requirement to continue using the Provider Cache Server going forward.
  Special thanks to @cam72cam for coordinating with us to get this long-awaited feature supported in OpenTofu to meet the needs of the IaC community.
  âœ¨ New Features
  --version-manager-file-name Flag Added
  During a run --all, Terragrunt memoizes the version of OpenTofu/Terraform being run to determine if version constraints are being satisfied, without doing unnecessary work to repeatedly check the version of OpenTofu/Terraform being run in each directory.
  To ensure that users using tool managers are able to leverage different versions of OpenTofu/Terraform in different directories, the cache key for this memoization includes calculations based on common version manager tools.
  By default, the following are detected:
  - .terraform-version
  - .tool-versions
  - .mise.toml
  - mise.toml
  To support the usage of any arbitrary tool manager, a new --version-manager-file-name flag has been introduced to allow configurability over this list.
  To learn more about --version-manager-file-name read the docs.
