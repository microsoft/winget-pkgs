ReleaseNotes: |-
  ✨ New Features
  Support for OpenTofu 1.10 Native S3 Locking
  The remote_state S3 backend now integrates natively with the OpenTofu 1.10 feature of state locking via S3 without the usage of DynamoDB using the new use_lockfile attribute.
  # Configure OpenTofu/Terraform state to be stored in S3 with native S3 locking instead of DynamoDB.
  # This uses S3 object conditional writes for state locking, which requires OpenTofu >= 1.10.
  remote_state {
    backend = "s3"
    config = {
      bucket       = "my-tofu-state"
      key          = "${path_relative_to_include()}/tofu.tfstate"
      region       = "us-east-1"
      encrypt      = true
      use_lockfile = true
    }
  }
  In previous releases, if users wanted to integrate with this OpenTofu feature, they would have to use the generate attribute, which opts users out of more advanced features of Terragrunt remote state management like automatic provisioning of state resources.
  By using the native attribute in config, users can retain the benefits of automatic backend bootstrapping in addition to native integration with the new OpenTofu feature.
  You can learn more about backend configurations in the HCL docs.
