ReleaseNotes: |-
  üí™üèΩ Enhancements
  The run --all command automatically generates Terragrunt Stacks
  If you are using terragrunt.stack.hcl files in your codebase, run --all commands will now automatically expand all terragrunt.stack.hcl files into generated stack configurations, as if you had run stack generate before running the run --all command.
  e.g.
  terragrunt run --all plan
  Is now equivalent to:
  terragrunt stack generate
  terragrunt run --all plan
  If you would like to disable this new behavior, you can use the --no-stack-generate to opt out of automatic stack generation.
  üìñ Docs Updates
  The Terragrunt v1 docs are open for feedback!
  These docs will undergo significant adjustments, both stylistically, and functionality on the road to 1.0.
  They are a full rewrite of the existing Terragrunt Docs site written in Jekyll to one using Starlight.
  Your feedback is requested! If you are reading these release notes relatively soon after release, you should see a link at the top of the site where you can provide your feedback on the new docs.
