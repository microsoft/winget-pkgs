ReleaseNotes: |-
  Removal of deprecated commands
  This is the next step on the road to Terragrunt 1.0, completing the Terragrunt CLI Redesign. Read the CLI Redesign migration guide for guidance on adapting to these breaking changes.
  We anticipate no further breaking changes to the CLI prior to the release of Terragrunt 1.0, where the CLI will remain stable without breaking changes until at least Terragrunt 2.0.
  For a full list of deprecated features that will be removed prior to the release of Terragrunt 1.0, see the removal schedule.
