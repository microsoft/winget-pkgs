ShortDescription: Graphviz is open source graph visualization software. Graph visualization is a way of representing structural information as diagrams of abstract graphs and networks.
Description: |-
  The Graphviz layout programs take descriptions of graphs in a simple text language, and make diagrams in useful formats, such as images and SVG for web pages; PDF or Postscript for inclusion in other documents; or display in an interactive graph browser.
  Graphviz has many useful features for concrete diagrams, such as options for colors, fonts, tabular node layouts, line styles, hyperlinks, and custom shapes.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Added
  - Support for building the SWIG-generated Guile language bindings has been integrated into the CMake build system. This is controllable by the -DENABLE_GUILE={AUTO|ON|OFF} option.
  - Support for building the SWIG-generated Java language bindings has been integrated into the CMake build system. This is controllable by the -DENABLE_JAVA={AUTO|ON|OFF} option.
  - Support for building the SWIG-generated Lua language bindings has been integrated into the CMake build system. This is controllable by the -DENABLE_LUA={AUTO|ON|OFF} option.
  - Support for building the SWIG-generated Perl language bindings has been integrated into the CMake build system. This is controllable by the -DENABLE_PERL={AUTO|ON|OFF} option.
  Changed
  - Comparison against a plugin’s knowncolors array is now case-insensitive, rather than requiring all entries of the array to be lower-cased. The requirement that the knowncolors array is lexically ordered remains.
  - The Smyrna “Color Theme”, “Edge Attr. For Color”, and “Node Alpha” settings have been removed. The values of these settings had no effect.
  - Graphviz libraries set close-on-exec on job output files being written and user shape files being read. This should only affect applications using Graphviz libraries that rely on a fork-and-exec-ed child subprocess being able to access these open files. Applications with this requirement can regain the old behavior by unsetting the close-on-exec flag immediately after creating these objects. Graphviz libraries themselves are not affected by whether or not this flag is set.
  - The Autotools build system no longer detects or uses the -perl option to SWIG to build Perl language bindings. Only -perl5 is used.
  Fixed
  - A reference to the non-existent colxlate function in an error message has been corrected to colorxlate.
  - gvgen no longer crashes sometimes when running random graph generation. This was a regression in Graphviz 12.0.0. #2588
  - Dashed and dotted pen styles in VRML images loaded by the GD plugin have been corrected.
  - mm2gv no longer crashes when reading various types of malformed Matrix Market files.
  - The edgepaint --color_scheme command-line option is once again functional. This was a regression in Graphviz 2.49.0. #2591
  - An incorrect deallocation call during OpenGL texture construction failure has been corrected. This could previously have caused crashes or heap corruption. This was a regression in Graphviz 2.26.0.
  - The CMake build on Windows no longer fails if TCL is detected. This was technically a regression in 12.0.0 since building the Graphviz TCL bindings was integrated into the CMake build system in that release. #2581
  - When its output file cannot be opened, edgepaint no longer dereferences a null pointer when printing its error message.
