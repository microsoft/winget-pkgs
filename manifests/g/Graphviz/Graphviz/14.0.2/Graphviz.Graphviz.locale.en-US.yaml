ShortDescription: Graphviz is open source graph visualization software. Graph visualization is a way of representing structural information as diagrams of abstract graphs and networks.
Description: |-
  The Graphviz layout programs take descriptions of graphs in a simple text language, and make diagrams in useful formats, such as images and SVG for web pages; PDF or Postscript for inclusion in other documents; or display in an interactive graph browser.
  Graphviz has many useful features for concrete diagrams, such as options for colors, fonts, tabular node layouts, line styles, hyperlinks, and custom shapes.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Changed
  - Quartz plugin code paths to support older macOS and iOS versions have been restored. Their removal was a regression in Graphviz 13.0.0.
  - In the CMake build system, whether Quartz-dependent components are built or not can now be controlled by the -DWITH_QUARTZ={AUTO|ON|OFF} option.
  - dot_builtins, when compiled with the CMake build system, now supports the Quartz plugin if it is enabled at build time.
  Fixed
  - Memory corruption when using the Java bindings to render to a string has been corrected. This was a regression in Graphviz 2.49.0.
  - A minor typo in the gvpr(3) man page has been fixed.
  - Calling gvpr(…, NULL) no longer causes null pointer dereferences.
