ShortDescription: Graphviz is open source graph visualization software. Graph visualization is a way of representing structural information as diagrams of abstract graphs and networks.
Description: |-
  The Graphviz layout programs take descriptions of graphs in a simple text language, and make diagrams in useful formats, such as images and SVG for web pages; PDF or Postscript for inclusion in other documents; or display in an interactive graph browser.
  Graphviz has many useful features for concrete diagrams, such as options for colors, fonts, tabular node layouts, line styles, hyperlinks, and custom shapes.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Changed
  - When using the CMake build system, the minimum required version of CMake has been upgraded 3.14.1 â†’ 3.21.
  - Building Graphviz from source now requires a C compiler with ISO C17 support.
  - Processing a graph with GVPR now makes explicit the default "\N" label for nodes.
  Fixed
  - Graphs with large weights no longer trigger double frees. #1494, #2331
  - nop preserves empty string labels. #2436
  - The order of programmatic calls to gvContext/gvContextPlugin and agmemread no longer affects default node labels. #2434
  - Adjacency matrices are sparse and expanded on demand, removing out-of-bounds accesses when computing these for some graphs. #1472
