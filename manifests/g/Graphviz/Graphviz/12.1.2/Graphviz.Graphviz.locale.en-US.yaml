ShortDescription: Graphviz is open source graph visualization software. Graph visualization is a way of representing structural information as diagrams of abstract graphs and networks.
Description: |-
  The Graphviz layout programs take descriptions of graphs in a simple text language, and make diagrams in useful formats, such as images and SVG for web pages; PDF or Postscript for inclusion in other documents; or display in an interactive graph browser.
  Graphviz has many useful features for concrete diagrams, such as options for colors, fonts, tabular node layouts, line styles, hyperlinks, and custom shapes.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Changed
  - In the Autotools build system, the rsvg plugin is no longer built when pangocairo is missing. Previously, when librsvg was found but pangocairo was not, this plugin would be enabled and built but offer no functionality.
  - The RSVG plugin now requires librsvg â‰¥ 2.42.7.
  - The RSVG plugin uses newer librsvg APIs where available. #2206
  Fixed
  - In the Autotools build system, fallback discovery of libANN when pkg-config support is unavailable has been corrected to properly enable use of libANN. This primarily affects mingle users on Debian-based operating systems or macOS.
  - The RSVG plugin no longer dereferences a null pointer when failing to create new RSVG handles.
  - The Pango plugin no longer assumes a little endian environment when loading PS images.
