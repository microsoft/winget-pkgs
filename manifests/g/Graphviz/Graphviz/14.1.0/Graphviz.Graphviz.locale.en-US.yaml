ShortDescription: Graphviz is open source graph visualization software. Graph visualization is a way of representing structural information as diagrams of abstract graphs and networks.
Description: |-
  The Graphviz layout programs take descriptions of graphs in a simple text language, and make diagrams in useful formats, such as images and SVG for web pages; PDF or Postscript for inclusion in other documents; or display in an interactive graph browser.
  Graphviz has many useful features for concrete diagrams, such as options for colors, fonts, tabular node layouts, line styles, hyperlinks, and custom shapes.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Added
  - Added option neato -n3 for fit ends of edges to nodes' borders when edge trajectory is set. #2736
  - Orthogonal edges now support rounded corners via the radius edge attribute. When splines=ortho is set and an edge has radius > 0, corners are rendered as smooth arcs instead of sharp angles. The radius value controls the size of the corner arc. Default is 0 (square corners).
  Fixed
  - Some Undefined Behavior in sparse matrix calculations has been removed.
  - In the Autotools build system, when the PHP interpreter (php) is available but php-config is not, building the PHP bindings is no longer enabled. This was a regression in Graphviz 2.42.0. #2788
