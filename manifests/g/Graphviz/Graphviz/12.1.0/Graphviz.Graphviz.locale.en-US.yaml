ShortDescription: Open source graph visualization software
Description: |-
  Graphviz is open source graph visualization software. Graph visualization is a way of representing structural information as diagrams of abstract graphs and networks. It has important applications in networking, bioinformatics, software engineering, database and web design, machine learning, and in visual interfaces for other technical domains.
  The Graphviz layout programs take descriptions of graphs in a simple text language, and make diagrams in useful formats, such as images and SVG for web pages; PDF or Postscript for inclusion in other documents; or display in an interactive graph browser. Graphviz has many useful features for concrete diagrams, such as options for colors, fonts, tabular node layouts, line styles, hyperlinks, and custom shapes.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Added
  - Enable the GNU Triangulated Surface Library (GTS) in Windows builds. #2557
  - dot_builtins now also includes the vt plugin (-Tvt output format).
  - The vt plugin gained new output formats, -Tvt-4up, -Tvt-6up, and -Tvt-8up, for drawing monochrome 4-, 6-, and 8-pixel-per-character visualizations, respectively.
  - The CMake build system now includes the WebP plugin also on Windows.
  - A Windows x64 mingle binary is now built with CMake.
  - Support for building the SWIG-generated D language bindings has been integrated into the CMake build system. This is controllable by the -DENABLE_D={AUTO|ON|OFF} option.
  - Support for building the SWIG-generated Go language bindings has been integrated into the CMake build system. This is controllable by the -DENABLE_GO={AUTO|ON|OFF} option. The target integer size can be set with -DINTGOSIZE=… if it is not auto-detected correctly.
  - Support for building the SWIG-generated JavaScript language bindings has been integrated into the CMake build system. This is controllable by the -DENABLE_JAVASCRIPT={AUTO|ON|OFF} option.
  Changed
  - The GTK plugin, for which build system support was removed in Graphviz 10.0.1, has been removed from the portable source tarball. #1848
  - To build from source, the required C++ standard has been upgraded from C11 to C17. #2536
  - Breaking: the CMake variables enable_ltdl, with_expat, with_gvedit, with_smyrna, with_zlib, enable_tcl, enable_swig and enable_sharp have been renamed to ENABLE_LTDL, WITH_EXPAT, WITH_GVEDIT, WITH_SMYRNA, WITH_ZLIB, ENABLE_TCL, ENABLE_SWIG and ENABLE_SHARP, respectively.
  - To build from source, the required Python version has been upgraded from 3.6 to 3.8. #2549
  - Build system discovery of GDK now looks for GDK 3.0 instead of GDK 2.0. #1848
  - Visual Studio build files are no longer distributed in the portable source tarball. Builds on Windows must now use a repository clone.
  Fixed
  - ccomps, gc, the fdp layout engine, the neato layout engine, and the patchwork algorithm now understand a cluster to be indicated by the common rules, including the “cluster” prefix being case insensitive and the cluster=true attribute as an alternative. #2187
  - overlap values whose prefixes are themselves valid values (e.g. overlap=scalexy where overlap=scale is also a valid setting) are once again usable. Previously such values would silently select the shortest valid prefix. This was a regression in Graphviz 2.24.0. #2563
  - Setting overlap=ortho_xy no longer also runs the constraint pass of overlap=porthoxy. Setting overlap=ortho no longer also runs the constraint passes of overlap=ortho_xy and ortho=porthoxy. This bug has existed ever since these overlap modes were introduced in Graphviz 2.4. However its effect was masked by the bug discussed in the prior CHANGELOG entry that made it not possible to select overlap=ortho_xy or overlap=porthoxy.
  - splines = true merging multiedges together when using the neato engine. #2241 (fixed on Windows by enabling GTS)
  - The GVC output writing APIs handle writes of compressed data > UINT_MAX more correctly.
  - GVPR casts of strings to floats now produce the expected values. This was a regression in Graphviz 2.30.
  - CMake builds do not support format png:gd #1786
  - The diffimg utility is not built in CMake builds #1788 (fixed also for Windows x64 builds)
  - The Windows x86 mingle binary built with CMake no longer fails to start because of missing ANN.dll.
  - The node and edge tags printed by the TK output format (-Ttk) are once again usable for later referencing those same nodes and edges in TCL scripting. This was likely broken in the transition from 32-bit to 64-bit hardware. #2568
  - Ubuntu 24.04 binaries incorrectly are ASan enabled and produce memory leak errors. #2574
  - gvpr’s ability to handle empty string parameters to printf (e.g. printf("hello%s world", "")) has been restored. This was a regression in Graphviz 9.0.0. #2577
  - pkgIndex.tcl for the TCL bindings is constructed based on target system properties instead of host system properties. Previously, cross-compilation would result in potentially incorrect library loading directives in this file.
  - The Autotools build system no longer checks for the presence of php.h, which previously caused spurious failures when trying to build the PHP bindings with PHP 8.3. #2589
  - A gvmap crash due to out-of-bounds memory writes has been fixed. This was a regression in Graphviz 8.0.1.
