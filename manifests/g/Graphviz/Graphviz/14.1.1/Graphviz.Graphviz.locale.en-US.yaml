ShortDescription: Graphviz is open source graph visualization software. Graph visualization is a way of representing structural information as diagrams of abstract graphs and networks.
Description: |-
  The Graphviz layout programs take descriptions of graphs in a simple text language, and make diagrams in useful formats, such as images and SVG for web pages; PDF or Postscript for inclusion in other documents; or display in an interactive graph browser.
  Graphviz has many useful features for concrete diagrams, such as options for colors, fonts, tabular node layouts, line styles, hyperlinks, and custom shapes.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Changed
  - When seeding random number generators with time(NULL), the result of getpid() is no longer also mixed in. Previously this was the case on non-Windows platforms, impeding reproducibility and portability.
  Fixed
  - In the CMake build system, when WITH_SMYRNA is AUTO or unset, Smyrna enabling depends on the presence of Pangocairo.
  - In the CMake build system, versions of dot with plugins built in are only linked against enabled plugins. #2795
