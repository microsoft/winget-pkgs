ShortDescription: Graphviz is open source graph visualization software. Graph visualization is a way of representing structural information as diagrams of abstract graphs and networks.
Description: |-
  The Graphviz layout programs take descriptions of graphs in a simple text language, and make diagrams in useful formats, such as images and SVG for web pages; PDF or Postscript for inclusion in other documents; or display in an interactive graph browser.
  Graphviz has many useful features for concrete diagrams, such as options for colors, fonts, tabular node layouts, line styles, hyperlinks, and custom shapes.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Changed
  - Internal timing operations now use clock() on all platforms (previously this was only used on Windows). This should result in more accurate timing in verbose informational messages.
  - Building Graphviz with expat < 2.2.8 is no longer supported on MinGW.
  Fixed
  - diffimg now notices failures when calling Ghostscript to convert PS images to PNG and exits instead of continuing.
  - dtstat no longer reads/writes out of bounds memory on platforms where sizeof(int) < sizeof(size_t). This was a regression in Graphviz 7.0.1.
  - Some incorrect variable types in the libcdt man page have been corrected.
  - gvgen no longer triggers Undefined Behavior when asked to generate a binary tree with depth ≥ 32 (e.g. gvgen -t32).
  - gvgen no longer triggers Undefined Behavior when asked to generate a hypercube with depth ≥ 32 (e.g. gvgen -h32).
  - A null pointer dereference in edge pair analysis within the circo algorithm has been fixed.
