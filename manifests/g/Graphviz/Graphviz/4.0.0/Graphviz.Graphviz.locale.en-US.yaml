ShortDescription: Graphviz is open source graph visualization software. Graph visualization is a way of representing structural information as diagrams of abstract graphs and networks.
Description: The Graphviz layout programs take descriptions of graphs in a simple text language, and make diagrams in useful formats, such as images and SVG for web pages; PDF or Postscript for inclusion in other documents; or display in an interactive graph browser. Graphviz has many useful features for concrete diagrams, such as options for colors, fonts, tabular node layouts, line styles, hyperlinks, and custom shapes.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Changed
  • Breaking: The mark field of the Agnodeinfo_t struct is now a size_t instead of a char.
  • Breaking: The unused shape_t struct has been removed from the public header types.h
  • Breaking: The Agiodisc_t struct member putstr that was previously an fputs analog is replaced by printf that is required to behave similar to fprintf.
  • the mingle, diffimg, gvmap, and edgepaint binaries are now included in the CMake build system
  • the gvmap.sh and vimdot scripts are now installed by the CMake build system on operating systems other than Windows
  • a brief note about the (previously undocumented) behavior of Graphviz when sent SIGUSR1 is now mentioned in the man page
  • build system support for dotty, lefty, and lneato has been removed
  • the CMake build system now includes the DevIL, GDK, GhostScript, GTK, LASi, Poppler, Quartz, Rsvg, Visio, WebP, and Xlib plugins
  • awk is no longer a build-time dependency #2118

  Fixed
  • agcanon, agcanonStr, and agwrite now return error values on memory allocation failures instead of crashing or corrupting data
  • gvpr programs can now pass dynamically allocated arguments to user-defined functions without corrupting their content. Some cases of this were a regression in Graphviz 2.46.0. Other cases have existed since the first release of gvpr. #2185
  • spurious "no hard-coded metrics" warnings on labels with empty lines #2179
  • fixed corruption of user shape characteristics during EPSF initialization
  • output formats canon, dot, and xdot are not completely faithful to input #2184
  • gvpr index function produces wrong results #2211. This was a regression in Graphviz 2.47.0.
  • Error on more than 128 cluster subgraphs #2080
  • dot2gxl no longer crashes on input <node id=""> #2092
  • remove itos #2229
  • sfdp no longer crashes on certain graphs with cycles. #2225
  • gml2gv does not handle integer penwidth correctly #1871

  Removed
  • the glitz plugin has been removed. The plugin was never complete and distributions no longer ship glitz.
