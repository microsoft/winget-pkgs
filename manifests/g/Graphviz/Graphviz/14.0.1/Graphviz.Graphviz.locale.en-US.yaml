ShortDescription: Graphviz is open source graph visualization software. Graph visualization is a way of representing structural information as diagrams of abstract graphs and networks.
Description: |-
  The Graphviz layout programs take descriptions of graphs in a simple text language, and make diagrams in useful formats, such as images and SVG for web pages; PDF or Postscript for inclusion in other documents; or display in an interactive graph browser.
  Graphviz has many useful features for concrete diagrams, such as options for colors, fonts, tabular node layouts, line styles, hyperlinks, and custom shapes.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Changed
  - The pre-built macOS package for Autotools is now a .pkg file instead of a tarball of binaries. #2726, !4348
  - In the CMake build system, whether Ghostscript-dependent components are built or not can now be controlled by the -DWITH_GHOSTSCRIPT={AUTO|ON|OFF} option. #2735
  Fixed
  - Points generated as curves by the dot layout algorithm are once again placed correctly. This was a regression in Graphviz 14.0.0. #2734
