ShortDescription: Graphviz is open source graph visualization software. Graph visualization is a way of representing structural information as diagrams of abstract graphs and networks.
Description: |-
  The Graphviz layout programs take descriptions of graphs in a simple text language, and make diagrams in useful formats, such as images and SVG for web pages; PDF or Postscript for inclusion in other documents; or display in an interactive graph browser.
  Graphviz has many useful features for concrete diagrams, such as options for colors, fonts, tabular node layouts, line styles, hyperlinks, and custom shapes.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Added
  - Support for building the SWIG-generated R language bindings has been integrated into the CMake build system. This is controllable by the -DENABLE_R={AUTO|ON|OFF} option.
  - A sandboxing wrapper, dot_sandbox, is now included with Graphviz. Users should prefer their platform’s native security solutions, but if nothing better is available this wrapper offers safe processing of untrusted inputs in some scenarios.
  Changed
  - JPEG images without an APP0 leading segment are supported for use in src fields and friends. Previously Graphviz was overly strict with the types of JPEGs it would recognize. #2619
  Fixed
  - The GVPR library program depath no longer acts on previously deleted nodes, causing unpredictable results. #1702
  - Void-typed function parameters (int foo(void bar)) and variables void baz; in GVPR are gracefully rejected. #2585
  - Input that induce a set node height but no set node width no longer crash with the failure “Assertion failed: (r->boundary[i] <= r->boundary[NUMDIMS + i]), function RTreeInsert”. It is typically not obvious to users when their input falls into this situation, hence why the assertion message is quoted here. This was a regression in Graphviz 12.0.0. #2613
  - Strings containing double quote characters preceded by escape sequences (e.g. \n") are once again correctly escaped in dot or canonical output. This was a regression in Graphviz 9.0.0. #2614
  - dot_builtins no longer lists duplicate format options in its error messages. #2604
  - A precision error that resulted in truncated edge lines has been corrected. This was a regression in Graphviz 12.0.0. #2620
  - The xlib plugin (-Tx11) resets its initialization state during finalization. This fixes a rare scenario where multiple input graphs are supplied and initialization for one of the not-first graphs fails. In this scenario, finalization would be unaware of this failure and act on invalid state.
