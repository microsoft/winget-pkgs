ShortDescription: Graphviz is open source graph visualization software. Graph visualization is a way of representing structural information as diagrams of abstract graphs and networks.
Description: The Graphviz layout programs take descriptions of graphs in a simple text language, and make diagrams in useful formats, such as images and SVG for web pages; PDF or Postscript for inclusion in other documents; or display in an interactive graph browser. Graphviz has many useful features for concrete diagrams, such as options for colors, fonts, tabular node layouts, line styles, hyperlinks, and custom shapes.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Changed
  • Breaking: Using Graphviz as a library on Windows now requires the GVDLL symbol to be set to ensure correct linking.
  • Breaking: Graphviz headers no longer define the boolean type. A replacement is C99 bool in the C standard library’s stdbool.h.
  • Breaking: The insidefn member of the shape_functions struct must now be a pointer to a function returning a C99 bool instead of a Graphviz-specific boolean.
  • Breaking: The swapEnds and splineMerge members of the splineInfo struct must now be pointers to functions returning a C99 bools instead of Graphviz-specific booleans. Similarly the ignoreSwap and isOrtho members of this struct must now be C99 bools instead of a Graphviz-specific booleans.
  • Breaking: The defined, constrained, clip, and dyna fields of the port struct are now C99 bools instead of Graphviz-specific booleans.
  • Breaking: The set and html fields of the textlabel_t struct are now C99 bools instead of Graphviz-specific booleans.
  • Breaking: The usershape field of the shape_desc struct is now a C99 bool instead of a Graphviz-specific boolean.
  • Breaking: The candidate and valid fields of the rank_t struct are now C99 bools instead of Graphviz-specific booleans.
  • Breaking: The filled, landscape, and centered fields of the layout_t struct are now C99 bools instead of Graphviz-specific booleans.
  • Breaking: The has_images, has_flat_edges, has_sourcerank, has_sinkrank, expanded, and exact_ranksep fields of the Agraphinfo_t struct are now C99 bools instead of Graphviz-specific booleans.
  • Breaking: The clustnode and has_port fields of the Agnodeinfo_t struct are now C99 bools instead of Graphviz-specific booleans.
  • Breaking: The conc_opp_flag field of the Agedgeinfo_t struct is now a C99 bool instead of a Graphviz-specific boolean.
  • Breaking: The must_inline and nocache fields of the usershape_t struct are now C99 bools instead of Graphviz-specific booleans.
  • Breaking: The device_sets_dpi, external_context, fit_mode, needs_refresh, click, has_grown, and has_been_rendered fields of the GVJ_t struct are now C99 bools instead of Graphviz-specific booleans.
  • Breaking: The loadimage member of the gvloadimage_engine_t struct must now accept a C99 bool parameter instead of a former Graphviz-specific boolean parameter.
  • Breaking: The textlayout member of the gvtextlayout_engine_t struct must now return a C99 bool instead of a Graphviz-specific boolean.
  • Breaking: The config and auto_outfile_names members of the GVC_common_s struct are now C99 bools instead of Graphviz-specific booleans.
  • Breaking: The fixed member of the pack_info struct is now an array of C99 bools instead of an array of Graphviz-specific booleans. Similarly, pack_graph now takes a bool array instead of a boolean array.
  • Breaking: pccomps now takes a C99 bool instead of a boolean output parameter.
  • Breaking: gvusershape_file_access now returns a C99 bool instead of a Graphviz-specific boolean.
  • Breaking: 1-bit fields of the obj_state_s struct are now unsigned instead of signed.
  • Breaking: Graphviz headers no longer define the constant MAXSHORT. A drop-in replacement is SHRT_MAX in the C standard library’s limits.h.
  • Breaking: Graphviz headers no lnger define NIL macros. A drop-in replacement is NULL in the C standard library’s stddef.h.
  • Breaking: Graphviz headers no longer define the NOT macro. A drop-in replacement is the C/C++ operator !.
  • Breaking: Graphviz headers no longer (re-)define the C constants INT_MIN and INT_MAX. Replacements can be found in the C standard library’s limits.h.
  • Breaking: Graphviz headers no longer define the constant _DUMMY_ELEM.
  • Breaking: The -m memory test option to Graphviz command-line programs has been deprecated. Tools such as Leak Sanitizer are a more effective modern way of diagnosing memory safety issues.
  • Breaking: Graphviz headers no longer define the constant MAXFLOAT. A replacement is FLT_MAX in the C standard library’s float.h.
  • The Ming plugin that produced Shockwave files has been removed. This format was EOLed by Adobe in April 2019. #2160
  • CentOS 7 packages now include libmingle and the mingle program.
  • The tclpkg Makefile no longer suppresses -fstack-clash-protection nor other compiler options containing -x
  • Lefty is no longer enabled in the portable source tarball.
  • on Linux, the CMake build system uses the standard GNUInstallDirs to locate target installation paths
