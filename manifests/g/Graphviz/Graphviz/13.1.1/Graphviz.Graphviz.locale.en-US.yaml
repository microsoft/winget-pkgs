ShortDescription: Graphviz is open source graph visualization software. Graph visualization is a way of representing structural information as diagrams of abstract graphs and networks.
Description: |-
  The Graphviz layout programs take descriptions of graphs in a simple text language, and make diagrams in useful formats, such as images and SVG for web pages; PDF or Postscript for inclusion in other documents; or display in an interactive graph browser.
  Graphviz has many useful features for concrete diagrams, such as options for colors, fonts, tabular node layouts, line styles, hyperlinks, and custom shapes.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Changed
  - When built with PangoCairo, the Kitty plugin is now available in Graphviz static builds. Previously it was only available in shared library (on-demand plugin loading) builds.
  - The distributed Fedora and Rocky Linux packages now include the Kitty plugin. #2704
  - On Windows, the GDI+ plugin is now available in Graphviz static builds. Previously it was only available in shared library (on-demand plugin loading) builds.
  - Processing a graph with GVPR no longer makes explicit the default "\N" label for nodes. This undoes a change from Graphviz 13.0.1. #2705
  - nop no longer preserves empty string labels. This undoes a change from Graphviz 13.0.1. #2436, #2705
  - The order of programmatic calls to gvContext/gvContextPlugin and agmemread once again affects default node labels. This undoes a change from Graphviz 13.0.1. #2434, #2705
  Fixed
  - Spline routing can now deal with horizontal and vertical lines. This removes some instances of the “Something is probably seriously wrong” warning. #241
  - Using layerselect beyond layer 1 no longer causes crashes. #1648
  - Correct parsing of a PDF file’s /MediaBox section no longer depends on the internal BUFSIZ constant.
  - Round tripping a graph through a file no longer causes it to acquire a default node label \N. #2705
