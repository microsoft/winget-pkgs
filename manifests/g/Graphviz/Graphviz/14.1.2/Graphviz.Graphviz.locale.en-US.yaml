ShortDescription: Open source graph visualization software
Description: |-
  Graphviz is open source graph visualization software. Graph visualization is a way of representing structural information as diagrams of abstract graphs and networks. It has important applications in networking, bioinformatics, software engineering, database and web design, machine learning, and in visual interfaces for other technical domains.
  The Graphviz layout programs take descriptions of graphs in a simple text language, and make diagrams in useful formats, such as images and SVG for web pages; PDF or Postscript for inclusion in other documents; or display in an interactive graph browser. Graphviz has many useful features for concrete diagrams, such as options for colors, fonts, tabular node layouts, line styles, hyperlinks, and custom shapes.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Changed
  - Support for HP-UX has been removed.
  Fixed
  - On MinGW, Smyrna consistently uses / as a path separator.
  - In the CMake build system, building a statically linked dot with the Quartz plugin enabled has been repaired.
  - The configuration files exported by the CMake build system have an additional install interface of include, adding to the existing include/graphviz. The effect of this is that code using these files to access Graphviz headers can now prefix their include paths, e.g. #include <graphviz/gvc.h> instead of #include <gvc.h>. #2798
  - The colorscheme attribute when applied to edge labels works once again. This was a regression in Graphviz 11.0.0. #2801
  - The dpi and resolution graph attributes are now constrained to a minimum value of 0.0. This was already stated in the documentation but not enforced by the code.
  - Compilation from source no longer fails on Solaris with symbol conflicts due to lock_t usage. #2802
  - When compiling Graphviz from source, _FILE_OFFSET_BITS is set consistently in all compilation jobs. #2803
