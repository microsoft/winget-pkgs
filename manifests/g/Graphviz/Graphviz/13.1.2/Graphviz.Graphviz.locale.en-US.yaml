ShortDescription: Graphviz is open source graph visualization software. Graph visualization is a way of representing structural information as diagrams of abstract graphs and networks.
Description: |-
  The Graphviz layout programs take descriptions of graphs in a simple text language, and make diagrams in useful formats, such as images and SVG for web pages; PDF or Postscript for inclusion in other documents; or display in an interactive graph browser.
  Graphviz has many useful features for concrete diagrams, such as options for colors, fonts, tabular node layouts, line styles, hyperlinks, and custom shapes.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Changed
  - DFLT_GVPRPATH, a $PATH-like variable that gvpr uses to locate user-referenced files, is now computed at runtime instead of build time. This removes a barrier to relocating a Graphviz installation from one directory to another.
  - In the CMake build system, whether GDK-dependent components are built or not can now be controlled by the -DWITH_GDK={AUTO|ON|OFF} option. #2714
  Fixed
  - Gvedit and Smyrna on MinGW can now correctly locate their supporting runtime data directories.
  - The gvpr options -v for printing verbose messages is documented. This has been supported since Graphviz 2.30 but undocumented.
  - When using the CMake build system, DFLT_GVPRPATH is no longer incorrectly missing a ".:" prefix.
  - On macOS, processing graphs involving URLs with the Quartz plugin is once again possible. Previously this would crash. This was a regression in Graphviz 13.0.1. #2712
  - In gvpr, updating a map or deleting items from the map no longer triggers a use-after-free. #2707
