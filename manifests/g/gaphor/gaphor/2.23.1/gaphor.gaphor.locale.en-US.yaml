ShortDescription: Gaphor is the simple modeling tool
Description: |-
  Gaphor is a UML and SysML modeling application written in Python.
  It is designed to be easy to use, while still being powerful.
  Gaphor implements a fully-compliant UML 2 data model, so it is much more than a picture drawing tool.
  You can use Gaphor to quickly visualize different aspects of a system as well as create complete, highly complex models.
