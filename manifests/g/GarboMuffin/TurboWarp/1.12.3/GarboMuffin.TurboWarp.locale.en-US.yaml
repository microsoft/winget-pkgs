  If you're wondering what happened to 1.12.2: When publishing 1.12.1 to the Mac App Store I realized that Rich Presence does not work there (because the Mac App Store sandbox is extra strict) and made some extra changes to disable the option there. That build was assigned version 1.12.2 even though no full release was made. Apple requires a new version number for each release, so I had to increase the number.
