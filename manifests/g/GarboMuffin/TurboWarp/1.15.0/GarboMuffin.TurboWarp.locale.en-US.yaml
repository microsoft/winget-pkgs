ReleaseNotes: |-
  - New compiler runs some projects twice as fast
  - Added face sensing extension. It uses a machine learning model that runs on your computer, so it works offline. Your webcam feed is never uploaded to any server
  - Local storage extension no longer requires manually configuring namespace
  - Newgrounds extension significantly improved
  - Fixed "Unexpected status 503" errors when packaging certain projects
  - Windows: Fixed broken text boxes after choosing "Stay" in the unsaved changes confirmation dialog
  - macOS: Fixed poor performance on macOS 26
  - macOS: macOS 11 users now have to use a special legacy version of the app which is slower and less secure than the regular version
  - Linux: If you use a Wayland compositor, the app will now use native Wayland instead of the Xwayland compatibility layer
  - Linux: Changed executable name back to "turbowarp-desktop" after unintentional change in previous update
  - GitHub releases are now marked as immutable which prevents them from being changed after release to improve security
