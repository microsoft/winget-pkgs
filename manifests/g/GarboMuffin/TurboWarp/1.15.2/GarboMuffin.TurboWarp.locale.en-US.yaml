ReleaseNotes: |-
  - v1.15.1 was never broadly released so for most people, this would also include everything in it
  - Fixed the camera extension not working in general
  - Made packaged projects about 50KB smaller
  - Windows: We are no longer publishing updates to winget ourselves due to a persistent series of errors and several security risks in the current automation workflow. We don't think anyone actually uses winget. If you do, we'll start publishing there again if you can figure out why the last three releases all hit validation errors and implement automation that at least tries to not be insecure
