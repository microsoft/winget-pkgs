  Overview
  Drip v0.6.3 introduces HTTP Proxy Authentication and enhanced IP Access Control, providing more granular security controls for your tunnels.
  What's New
  Proxy Authentication
  Secure your HTTP tunnels with password protection. When enabled, visitors must authenticate before accessing your tunneled service.
  - Password-protected tunnels - Add --auth <password> flag to require authentication
  - Cookie-based sessions - Authenticated users stay logged in via secure cookies
  - Clean login page - Built-in login UI for seamless user experience
  - XSS protection - HTML escaping implemented to prevent cross-site scripting attacks
  Usage:
  drip http 8080 --auth mysecretpassword
  Enhanced IP Access Control
  Extended IP filtering capabilities with CIDR range support.
  - CIDR range blocking - Block entire IP ranges instead of individual IPs
  - Flexible blacklisting - Support for both single IPs and CIDR notation (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24)
  Usage:
  drip http 8080 --blacklist 10.0.0.0/8,192.168.0.0/16
  Server Improvements
  - Configuration validation - Server now validates configuration on startup
  - Optimized connection handling - Improved connection lifecycle management
