ReleaseNotes: |-
  Flow Control & Reliability Improvements 🎯
  Features
  - Flow Control Protocol: New FlowControl frame type for backpressure
    control between client and server
  - SafeFrame: Automatic frame resource management ensures data is correctly
    returned to memory pool after use
  - Queue Pressure Monitoring: Client monitors dataFrameQueue length and
    automatically sends flow control commands when threshold exceeded
  - Server Backpressure: Added handleFlowControl and sendWithBackpressure
    methods for server-side flow control
  - Panic Recovery: New recovery package with Recoverer and PanicMetrics for
    goroutine panic capture and stack trace logging
  Performance
  - Faster Heartbeat: Reduced heartbeat interval from 5s to 2s, timeout from
    15s to 6s
  - Quicker Shutdown: Reduced forced shutdown wait time from 5s/3s to 2s for
    faster resource reclamation
  - Homepage Response: Converted HTML to byte slices with Content-Length
    header for improved response performance
  Stability
  - SafeFrame Lifecycle: Unified frame lifecycle management with defer
    sf.Close(), preventing memory leaks on abnormal paths
  - Delay Precision: Fixed delay formatting to correctly handle
    microsecond-level delays
