ReleaseNotes: |-
  🔧 Bug Fixes
  - TCP reconnect stability fix: Fixed an issue where subdomain and TCP port would change on client reconnect
    - Persist the assigned subdomain after first connect so reconnects reuse it
    - Allow reserving a specific TCP port when the subdomain is tcp-<port> to prevent port drift
  ⬆️ Upgrade Notes
  This release is fully backward compatible. After upgrading, TCP tunnels will maintain stable access addresses during reconnections caused by network fluctuations.
