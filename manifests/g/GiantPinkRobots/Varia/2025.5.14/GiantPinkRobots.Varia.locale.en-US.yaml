ShortDescription: Download manager based on aria2.

  Varia is a simple download manager. It uses the amazing aria2 to handle the downloads.
  It supports basic functionality like continuing incomplete downloads from the previous session upon startup, pausing/cancelling all downloads at once, setting a speed limit, authentication with a username/password, setting the simultaneous download amount and setting the download directory.
