ShortDescription: A diverse community uses GMT to process data, generate publication-quality illustrations, automate workflows, and make animations.
Description: GMT is an open-source collection of command-line tools for manipulating geographic and Cartesian data sets (including filtering, trend fitting, gridding, projecting, etc.) and producing high-quality illustrations ranging from simple xâ€“y plots via contour maps to artificially illuminated surfaces and 3D perspective views. It supports many map projections and transformations and includes supporting data such as coastlines, rivers, and political boundaries and optionally country polygons.
