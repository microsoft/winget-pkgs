Description: |-
  FocusWriter is a simple, distraction-free writing environment.
  It utilizes a hide-away interface that you access by moving your mouse to the edges of the screen, allowing the program to have a familiar look and feel to it while still getting out of the way so that you can immerse yourself in your work.
  It’s available for Linux and Windows, and has been translated into many different languages.
