ShortDescription: Fullscreen, highly customizable text editor.
Description: FocusWriter is a simple, distraction-free writing environment. It utilizes a hide-away interface that you access by moving your mouse to the edges of the screen, allowing the program to have a familiar look and feel to it while still getting out of the way so that you can immerse yourself in your work. Itâ€™s available for Linux and Windows, and has been translated into many different languages.
