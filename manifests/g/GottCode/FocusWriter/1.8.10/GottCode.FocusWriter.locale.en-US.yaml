  FocusWriter is a simple, distraction-free writing environment.
  It utilizes a hide-away interface that you access by moving your mouse to the edges of the screen, allowing the program to have a familiar look and feel to it while still getting out of the way so that you can immerse yourself in your work.
  Itâ€™s available for Linux and Windows, and has been translated into many different languages.
