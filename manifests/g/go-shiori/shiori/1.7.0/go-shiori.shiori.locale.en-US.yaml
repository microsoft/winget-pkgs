  Always remember to backup your data before updating.Notable changes
  System Theme (@Monirzadeh) #924
  Shiori now allows you to change the theme to light/dark or follow the system configuration.Screenshot 2024-06-03 at 13 19 39New migrations backend (@fmartingr) #876
  The underlying migrations system has been rewritten to custom code removing the go-migrate dependency.This not only removes one more dependency but also allows for more control over the migrations process by letting us add run code in a migration, for example, to update the database schema.This should be transparent for all users but if you find any problems please report itOpenBSD support (@pacoesteban) #780
  This has been in the works for several months since we broke it around 1.5 but thanks to the above migration changes and some custom database engine backend for OpenBSD, we are now able to support OpenBSD again. We added a CI step to get early warnings if we introduce something that breaks support.What's Changed
