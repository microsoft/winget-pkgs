ReleaseNotes: |-
  Features
  - Added a preview of the new Cloud Patches feature â€” engage in early collaboration before the pull request
    - Share your work with others by using gk patch create to create a Cloud Patch from your working changes, staged changes, or commits. Copy the generated link from the Cloud Patch list (gk patch list) and share with your teammates.
      - Cloud Patches are securely stored by GitKraken. Currently, anyone with access to the Cloud Patch link can view the changes, but link permissions are coming soon.
    - The new gk patch core command allows you to apply, view, list, and delete your Cloud Patches
  - Added the ability to Pin and Snooze items in the Focus view
    - Pin your PRs and issues to the top of your Focus view by using the p shortcut
    - Snooze your PRs and issues to move them to the 'Snoozed' section by using the s shortcut. To bring snoozed items back into view, simply visit the 'Snoozed' section and use the s shortcut to remove them from the snoozed state.
