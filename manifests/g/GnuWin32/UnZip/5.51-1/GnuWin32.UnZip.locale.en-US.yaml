ShortDescription: UnZip is an extraction utility for archives compressed in .zip format (also called "zipfiles").
Description: |-
  UnZip is an extraction utility for archives compressed in .zip format (also called "zipfiles"). Although highly compatible both with PKWARE's PKZIP and PKUNZIP utilities for MS-DOS and with Info-ZIP's own Zip program, our primary objectives have been portability and non-MSDOS functionality.
  UnZip will list, test, or extract files from a .zip archive, commonly found on MS-DOS systems. The default behavior (with no options) is to extract into the current directory (and subdirectories below it) all files from the specified zipfile. A companion program, Zip, creates .zip archives; both programs are compatible with archives created by PKZIP and PKUNZIP for MS-DOS, but in many cases the program options or default behaviors differ. (For example, UnZip recreates the stored directory structure by default; PKUNZIP unpacks all files in the current directory by default.)
