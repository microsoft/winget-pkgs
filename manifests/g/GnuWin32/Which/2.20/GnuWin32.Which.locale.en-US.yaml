ShortDescription: 'Which: show the full path of (shell) commands'
Description: |-
  Which takes one or more arguments. For each of its arguments it prints to stdout the full path
  of the executables that would have been executed when this argument had been entered at the shell prompt.
  It does this by searching for an executable or script in the directories listed in the environment
  variable PATH using the same algorithm as bash.

  The GnuWin32 port of Which searches for a matching file in the following sequence of directories:

    - The current directory.
    - The directories that are listed in the PATH environment variable.

  If the filename given on the command line cannot be found in any of the above directories,
  the search is repeated with the extensions given in the environment variable PATHEXT until a match occurs.
  If PATHEXT is empty or does not exist, a value of ".com;.exe;.bat;.cmd" is assumed.
