ReleaseNotes: |-
  - 7.32.05
  Fixed bug in gam <UserTypeEntity> print messages|threads ... headers <SMTPHeaderList> where
  headers other than those specified in <SMTPHeaderList> were displayed.
  Updated gam info users <UserTypeEntity> to display the following data when the Licensing API
  does not return data due to quota limits. Previously, no License data was displayed and
  there was no way to know if it was omitted due to API quota limits vs the user has no license?
    Licenses: (1)
      Not available/incomplete
  If a user has no licenses, this will be displayed.
    Licenses: (0)
  You should use license_skus = <SKUIDList> in gam.cfg to list all of the licensing SKUs
  used in your workspace. Without this list, GAM has to make 70+ API calls to get the licenses
  for a user; this can cause quota limit errors.
