ReleaseNotes: |-
  - 7.31.00
  Fixed bug in gam report chrome (user <UserItem>)|(select <UserTypeEntity>) where no activities were returned.
  report chrome does not use the parameter userKey=<EmailAddress> as do other applications but requires
  parameter filter DEVICE_USER==<EmailAddress>.
  Updated gam report admin (user <UserItem>)|(select <UserTypeEntity>) to use parameter filter USER_EMAIL==<EmailAddress>
  to display activiities affecting the user <EmailAddress>. Use option userisactor to use the parameter userKey=<EmailAddress>
  that displays activities where user <EmailAddress> executed the command that generated the activity.
  Fixed bug in gam print cros|filelist|users ... (addcsvdata <FieldName> <String>)+ formatjson where the addcsvdata columns
  were not displayed but the additional field values were included in the JSON data. Now, the addcsvdata columns
  are displayed but the additional field values are only included in the JSON data when option includdecsvdatainjson is specified.
  Added option addcsvdata <FieldName> <String> to gam <UserTypeEntity> print cigroups|groups
  that adds additional columns of data to the CSV file output.
  Added option addcsvdata <FieldName> <String> to gam <UserTypeEntity> print cigroupmembere|group-members
  that adds additional columns of data to the CSV file output.
