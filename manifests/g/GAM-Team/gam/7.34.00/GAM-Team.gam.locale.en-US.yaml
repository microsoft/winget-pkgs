ReleaseNotes: |-
  - 7.34.00
  Added variable csv_output_header_required to gam.cfg that is a comma separated list of <Strings>
  that are required to be in the list of column headers in the CSV file written by a gam print command.
  This will typically be used to specify headers that are required in subsequent commands that process
  the CSV file even if the API didn't return any data for those columns.
  Updated the following commands to not require the Directory API - Domains scope
  unless the internal or external options are used to request the member category.
  gam info|print groups
  gam print|show group-members
  gam info|print cigroups
  gam print|show cigroup-members
  gam <UserTypeEntity> print|show filesharecounts
