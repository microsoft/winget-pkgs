ReleaseNotes: |-
  - 7.09.00
  Removed the overly broad service account IAM and Access Management API scope https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform
  from DWD. The gam <UserTypeEntity> check|Update serviceaccount commands issue an error message if this scope
  is enabled prompting you to update your service account authorization so that the scope can be removed.
  GAM commands that need IAM access now use the more limited scope https://www.googleapis.com/auth/iam in a non-DWD manner.
  Added enforce_expansive_access Boolean variable to gam.cfg that provides the default value
  for option enforceexpansiveaccess in all commands that delete or update drive file ACLs/permissions.
  It's default value is False.
  gam <UserTypeEntity> delete permissions
  gam <UserTypeEntity> delete drivefileacl
  gam <UserTypeEntity> update drivefileacl
  gam <UserTypeEntity> copy drivefile
  gam <UserTypeEntity> move drivefile
  gam <UserTypeEntity> transfer ownership
  gam <UserTypeEntity> claim ownership
  gam <UserTypeEntity> transfer drive
  Fixed bug in gam print shareddriveorganizers that caused a trap when an organizer was a deleted user.
  Updated to Python 3.13.4
