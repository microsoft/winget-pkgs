ReleaseNotes: |-
  - 7.30.00
  Added input_dir directory variable to gam.cfg that is used to select a directory for reading files with non-absolute file names.
  The default is an empty string that matches the current behavior where these files are read from the current working directory.
  This will be most useful in multiple domain situations where each domain will have distinct drive_dir and input_dir values.
  Added support for the new resource calendar setting autoAcceptInvitations.
