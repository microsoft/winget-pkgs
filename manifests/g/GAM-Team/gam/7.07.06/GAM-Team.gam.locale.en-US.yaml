ReleaseNotes: |-
  - 7.07.06
  Added option eventrowfilter to gam calendars <CalendarEntity> print events ... countsonly
  and gam <UserTypeEntity> print events <UserCalendarEntity> ... countsonly that causes
  GAM to apply config csv_output_row_filter to the event details rather than the event counts.
  This will be useful when <EventSelectProperty> and <EventMatchProperty> do not have the
  capabilty to select the events of interest; e.g., you want to filter based on the event created property.
  Dropped the extraneous id column for gam calendars <CalendarEntity> print events ... countsonly
  and gam <UserTypeEntity> print events <UserCalendarEntity> ... countsonly.
