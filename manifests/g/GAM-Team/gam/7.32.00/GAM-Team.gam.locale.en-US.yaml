ReleaseNotes: |-
  7.32.00
  Added option verifyallowexternal to gam print cigroup-members|group-members that causes
  GAM to only display external members in groups with `allowExternalMembers=False'.
  This option can be used to help verify that internal-only groups don't have external members.
  Updated option internaldomains for the following commands:
  gam info|print groups
  gam print|show group-members
  gam info|print cigroups
  gam print|show cigroup-members
  gam <UserTypeEntity> print|show filesharecounts
  Which domains are considered internal domains:
  - internaldomains all - All of your workspace domains; this is the default
  - internaldomains primary - Your workspace primary domain
  - internaldomains <DomainNameList> - A list of domain names
  Added option csv to gam <CrOSTypeEntity> issuecommand command <CrOSCommand>
  and gam <CrOSTypeEntity> getcommand commandid <CommandID> so that command details are displayed in CSV format.
  This can be used to log commands issued to devices and then monitor the results.
  Added option filemimetype category <MimeTypeNameList> to gam <UserTypeEntity> copy drivefile to support
  copying of files based on their MimeType category.
  Added option attendeeslist to gam calendars <CalendarEntity> print events and gam <UserTypeEntity> print events
  that causes GAM to display the attendee email addresses in a single column attendeesList; no attendee details
  are displayed. The email addresses are separated by csv_output_field_delimiter from gam.cfg.
  Fixed bug in gam sendemail ... replyto <EmailAddress> that caused a message delivery error if
  <EmailAddress> did not include a domain name.
  Added support for users's chat sections.
  - See: https://github.com/GAM-team/GAM/wiki/Users-Chat#manage-chat-users-sections
  - This is in Deveoper Preview; you must have a developer_preview_api_key in gam.cfg to use these commands.
  - See Update History
