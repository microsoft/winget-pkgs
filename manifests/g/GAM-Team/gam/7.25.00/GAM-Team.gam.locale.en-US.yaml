  - 7.25.00
  Removed a capabilty added in 7.24.00 that allowed reading command data from Google Docs and Sheets
  when a user's service account access to Drive and Sheets had been disabled. Jay was concerned
  that this change could be exploited to give access to all user's files.
  This capability has been replaced by issuing the following commands. The admin specified in gam oauth create
  can read command data from Docs and Sheets to which it has access.
  gam config commanddata_clientaccess true save
  gam oauth create
  Enable the following and proceed to authorization.
  [*] 42)  Drive API - commanddata_clientaccess
  [*] 54)  Sheets API - commanddata_clientaccess
  Fixed in bug in gam report that caused a trap with either of the thismonth or previousmonths options were used.
  Upgraded to Python 3.14.0.
