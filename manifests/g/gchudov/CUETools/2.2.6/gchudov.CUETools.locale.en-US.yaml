ShortDescription: CD image processing suite with optimized lossless encoders in C#
Description: >
  CUETools is a tool for lossless audio/CUE sheet format conversion. The goal is
  to make sure the album image is preserved accurately. A lossless disc image
  must be lossless not only in preserving contents of the audio tracks, but also
  in preserving gaps and CUE sheet contents. Many applications lose vital
  information upon conversion, and don't support all possible CUE sheet styles.
  For example, foobar2000 loses disc pre-gap information when converting an
  album image, and doesn't support gaps appended (noncompliant) CUE sheets.
