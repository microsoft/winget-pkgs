ReleaseNotes: |-
  Preferences
  - Added File Operations / Renaming Files / Allow rename into other directories option. Allows you to disable the feature in inline rename where files can be moved to other folders.
  - FAYT Quick Keys can now be up to 4 characters long instead of just a single key. For example, you could assign >> for command mode and >? for DOS command mode. Typing a leading key of a multi-character key puts the FAYT in the new "mode" mode, which shows a popup list of all modes that match the prefix typed so far. You can disable this popup if you want with the new option on the Filtering and Sorting / Find-As-You-Type page.

  Commands
  - Added Set FAYTFINDOPTIONS command, lets you toggle various FAYT Find Mode options from a command.
  - Buttons that use @keydown can now provide additional tooltip text for the various key combinations. For example, @keydown:shift:Opens a new window.
  - As well as Standard, Script, MS-DOS, etc, a new "Evaluator Function" function type is now available for buttons, hotkeys, etc. This lets you write a function in "pure" evaluator code. The @functype: modifier and Command.SetType() script methods now accept "eval" to indicate an evaluator function.

  Scripting
  - The New Script dialog can now generate a new script from custom templates. This lets you add support for additional languages like Python. Templates should be stored in the /dopusdata/Script AddIns/Templates folder.
  - In script dialogs, you can now add items to listview controls with the AddItem/InsertItemAt methods using a vector (or JScript array) to initialise an item and its subitems at once. You can also pass a two-dimensional array to add multiple items.
  - Added Word wrap option (enabled by default) for script dialog multiline edit controls.
  - Changes to the script FSUtil.Run() method:
    - You can now wait for the launched process without having to redirect its output. If the third argument is a string instead of a bool value, it specifies a flags value. Current flags are "r" for redirect output, and "w" for wait. ("r" implies "w" but "w" can be used to wait without redirecting).
    - The string provided by the optional fourth argument will now be fed to the process stdin even if not waiting for it to finish.
    - A new optional fifth argument which lets you specify the current directory for the launched process.
  - The Dialog.FlushMsg() method now takes two optional parameters, both wildcard strings to match against the event name and control name. Only messages matching the wildcards will be flushed.
  - Added Dialog.Controls() method for script dialogs. Returns an enumerable collection of all Control objects in the dialog.

  Evaluator
  - The evaluator now supports arrays. The following functions have been added to create and work with arrays: ArrayCreate, ArrayGet, ArraySet, ArrayPush, ArrayPop, ArrayErase, ArrayCopy, ArraySort, ArrayRev. Additionally the Len() function can be used to query the number of elements in an array.
  - Added Run() function to allow evaluator functions to run internal and external commands.
  - Added Dialog() function to allow evaluator functions to display simple dialogs.
  - Added GetItems() function. Returns an array of item paths from the specified tab.
  - Added Explode() and Implode() functions.
  - Added ES() function which provides a way to use C-style escaping in a string for characters like tab and CR/LF.
  - IsSelected() and FileCount() now work in function contexts even if the function itself doesn't use any files (or more accurately, if Opus thinks it doesn't use any files).
  - The Match() function can now match against an array as well as a string.

  Other changes
  - In the Folder Format dialog, the View tab now has a separate font setting for thumbnails mode.
  - Context-sensitive button enable/disable now works with commands that use @ifsel: to change their behaviour depending on selected file status.
  - Improved performance of some HEIC/HEIF thumbnails.
  - If a multi-key hotkey and a multi-key quick key share a prefix, the hotkey normally gets priority. However if a subsequent key matches the quick key but not the hot key, the string typed up to that point is now fed through to the FAYT.
  - The F10 information display in the standalone image viewer now includes a histogram of the image.
