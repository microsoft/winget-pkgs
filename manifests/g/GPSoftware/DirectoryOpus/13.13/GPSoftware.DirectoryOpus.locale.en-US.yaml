ReleaseNotes: |-
  Folder Tab Drag & Drop
  - You can now drag folder tabs out of the tab bar to create new windows for them (like in a web browser), without having to drag them to the Windows desktop.
  - When dragging a folder tab out to open it as a new window, the drag thumbnail now scales with DPI.
  - Fix for titlebar flashing when dragging folder tabs in a dual-display window when Move top-row toolbars into the window title bar" is on.

  Commands
  - Added Go command SETFOCUS argument. When combined with a keyword like OPENINDUAL this causes the target file display to become active. You can also use it with Go DRIVEBUTTONS=multifunc.
  - Added Toolbar command RELOAD argument; allows you to reload a currently open toolbar from disk (in case the disk file has changed).
  - Previously the Toolbar command's NAME field supported *this to mean the current toolbar only in conjunction with the CLOSE argument. This now works with other arguments (e.g. TOGGLE, RELOAD, etc) too.

  Scripting
  - DialogListItem.subitems now returns a real object (DialogListSubItems) which is a collection of real objects (DialogListSubItem) rather than strings. Existing code should continue to work without needing modification.
  - The new DialogListSubItem script object has fg, bg and styles properties which allow colors and font styles to be specified for individual columns.
  - Added Filter.Load script method to load a saved filter.
  - Added TabStats properties expandeddirs, expandedcontents, selexpanded, checkedexpanded properties.
  - Single line and numeric edit fields in script dialogs have a new Enter property. When set to true, pressing the enter key in the field will no longer trigger the dialog's default button (if it has one) - instead, you'll receive an "enter" message in your script message loop.
  - Script commands can now return 1 from their command method to indicate they want to be called once for each selected file.

  Evaluator
  - The evaluator Rnd function will now return a different value each time it's called on a particular thread (previously it was only guaranteed to return a different value within the one piece of evaluation code). This means e.g. a rename function that uses {=Rnd()=} will get a different value for each file.
  - The evaluator Asc and Chr functions now support unicode surrogate pairs.

  Miscellaneous
  - Improvement to Synchronize folder exclusion lists. Excluded folders are now skipped even if they're inside other folders that don't exist in the destination.
  - Improved logic for naming new junctions/softlinks/etc. when there's already something with the same name.
  - Improved logic for Replace > Rename New, making it more strict when looking for and bumping "(1)" style counts on the end.
  - Aliases are now supported for Preferences / Miscellaneous / Advanced: [Behavior] everything_autolaunch.
  - If reading a network folder fails and the error isn't one that Opus recognises as meaning authentication is required, the error message now includes a Connect link that you can click to force Opus to request credentials. If the connection is successful the error code is added to the network_errors Advanced Preferences setting so that future failures will request authentication immediately.
