ReleaseNotes: |-
  Changelog
  - (Breaking) There has been some changes in the server protocol.
    Make sure to kill the old server process when you update to avoid errors (i.e. lf -remote 'quit!').
  - (Breaking) A new server command query is added to expose internal state to users (#1384) (by @joelim-work).
    A new builtin command cmds is added to display the commands. The old builtin command jumps is now removed.
    The builtin commands maps and cmaps now use the new server command.
  - (Breaking) Environment variable exporting for files and options are not performed anymore while previewing and cleaning to avoid various issues with race conditions (#1354) (by @joelim-work).
    Cleaning program should now instead receive an additional sixth argument for the next file path to be previewed to allow comparisons with the previous file path.
    User options (i.e. user_{option}) are now exported whenever they are changed (#1418) (by @raslop).
  - (Breaking) Command outputs are now exclusively attached to stderr to allow printing the last directory or selection to stdout (#1399 and #1402) (by @joelim-work).
    Two new command line options -print-last-dir and -print-selection are added to print the last directory and selection to stdout.
    The example script etc/lfcd.sh is updated to use -print-last-dir instead.
    Other lfcd scripts are also likely to be updated in the future to use the new method (patches are welcome).
  - (Breaking) The option ruler is now deprecated in favor of its replacement rulerfmt (#1386) (by @joelim-work).
    The new rulerfmt option is more capable (i.e. displays option values, supports colors and attributes, and supports optional fields) and more consistent with the rest of our options.
    See the documentation for more information.
  - (New) Modifier keys (i.e. control, shift, alt) with special keys (e.g. arrows, enter) are now supported for most combinations (#1248) (by @joelim-work).
  - (New) A new option borderfmt is added to configure colors for pane borders (#1251) (by @joelim-work).
  - (New) New lf specific environment variables, LF_CONFIG_HOME on Windows and LF_CONFIG/DATA_HOME on Unix, are now supported to set the configuration directory (#1253) (by @alok-mishra).
  - (New) Tilde (i.e. ~) expansion is performed during completion to be able to use expanded tilde paths as command arguments (#1246) (by @joelim-work).
  - (New) A new option preserve is added to preserve attributes (i.e. mode and timestamps) while copying (#1026) (by @raslop).
  - (New) The file etc/icons.example is updated for nerd-fonts v3.0.0 (#1271) (by @MunifTanjim).
  - (New) A new builtin command clearmaps is added to clear all default keybindings except for read (i.e. :) and cmap keybindings to be able to :quit (#1286) (by @joelim-work).
  - (New) A new option statfmt is added to configure the status line at the bottom (#1288) (by @joelim-work).
  - (New) A new option truncatepct is added to determine the location of truncation from the beginning in terms of percentage (#1029) (by @raslop).
  - (New) A new option dupfilefmt is added to configure the names of duplicate files while copying (#1315) (by @Limero).
  - (New) Shell scripts etc/lf.nu and etc/lfcd.nu are added to the repository to allow completion and directory change with Nushell (#1341) (by @mauerlaeufer).
  - (New) Sixels are now supported for previewing (#1211) (by @horriblename).
    A new option sixel is added to enable this behavior.
  - (New) A new configuration keyword setlocal is added to configure directory specific options (#1381) (by @gokcehan).
  - (New) A new command line command cmd-delete-word-back (default a-backspace and a-backspace2) is added to use word boundaries when deleting a word backwards (#1409) (by @janpeterd).
  - (Fix) Cursor positions in the directory should now be preserved after file operations that changes the directory (e.g. create or delete) (#1247) (by @joelim-work).
  - (Fix) Option reverse should now respect to sort stability requirements (#1261) (by @joelim-work).
  - (Fix) Backspace should not exit filter mode anymore (#1269) (by @jdujava).
