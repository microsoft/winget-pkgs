ReleaseNotes: |-
  Version 1.9 – Simple Annual Accounting (formerly Annual Accounting)
  1. Name Change of the Application:
  To ensure better consistency with the naming of my other applications published on the Microsoft Store, the name "Annual Accounting" is now changed to "Simple Annual Accounting". This change does not affect existing features but reflects a desire for uniformity and clarity in the presentation of my Windows desktop applications.
  2. New Features:
  - Added functionality allowing the use of keyboard arrows (left, right, up, down) to move the cursor in different cells of the graphical interface table.
  Added redirection links in the menu bar:
  - A direct link to the README.md file of the GitHub repository.
  - Quick access to the application usage license.
  These links are now accessible in the menu bar tabs of the graphical interface.
  French version available in the Microsoft store here: https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9NRT5NWBMZR6?hl=fr-be&gl=BE&ocid=pdpshare
