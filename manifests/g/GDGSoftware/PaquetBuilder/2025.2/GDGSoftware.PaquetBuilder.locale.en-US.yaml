ReleaseNotes: |-
  Version 2025.2 – February 12th, 2025

  - Changed project saving behavior: projects created with older versions are now consistently
    saved in UTF-8 format.
  - Resolved Unicode encoding issues with emoticons to ensure correct display in dialog boxes.
  - Fixed the Sleep custom action that was not working as expected with the new C compiler.
  - Updated error reporting for SignTool: instead of displaying an error message when SignTool is
    not found, a notification is now shown in the status bar.
  - Enhanced WebUpdate filtering: items intended exclusively for 64-bit (and 32-bit) systems are
    now properly filtered.
  - Fixed the CRC calculation in the WebUpdate module: it now computes the CRC based on the file
    content rather than the string representation.
  - Introduced a silent installation option for Paquet Builder to enable streamlined deployments.
  - Minor bug fixes and optimizations.
