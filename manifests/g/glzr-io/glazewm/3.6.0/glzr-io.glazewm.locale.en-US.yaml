  Join the Discord server‚ö°ü¶Ä New method of switching between workspaces  (#792)
  We've implemented "cloaking" as the new default method for hiding/showing windows during workspace switches. This brings a few big improvements:
  - Instant transitions when switching between workspaces.
  - Better stability and compatibility with third-party apps (resolving issues like #250).
  - Consistency in which windows are shown in the taskbar.
  Note: With cloaking enabled, windows from all workspaces appear in the Windows taskbar. The new method should hopefully feel much nicer, but the legacy method remains available via general.hide_method set to hide.üéâ Other new features
  - New --hide-window flag for shell-exec to run commands in background (#819).
      - Makes it possible to run scripts without any terminal popup windows.
  - Add new position --x-pos <POS> --y-pos <POS> command for repositioning floating windows (#817).
      - e.g. position --x-pos 0 --y-pos 0.
  - Size and position can now be set with the set-floating command (#817)
      - e.g. set-floating --x-pos 0 --y-pos 0 --width 500px --height 500px.
  - Smoother restore from maximize into tiling/floating position (#852).
  üêõ Bug fixes
  - Fix regression from v3.4.0 where some taskbar positions cause incorrect working area (#850, fixes #790).
  - Persist window animations setting across restarts (#832, fixes #651).
  - Prevent window flicker when toggling between fullscreen states (#851, fixes #640).
  - Set focus to valid desktop window in an empty workspace (#821).
  üõ†Ô∏èÔ∏è Internal changes
  - Change cargo lib and bin path to enable build on WSL (#827).
  - Linting fixes and working doctests (#834, #831).
