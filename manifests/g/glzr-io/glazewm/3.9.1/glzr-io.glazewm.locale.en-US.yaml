ReleaseNotes: |-
  üêõ Bug fixes
  - Fixed error with keep_alive workspaces that were bound to a specific monitor (#1102).
  - Reverted rule for initializing WS_POPUP windows as floating (#1101). This was causing common apps like Steam, Telegram, and more to initialize as floating instead of tiling correctly.
  üõ†Ô∏èÔ∏è Internal changes
  - Updated winget-releaser in Winget release workflow (#1098).
  Big thanks to @vikingnope for contributing to this release üíõ
