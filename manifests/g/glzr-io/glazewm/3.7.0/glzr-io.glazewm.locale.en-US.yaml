ReleaseNotes: |-
  üéâ New features
  - Add new wm-toggle-pause command for fully pausing the WM (#828, #870).
      - Replaced the alt+shift+p keybinding in the default config with this new command.
  - Configure whether to show all windows in the native Windows taskbar (#873, resolves #848).
      - The previous release changed windows to be hidden/shown via a new method called cloaking. Cloaking causes all windows to be shown in the taskbar, which is now configurable with general.show_all_in_taskbar.
  - Improve --centered flag behavior for set-floating and toggle-floating (#842).
  - Revert alt+s and alt+a in the default config to switch focus between prev/next active workspace (#865).
  üêõ Bug fixes
  - Restore to previous tiling size from minimized/fullscreen (#876, fixes #506 #782).
  - move-workspace moves cursor if cursor_jump is enabled (#874, fixes #859).
  - Fix focus_follows_cursor on touchpads (#875, fixes #799).
  - Prevent moving tiling windows with mouse from affecting hidden workspaces (#877, fixes #829).
  - Fix path delimiters to CLI directory in PATH env variable (#872).
