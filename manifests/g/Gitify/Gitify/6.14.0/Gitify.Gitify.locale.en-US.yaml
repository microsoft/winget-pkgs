ShortDescription: GitHub notifications on your menu bar.
Description: Ever got lost with GitHub notifications? Too many emails? Gitify is all about making your life easier. Sitting on your menu bar, it informs you for any GitHub notifications without being annoying and of course without adverts. It just gets the job done. Works with GitHub and GitHub Enterprise. You can even connect multiple accounts.
