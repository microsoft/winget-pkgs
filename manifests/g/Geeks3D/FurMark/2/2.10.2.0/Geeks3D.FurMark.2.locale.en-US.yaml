ShortDescription: GPU Stress Test, OpenGL and Vulkan Graphics Benchmark
Description: |-
  FurMark 2 (successor of the venerable FurMark 1), is a lightweight and very intensive graphics card / GPU stress test. It's also a handy OpenGL and Vulkan graphics benchmark.

  Key Features:
  - Extreme Load Testing: Maximizes GPU utilization to detect instability, overheating, or throttling.
  - Real-Time Monitoring: Temps, fan speed, clocks, FPS, and power draw (via supported hardware).
  - Burn-in Mode: Sustained stress tests for system validation or cooling checks.
  - Benchmarking: Scores performance across preset resolutions/AA settings.
  - Customization: Adjust resolution, anti-aliasing, and duration.
