ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Ported to VC++ 2022 compiler. Please take a note that due to this change MSI
    Afterburner will no longer be able to start under Windows XP. Please stay on
    the previous versions of the product if you need this OS support
  - Please take a note that size of mandatory VC++ 2022 runtime redistributables
    roughly doubled comparing to the previously used VC++ 2008 redistributables,
    and we’d like to avoid providing overblown application distributive,
    drastically increased in size due to bundling newer and much heavier VC++
    redistributables with it. To deal with this issue we provide our own original
    tiny web installer for VC++ redistributables, which allowed decreasing the
    size of final application distributive drastically even comparing to the
    previous VC++ 2008 based version. Please take a note that install time can be
    increased slightly due to downloading VC++ 2022 runtimes redistributables on
    the fly during installation. If you install MSI Afterburner offline, you can
    always deploy required VC++ 2022 distributives later with web installer by
    launching .\Redist\VCRedistDeploy.bat
  - Now the installer and uninstaller are performing active application instance
    checking on earlier stages before displaying any GUI
  - Added NVIDIA GeForce RTX 50x0 series graphics cards support
  - Added quad fan control support for reference design NVIDIA GeForce RTX 50x0
    series graphics cards
  - Added software interface for future G-Assist integration
  - MSI Windows 11 Dark skin is selected as default application skin now. Please
    take a note that quad fan control GUI is currently available in Dark and Light
    editions of MSI Windows 11 skins only. If you prefer to use some older legacy
    skins on NVIDIA GeForce RTX 50x0 with 3 or 4 independently controllable fans,
    you may still switch between all fans in async fan control mode by
    pressing <Shift>+<F> repeatedly
  - Added new MSI Special and MSI H2O skins by Drerex design. New skins natively
    supports quad fan control feature on reference design NVIDIA GeForce RTX 50x0
    series graphics cards
  - Extended +3000MHz memory clock overclocking range tweak for NVIDIA RTX 5000
    series graphics cards
  - Added AMD RDNA4 GPU family and AMD RADEON RX 9000 series cards support. Please
    take a note that MSI do not sell any AMD RDNA4 based graphics cards, so RDNA4
    support is completely unofficial
  - Added MP2988 and MP29816A voltage controllers support. New PWM controllers
    support is reserved for future extreme overclocking oriented graphics card
    models with triple/quad channel voltage control. Please take a note that such
    voltage controllers are also used on the most of currently existing NVIDIA RTX
    5080 and RTX 5090 series cards, but unfortunately I2C address range of PWM
    controllers on reference cards is blacklisted by NVIDIA display driver, making
    extended voltage control on currently existing NVIDIA RTX 50x0 series cards
    impossible
  - Added voltage control support for AMD RADEON RX 7800XT series graphics cards
  - Added voltage control support for new low-cost revisions of NVIDIA GeForce RTX
    40x0 GPUs
  - Added new GPU hiding functionality. Added "Hide GPU" button to GPU selection
    panel of default Dark and Light editions of MSI Windows 11 skins. Alternately,
    you may use <Ctrl> + <H> keyboard shortcut to hide currently selected GPU if
    you prefer to use legacy or third party GUI skins with no such button. You may
    use it to completely remove some GPUs from MSI Afterburner's GUI, including
    both hardware control and hardware monitoring sections. The functionality is
    intended for hiding integrated iGPUs
  - Relaxing preemptive sleep delay is now excluded from cumulative polling time
    displayed by performance profiler on Overdrive8 capable graphics cards to
    avoid confusing beginners
  - Name of voltage rail mapped to AUX or AUX2 voltage slider (e.g. VDDCI, MSVDD,
    PEXVDD or 1V8) is now displayed in context help of AUX or AUX2 GUI controls
    and inside MSI Afterburner system info window ("i" button)
  - Added internal database format improvements, allowing us to remap AUX/AUX2 GUI
    controls to different physical voltage rail if multiple optional controllable
    voltage rails are available
  - Empty compact names of some iGPUs in GPU selection panel are now replaced with
    abstract "AMD GPU" / "NVIDIA GPU" / “Intel GPU" names
  - Fixed GUID, PCI location and registry key info displayed in MSI Afterburner
    system info window ("i" button) for secondary Intel GPUs
  - I2C cache of secondary GPUs is now saved inside proper hardware profile file.
    Previously it was always written to and read from the primary GPU's profile
  - Asynchronous fan control buttons are no longer displayed in GUI on GPUs with
    no fan control support (e.g. iGPUs)
  - Now MSI Afterburner reinitializes skin scaling engine on DPI scaling change
    events to prevent cases when GUI looks cut off in some cases (e.g. after
    switching between display resolutions with different DPI scaling settings)
  - Now MSI Afterburner is forcibly uninstalling IO driver on OS shutdown to
    prevent the driver from being hibernated and reloaded due to fast startup till
    the next clean system boot event
  - Fixed instances enumeration for some performance counters with no localized
    names (e.g. GPU related Windows performance counters) in PerfCounter.dll
    plugin
  - Added experimental support for "Beta: Use Unicode UTF-8 for global language
      support" option enabled in administrative regional OS settings. Now each
      localization description file contains additional "Codepage" field, defining
      runtime ANSI to UTF8 conversion rule for selected language pack
  - Refactored CPU info database format provides more simplified and unified
    future database updates for MSI Afterburner monitoring HAL, CPU.dll sample
    plugin and RivaTuner Statistics Server’s own monitoring HAL
  - Added experimental support for AMD Ryzen 9xxx CPUs
  - Added experimental support for Intel Arrow Lake CPUs
  - Added alternate Voltage/Frequency point locking mode inside Voltage/Frequency
    curve editor. Now you may repeatedly press <L> key inside V/F curve editor to
    switch between voltage locking and max frequency locking mode
  - Optimized GPU context switching implementation in HAL. This provides slightly
    faster GPU selection in GUI and slightly reduced CPU polling time for the
    systems with multiple GPUs
  - Now MSI Afterburner uses extended 32KB RivaTuner Statistics Server’s text slot
    instead of previously used 4KB slot to display On-Screen Display. Due to this
    improvement legacy MSI Afterburner On-Screen Display can fit up to 8x more
    text items without hitting the limit
  - Updated HwInfo.dll plugin. Now the plugin can automatically spawn new versions
    on HwInfo, which now store path to installed application in slightly different
    installer’s registry key
  - Added Bulgarian localization
  - Seriously revamped German and Ukrainian localizations
  - Fixed ACL bypass vulnerability and NULL ptr dereferencein RTCore driver
    (reported by Andres Roldan)
  - RivaTuner Statistics Server has been upgraded to v7.3.7:
  - New version’s changes list is huge, it includes more than 150 compatibility
    enhancements, changes and new features including programmable conditional
    layers support, PresentMon, LibreHardwareMonitor and NVIDIA Reflex integration
