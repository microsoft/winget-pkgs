ShortDescription: Gpg4win - a secure solution for file and email encryption.
Description: Gpg4win enables users to securely transport emails and files with the help of encryption and digital signatures. Encryption protects the contents against an unwanted party reading it. Digital signatures make sure that it was not modified and comes from a specific sender.

  Noteworthy changes in Version 4.3.0 (2024-01-25)
  ------------------------------------------------

  --- Highlights ---

  - Kleopatra: A new mail viewer mode has been added, allowing crypto
    mails received by mail clients without PGP/MIME or S/MIME support
    to be decrypted. This means that you can open an SMIME.p7m file
    or openpgp-encrypted-message.asc attachment with Kleopatra, and
    it will be displayed as a mail. [T6199]

  - Kleopatra: It is now possible to certify multiple certificates at
    once using the group interface. [T6469]

  --- Features ---

  - Okular (GnuPG Edition): This PDF reader has received a lot of
    updates and is now ready for everyday's use.

  - GnuPG: Support for proxy authentication using the Negotiation method
    has been added. [T6719]

  - GnuPG: Keyserver can now be configured to the value "none" to avoid
    unnecessary queries to non-existing keyservers that would slow down the
    system. [T6708]

  - GnuPG: Es kann nun der Wert "none" als SchlÃ¼sselserver verwendet
    werden, um unnÃ¶tige Abfragen gegen nicht existierende Server zu
    vermeiden, die das System verlangsamen wÃ¼rden. [T6708]

  - GnuPG: A new option has been added to ignore specific CRL
    extensions. This can help as a workaround for problems with specific
    CRLs. [T6545]

  - GnuPG: Automatic proxy detection has been improved. [T5768]

  - Kleopatra: The start time of Kleopatra has been drastically
    improved on throttled systems with third-party software installed, which
    manipulates system calls. The number of system calls to start Kleopatra
    has been roughly halved. [T6259]

  - Kleopatra: The advanced options in the certification view are now
    automatically visible if they were open in the last certification. [T6480]

  - Kleopatra: Windows dark mode is now fully supported. [T4066]

  - Kleopatra: Some invalid operations, such as signing with an expired
    certificate, which would have resulted in errors, can no longer be
    triggered. The reason for this is indicated, too. [T6742 T6788]

  - Kleopatra: The support for Telesec signature cards has been
    improved. [T6830]

  - Kleopatra: When exporting or publishing certificates, the user is
    now informed if there are uncertified certificates in the export. This
    is especially useful when exporting groups. [T6766]

  - Kleopatra: Expiry dates after 19.01.2038 (year 2038 bug) are now
    possible. [T6736]

  - Kleopatra: The dialog to extend OpenPGP certificates has been
    improved and redundant options removed. [T6621]

  - Kleopatra: When creating archives, they are now written out as a
    .part file to improve error handling and canceling the operation without
    leaving a broken archive in the file system. [T6584]

  - Kleopatra: Updating certificates now also looks for updates in a
    Web Key Directory if one exists for the domain. [T5951]

  - Kleopatra: Progress bars are now also properly shown for S/MIME
    file operations. [T6534]

  - GpgOL: Added support for RFC2231 encoded attachment filenames,
    which increases compatibility with Apple Mail. [T6604]

  - GpgOL: Draft encryption with S/MIME certificates now skips CRL
    checks and is much faster and reliable. [T6827]

  - GpgOL: The error handling was improved if a preference for S/MIME
    is set and signing selected but no signing certificate can be found.
    See: https://gnupg.com/vsd/registry-settings.html (smimeNoCertSigErr)
    on how to add a custom message to instruct users what to do in this
    case. [T6683]

  - GpgOL: It is now possible to encrypt to S/MIME certificates that
    are untrusted or cannot be validated because of CRL errors. In
    this case a warning dialog is shown, allowing the user to override the
    errors. This is not VS-NfD compliant but can be used for unrestricted
    encryption. [T6701]

  - GpgOL: Mails without the correct MIME type but which still look
    like crypto mails are now decrypted. This improves compatibility with
    Apple Mail and various mail gateways that modify the structure of crypto
    mails in transit. [T6701]

  - GpgOL: The internal attachments are now called
    "GpgOL_MIME_structure.mime" instead of "GpgOL_MIME_structure.txt"
    to make it easier to link them to Kleopatra. This is, for example,
    visible for users when using the Outlook web interface. [T6656]

  - GpgOL: The initialization has been moved to avoid the incorrect message
    that GpgOL is causing a slow start of Outlook. This message might still
    be shown, since Outlook shows this sometimes regardless of actual timings,
    but the delay should be 0ms. [T6856]

  - GpgOL: The security approval dialog has been improved to better show
    problems with the available certificates in case a compliant encryption
    is not possible. [T6742 T6743 T6744]

  - GpgOL: The security approval dialog now increases its size based on
    the number of recipients to avoid having to use a scroll bar. [T6837]

  --- Bug Fixes ---

  - Kleopatra: The state of Kleopatra is now properly stored in
    configuration files when Kleopatra is shut down on user log out.
    [T6667]

  - Kleopatra: Importing a certificate with Kleopatra will now open the
    main window of Kleopatra. [T6671]

  - Kleopatra: No longer unnecessarily watches the clipboard for changes;
    this could have caused issues with password managers that would empty the
    clipboard as soon as a third-party application tried to access it. [T6531]

  - Kleopatra: It is no longer possible to set expiry dates in the
    past. [T6519]

  - Kleopatra: Importing multiple certificates at once can no longer
    cause Kleopatra to lock up. [T6323]

  - Kleopatra: When generating keys on a smart card in compliance mode,
    only compliant algorithms are offered. [T6750]

  - Kleopatra: Fixed an issue where certificate tags would not be
    displayed correctly after reloading certificates. [T6768]

  - GpgOL: The security approval dialog now correctly updates the
    compliance status after switching protocols. [T6600]

  - GpgOL: The security approval is now always shown and displays the
    correct state for groups containing untrusted or otherwise non-compliant
    certificates. [T6401]

  - GpgOL: Fixed an issue with S/MIME opaque signed mails where the
    contents of invalid signed mails would not be shown. [T6624]

  - GpgOL: When generating a key through the security approval dialog,
    the configured default algorithms from GnuPG are now used. [T6805]

  - GpgOL: Generating keys through the security approval dialog now
    works as intended. [T6813 T6823 T6566]

  - GpgOL: A crash issue has been resolved that could occur when
    switching between different Outlook views, for example, from the
    calendar back to the mail view, while a crypto mail was
    open. This crash was only happening in Outlook versions older
    than Outlook 2019 or when the "always preview messages" setting
    was enabled. This potential crash affected all modern versions of
    GpgOL. (T6861)
