ReleaseNotes: |
  --- Features --- -  GnuPG: In de-vs mode use AES-128 instead of 3-DES as implicit
     preference.  This avoids problems with software considering 3-DES
     as non-compliant but does only announce 3-DES as supported
     algorithm.  [T6063]
  -  GnuPG: Add new LDAP server flag "areconly" (A-record-only) to
     help against long delays on some AD installations.
  -  GnuPG: New feature to mirror an LDAP keyserver to a Web key
     Directory.  [T6224]

     1.6.2 to fix a severe security problem.  [T6230]
