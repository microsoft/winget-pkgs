  Support for GitHub Artifact Attestations
  v2.49.0 release introduces the attestation command set for downloading and verifying attestations about artifacts built in GitHub Actions! This is part of the larger Artifact Attestations initiative. An artifact attestation is a piece of cryptographically signed metadata that is generated as part of your artifact build process. These attestations bind artifacts to the details of the workflow run that produced them, and allow you to guarantee the integrity and provenance of any artifact built in GitHub Actions.
  To get started, check out gh help attestation. You can also use the `gh at <command>` alias for short.
