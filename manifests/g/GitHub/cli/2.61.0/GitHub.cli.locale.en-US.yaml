ReleaseNotes: |-
  Ensure users understand consequences before making repository visibility changes
  In v2.61.0, gh repo edit command has been enhanced to inform users about consequences of changing visibility and ensure users are intentional before making irreversible changes:
  1. Interactive gh repo edit visibility change requires confirmation when changing from public, private, or internal
  2. Non-interactive gh repo edit --visibility change requires new --accept-visibility-change-consequences flag to confirm
  3. New content to inform users of consequences
    - Incorporate GitHub Docs content into help usage and interactive gh repo edit experience
    - Expanded help usage to call out most concerning consequences
    - Display repository star and watcher counts to understand impact before confirming
