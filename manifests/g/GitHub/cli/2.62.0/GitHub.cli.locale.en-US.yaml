  Security
    - A security vulnerability has been identified in GitHub CLI that could allow remote code execution (RCE) when users connect to a malicious Codespace SSH server and use the gh codespace ssh or gh codespace logs commands.
    For more information, see https://github.com/cli/cli/security/advisories/GHSA-p2h2-3vg9-4p87

  GitHub CLI notifies users about latest extension upgrades
    Similar to the notification of latest gh releases, the v2.62.0 version of GitHub CLI will notify users about latest extension upgrades when the extension is used.

    This removes a common pain point of extension authors as they have had to reverse engineer and implement a similar mechanism within their extensions directly.

    With this quality of life improvement, there are 2 big benefits:
    1. Extension authors will hopefully see increased adoption of newer releases while having lower bar to maintaining their extensions.
    2. GitHub CLI users will have greater awareness of new features, bug fixes, and security fixes to the extensions used.

    Extension authors should review their extensions and consider removing any custom logic previously implemented to notify users of new releases.
