  Full Changelog: 1.5.0...1.5.1
  Four Windows build versions are attached to this release:
  1. GoldenDict-1.5.1_(QT_5123)(64bit).7z - Qt5.12.3-based 64-bit version.
  2. GoldenDict-1.5.1_(QT_5123)r.7z - Qt5.12.3-based 32-bit version.
  3. GoldenDict-1.5.1_(QT_486).7z - Qt4.8.6-based 32-bit version.
  4. GoldenDict-1.5.1-Install.exe - an installer of the Qt4.8.6-based 32-bit version (3).
  These same four builds are also available at sourceforge.net in the Qt5 and Qt4 folders (but the Download Latest Version button still points to a very old version 1.0.1).
  An AppImage is not attached, because Travis CI no longer provides gratis builds. See Abs62#3.
  macOS builds are not attached, because no GoldenDict developer works on this OS and there is no CI for it either.
