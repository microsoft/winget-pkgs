Description: |-
  The GLPI Agent is a generic management agent. It can perform a certain number of tasks, according to its own execution plan, or on behalf of a GLPI server acting as a control point.
  This agent is based on a fork of FusionInventory agent and so works mainly like FusionInventory agent. It introduces new features and a new protocol to communicate directly with a GLPI server and its native inventory feature. Anyway it also keeps the compatibility with FusionInventory for GLPI plugin.
