ShortDescription: Open Genesys Cloud automatically at startup and run it in the background.
Description: |-
  The Genesys Cloud desktop app is available for Windows and Mac:
  - Use a dedicated application. Run Genesys Cloud as a stand-alone program, and keep it separate from your browser windows and tabs.
  - Start Genesys Cloud automatically. Automatically open Genesys Cloud when your computer starts up, and avoid missing important communications.
  - Run in silent mode. Close the window but continue to run Genesys Cloud in the background, allowing you to continue receiving chats and notifications.
  - Update automatically. The desktop app notifies you when a newer version is available and prompts you to refresh or install it.
ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Updated to Chromium 137.0.7151.69
  - Updated to .NET 4.8
  - Fixed a crash when switching between desktop and tablet mode.
  - Fixed an issue with authentication involving popup windows.
  - Fixed an alignment issue when switching to full-screen mode in a Genesys Cloud video call.
  - Fixed an issue with the installer not overwriting some files causing a white screen issue on launch.
  Note for administrators using the convenience MSI installer file. The prerequisites for the Genesys Cloud Windows application changed with this update. These prerequisites must be installed before the application is updated. .NET Framework 4.8 and Microsoft Visual C++ redistributable runtime version of at least 14.38.33135 must be installed. These are installed automatically, if necessary, by the EXE installer provided but the MSI file doesn’t have this ability.
