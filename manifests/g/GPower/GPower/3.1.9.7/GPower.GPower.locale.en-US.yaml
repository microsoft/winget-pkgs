      By downloading G*Power you agree to these terms of use:
      
      G*Power is free for everyone. This includes people working in commercial environments.
      Commercial distribution is prohibited, that is, no-one is allowed to sell G*Power.
      You may use screenshots of G*Power without asking for permission.
      G*Power is distributed from this web page. If you wish to distribute G*Power in some other way, then you need to seek permission from the authors. Please send us an e-mail in which you specify how and for what purpose you intend to distribute G*Power.
      We do not provide licence agreements, security documentations or other documents of that type. This is so because we are researchers who simply do not have the time to fill out forms.
      The Windows version of G*Power needs runtime libraries belonging to the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler which it tries to download during installation if these libraries are not available on your Windows PC. Other than that, both the macOS and the Windows versions of G*Power run locally on your computer and do not communicate with any servers anywhere. 
      Considerable effort has been put into program development and evaluation, but there is no warranty whatsoever.
