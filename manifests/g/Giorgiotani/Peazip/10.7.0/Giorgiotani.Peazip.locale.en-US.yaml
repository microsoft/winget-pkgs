ReleaseNotes: |-
  PeaZip 10.7.0 improves the handling of errors and the capability to preview items in archives.
  This release also substantially improves the file manager: more capable dynamic virtual mode on macOS, ability to display image's thumbnails on all platforms, new option to show thumbnails on request, and new integrated text viewer and image viewer tools.
  The source code was extensively refactored in order to improve readability and maintainability, with rational renaming of the main units, forms, and most notable variables, grouping related functions in sub-sections in largest units, and moving functions to specialized units whenever possible.
  Backed are updated with Pea 1.27.
  Sources are compiled with new Lazarus 4.2, and are still compatible with Lazarus 3.x and 2.x.
  mac-img-viewer The new image viewer component; in background PeaZip for macOS, set to large icons mode, showing thumbnails of images.
