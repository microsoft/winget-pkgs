ShortDescription: A more convenient way to access SJTU Pan
Description: The program fills the gap between SJTU Pan (Tencent SMH) API and WebDAV protocol, allowing users to access SJTU Pan through WebDAV protocol and mount it as a network drive with Raidrive, which is perfectly integrated with File Explorer as if you are using a local drive.
