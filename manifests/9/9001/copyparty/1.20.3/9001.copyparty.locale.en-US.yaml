ReleaseNotes: |-
  - send-message-to-serverlog now also available as url-parameter ?smsg=foo
    - option smsg configures which HTTP-methods to allow; can be set to GET,POST but default is only POST because GET is dangerous (CSRF)
  🩹 bugfixes
  - #1227 dillo was not able to login because dillo is more standards-compliant than every other browser (nice)
  - a web-scraper which got banned for making malicious requests could remain banned for one request longer than intended (wait why did I fix this) ba67b279463530742cd7f1f1adcb738e66dad8aa
  - ?ls was still a bit jank 0a3a80725aecc9303782cdbf8afcfc12937b7c1d
  🌠 fun facts
  - this 6AM release was powered by void/mournfinale
  - was going to name the release "dilla på dillo" but somehow google-translate thinks that means "fuck on fuck" which would have been inappropriate
