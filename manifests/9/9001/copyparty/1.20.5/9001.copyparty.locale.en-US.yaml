  🔧 other changes
  - fast again! ed6a8d5a
    - replaced the connection:close band-aid added in v1.20.4 with a proper fix that doesn't make things slower behind reverseproxies
    - I've tried everything I can think of (with nginx as reverseproxy) and can't notice any difference in behavior, but please let me know if this breaks anything for you 🙏
  - #1245 updated Portuguese translation (thx @000yesnt!) 69fa1d10
  - #1259 OpenRC: add command to test config (thx @lotsospaghetti!) 79273a7d
  - #1257 removed the nth global-option because it was never implemented (thx @stackxp!) 22cdc0f8
  - syntax highlighter: added languages nasm + nix, removed autohotkey + cmake b20d3259
  🌠 fun facts
  - http/1.1 still tends to be faster than http/2 and http/3 for large transfers which is the main reason copyparty hasn't made the change
    - eh, not really a fun fact I suppose ┐( ´ w `)┌
