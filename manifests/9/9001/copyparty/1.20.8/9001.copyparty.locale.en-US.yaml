ReleaseNotes: |-
  - #1298 add Hungarian translation (thx @sonacl!) eefb181b f37c3b96
  - #1299 chown now accepts 4-digit values (thx @new-sashok724!) 5a7504fd
  🩹 bugfixes
  - audioplayer skip-silence:
    - #1303 clamp ffwd to safe values (thx @icxes!) f5e70c7f
    - fix crash on folderchange f1a433a6
  🔧 other changes
  - due to legal reasons, the docker-images and bootable flashdrive are now unable to create thumbnails of HEVC/h265 videos and heif/heic images 1bec91d1
    - this primarily means photos/videos taken with iphones (and maybe some samsung phones)
    - on the bright side, this has made the docker-images much smaller; ac is now half the size it used to be, and iv / dj are each 97 MiB smaller
  🌠 fun facts
  - if you wanna see your car doing its best impression of a frictionless spherical cow, I can warmly (heh) recommend the icy snowcoated countryroads of viken this weekend
    - goes oddly well with sakuraburst - deconstructing nature
