ReleaseNotes: |-
  - #1235 rightclick-menu: fix creating new files/folders in gridview (thx @SpaceXCheeseWheel!) ffca67f2
  🔧 other changes
  - #1229 updated the Esperanto translation (thx @slashdevslashurandom!) 1142ac25
  - #1232 shares: if an external domain is configured, then show both the LAN and external link for each share 81e5eb7b
  - #1231 when reverse-proxied, always connection:close (don't reuse tcp/uds connections) e1eff216 b4fddbc3
    - ^ was a nice reminder to not take every hint from the reverseproxy at face value, and a fresh socket for each request might help avoid such issues altogether
    - the expected performance impact from this change is near-zero for real use, even if benchmarks confirm a 50% drop in requests/sec in the absolute-worst-case (burst of cheap requests)
