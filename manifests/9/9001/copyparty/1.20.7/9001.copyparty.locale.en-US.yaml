ReleaseNotes: |-
  - now possible to upload/delete files while the filesystem-indexer is still busy d44ea245 0ca4c1bd
    - global-option fika decides which actions to allow while still indexing; default is upload+copy+delete
    - full deduplication is only guaranteed if this option is set blank, as dupes are allowed while indexing
  - #1266 browsers can request thumbnails as jxl images (thx @intelfx!) b2711e05 720c83b2 93ffc65c a65a30b1 a7a25deb 59de5e2c 16403d8c 48c10178 0e8913c2
    - the future is FINALLY here (sure took a while)
    - some notes on memory/RAM usage though -- it is fine on Alpine Linux, so docker is also fine, just don't enable mimalloc
      - jxl can be disabled with global-option th-no-jxl if necessary on baremetal deployments until libvips fixes this
  - #1265 audioplayer can "skip silence" now (thx @icxes!) 66949989
  - #1287 opensearch support for opds (thx @philips!) 84e687a0
  - #1276 option to allow editing of arbitrary file-extensions with only the read+write permissions 312f48e1 d6928380
    - option rw-edit is the comma-separated list of permitted extensions, default is md
  - #1288 option to customize the links copied when selecting files and pressing ctrl-c (thx @icxes!) e5d0a057
  - docker: add option to run an arbitrary script (for customizations and such) during startup bf01ca48

  - #1280 the custom rightclick-menu was enabled in the textfile viewer fc8a4b8e
