ReleaseNotes: |-
  This release brings several improvements to the BrightScript Simulator's file system handling. It upgrades the zenFS dependency, enhancing file operations and ensuring better compatibility with Roku applications. Key changes include saving paths in writable volumes with their original case, sharing temporary and cache file systems among threads, and improving the serialization of RoSGNode objects for inter-thread communication. Additionally, this update addresses issues related to audio playback, content loading, and node management within the SceneGraph framework.
