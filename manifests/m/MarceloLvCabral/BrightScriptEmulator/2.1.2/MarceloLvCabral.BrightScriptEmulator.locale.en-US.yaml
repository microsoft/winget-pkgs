ReleaseNotes: |-
  This release brings several bug fixes to the BrightScript Simulator by upgrading the brs-engine dependency to v2.0.4 with RSG extension v.0.0.4. Key fixes include preventing division by zero errors in roAudioMetadata, correcting font metric checks in roFontRegistry, and addressing rendering issues in Poster and Overhang components. Additionally, it resolves event handling problems in item components of ArrayGrid based nodes, allows assignment of roPath to String fields in Field, and prevents crashes in Task when updating fields with null.
