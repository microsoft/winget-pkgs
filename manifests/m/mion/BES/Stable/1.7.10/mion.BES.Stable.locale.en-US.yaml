ShortDescription: >
  A 20-year-old simple stupid tool since 2004Battle-tested Easy Solution (or
  whatever)
Description: >
  BES is a small tool that throttles the CPU usage of the process you "target":
  for instance, you can limit the CPU usage of a process which would use CPU
  100%, down to 50% (or any percentage you'd like). With this, you can use other
  programs comfortably while doing something CPU-intensive in the background.
  BES has also helped various gamers as a handy "anti-freeze" agent, though that
  is not the original purpose of BES.
