ShortDescription: An open-source custom bootstrapper for Roblox Studio that allows you to override files in Roblox Studio's directory, opt into development branches of Roblox, and experiment with Fast Flags.
Description: The Roblox Studio Mod Manager is an open-source alternative bootstrapper for Roblox Studio. It is intended for power users who want to make experimental changes/tweaks to Roblox Studio without those changes being overwritten, and experiment with new features of Roblox Studio before the general public.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Roblox (at some point) introduced a versioning scheme for FVariables separate from names.
  This update attempts to catch and include 99% or more of these when possible.
  For example, RenderEmissiveMask5 would only show up as RenderEmissiveMask in the flag editor, when it actually required that 5 at the end to work properly. This should no longer be the case.
  This change is also reflected in the client tracker:
