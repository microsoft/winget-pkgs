  Changes
  - Refreshed the logo again.
  - Fixed a crash when trying to type in the flag editor's search bar too quickly after the window unlocks.
  - Versions of Roblox Studio no longer supported by Roblox are now unlisted from the version selection list.
    - If you cannot live without this, you can add the launch option -allowUnsupported when running the executable.
    - You'll be greeted with a warning each time the version is loaded/selected, reminding you that its not supported anymore.
  Rationale
  I'm expecting this update to be controversial, so I want to explain why I'm making this change.
  Like a lot of you, I also was not a fan of Roblox Studio's new UI when it came out, it took some time for me to get used to where things were moved to and I found it quite annoying.
  But instead of rolling things back, I felt it was more productive to adjust to it, understand what Roblox was trying to accomplish with this refresh, and provide feedback on where I felt it needed improvement. As long as it wasn't missing features and it opens the door for better UX functionality in the future (the UI is now written in Luau!), I believed it would be a net positive for studio.
  Roblox did not ask me to make this change, I'm doing it on my own accord because I feel like I've been enabling an unhealthy use case pattern. I designed this tool with the intention of giving power users early access to new features. It was not my intention to let people dig their head into the sand and refuse to keep moving forward with the rest of us, even when there are issues and things Roblox could be doing better.
  I initially noticed this use case pattern when I saw people trying to keep the original C++ explorer around, but the issue really came to a head with the new studio design. I'm uncomfortable with allowing people to easily keep doing this without at least some reality checks and additional barriers to entry.
  I implore those of you who are still trying to use the old builds of Roblox Studio, please go provide some constructive feedback on the devforum announcement post:

  Thank you for understanding. Have a good day!
