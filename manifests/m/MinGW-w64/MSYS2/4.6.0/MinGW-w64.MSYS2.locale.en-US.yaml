ShortDescription: |-
  MSYS2 is a collection of tools and libraries providing you with an easy-to-use environment
  for building, installing and running native Windows software.
Description: |-
  MSYS2 isn't "one tool to rule them all", but tries to focus on what it's good at.
  It provides a native build environment, based on open source software, and makes
  you feel right at home when you are already comfortable with Linux. There are good
  reasons to use multiple different environments and tools for different tasks on Windows.
