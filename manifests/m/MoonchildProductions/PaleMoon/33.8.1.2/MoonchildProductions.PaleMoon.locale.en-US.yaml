ReleaseNotes: |-
  This is a bugfix update addressing issues with NPAPI plugins not working in v33.8.1.1.
  For safety reasons, plugins are now also by default set to "ask to activate". It is recommended you keep this default setting and only allow plugins to be activated specifically on the websites you intend to use them.
