ShortDescription: The best browser with fast site rendering, advanced privacy, a sleek design and innovative features.
Description: |-
  Pale Moon is an Open Source, Goanna-based web browser available for Microsoft Windows and Linux (with other operating systems in development), focusing on efficiency and ease of use.
  Pale Moon offers you a browsing experience in a browser completely built from its own, independently developed source that has been forked off from Firefox/Mozilla code a number of years ago, with carefully selected features and optimizations to improve the browser's stability and user experience, while offering full customization and a growing collection of extensions and themes to make the browser truly your own.

  General notes
    DiD This means that a fix is "Defense-in-Depth": It is a fix that does not apply to a (potentially) actively exploitable vulnerability in Pale Moon, but prevents future vulnerabilities caused by the same code, e.g. when surrounding code changes, exposing the problem, or when new attack vectors are discovered.
    Rejected security patchesThis means that patches were theoretically applicable to our code but considered undesirable, which could be due to unwanted changes in behavior, known regressions caused by the patches, or unnecessary risks for stability, security or privacy.

  V33.0.1 (2024-02-27)
    This is a bugfix and security update.
  Changes/fixes:
  - Removed site-specific override for Amazon.com due to breakage.
  - Fixed script timeout values that were inadvertently overridden in branding.
  - Fixed an issue where empty MIME type registrations would break some parts of the UI.
  - (Linux only) Pasting URLs to content now by default does not navigate to that URL.
  - If content-paste-navigation is enabled (via middlemouse.contentLoadURL), navigation is now restricted to pasting to active body type elements (to prevent unwanted navigation when pasting URLs to input boxes, for example).
  - Fixed a problem with JS modules preventing ExportEntries from working.
  - (Linux only) Fixed a build issue when building with a system-supplied cairo library (unsupported).
  - Fixed an issue where workers could lock up the browser with SetInterval with an out-of-bounds (too small) value. This is now clamped to 4ms matching the HTML spec.
  - Fixed a few usability issues with the built-in developer tools.
  - Fixed a potential crash in web workers.
  - Fixed a potential overflow issue in image maps.
  - Fixed a potential security issue with multi-part/mixed content (CVE-2024-1551).
  (from this point forward we will no longer list UXP Mozilla security patch summaries as they are mostly irrelevant)
