ShortDescription: The best browser with fast site rendering, advanced privacy, a sleek design and innovative features.
Description: |-
  Pale Moon is an Open Source, Goanna-based web browser available for Microsoft Windows and Linux (with other operating systems in development), focusing on efficiency and ease of use.
  Pale Moon offers you a browsing experience in a browser completely built from its own, independently developed source that has been forked off from Firefox/Mozilla code a number of years ago, with carefully selected features and optimizations to improve the browser's stability and user experience, while offering full customization and a growing collection of extensions and themes to make the browser truly your own.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  This is a minor release to address some critical issues in the new milestone.

  Changes/fixes:
  - Backed out the expat library update for causing memory inflation and browser hang issues on XUL/XML and SVG files with particularly large attributes.
  - Backed out the change of the Javascript PRNG for causing intermittent issues and crashes on 32-bit platforms.
  Both of these issues are being investigated and can hopefully re-land with the next development release.
