ShortDescription: The best browser with fast site rendering, advanced privacy, a sleek design and innovative features.
Description: |-
  Pale Moon is an Open Source, Goanna-based web browser available for Microsoft Windows and Linux (with other operating systems in development), focusing on efficiency and ease of use.
  Pale Moon offers you a browsing experience in a browser completely built from its own, independently developed source that has been forked off from Firefox/Mozilla code a number of years ago, with carefully selected features and optimizations to improve the browser's stability and user experience, while offering full customization and a growing collection of extensions and themes to make the browser truly your own.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  This is a small, critical update to address issues with the browser's stability and usability due to the 33.9.0 changes to X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff header parsing.
  Mac and FreeBSD will follow shortly when the maintainer has been able to build the update.
