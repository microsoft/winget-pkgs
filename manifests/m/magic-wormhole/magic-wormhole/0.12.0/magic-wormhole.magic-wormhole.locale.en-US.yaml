ReleaseNotes: |
  - A command like wormhole send /dev/fd0 can send the contents of the named block device (USB stick, SD card, floppy, etc), resulting in a plain file on the other side. (#323)
  - Change "accept this file?" default answer from no to yes. (#327 #330 #331)
  - Actually use tempfile for large directory transfers. This fixes a five-year old bug which prevents transfers of directories larger than available RAM by finally really building the temporary zipfile on disk. (#379)
  - Accept 'wss' for TLS-protected relay connections, which default to port 443 if no other port is accepted. A future release will change the public relay to use TLS. (#144)
  - Drop support for python3.4
  - Stall --verify long enough to send the verifier. This fixes a bug when both sides use --verify, the receiver uses tab-completion, the sender sees the verifier and waits for the user to confirm, but the receiver cannot show the verifier (enabling that confirmation) until the sender approves the transfer. (#349)

  This release also includes an incomplete implementation of the new "Dilation" API (see ticket #312 for details). In the future this will enable restarting interrupted transfers, tolerating changes in network address, bidirectional transfers in a long-running GUI/daemon process, and more. The protocol is not finalized, nor is it backward compatible with the old "Transit" protocol yet, so there is no CLI access so far. The code is present and tested to make sure it doesn't regress and for ease of development, but intrepid folks who want to try it out will need to write a client first (and be aware that the protocol may change out from under them). A future release will add compatibility negotiation with old clients and start using the new protocol.
