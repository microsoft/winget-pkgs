Description: |-
  Picto-Selector is a free tool for creating visual schedules. It is used by many teachers and parents. But there are also reports of people using it in daycare for elderly people.

  The download contains over 34000 pictos (images) translated to English, Dutch, German, French, Danish and Spanish. (Some pictos are also translated to Arabic, Swedish, Italian, Portuguese, Brazilian and Indonesian)

  Picto-Selector makes creating visual schedules easier by:
  * Fast search options to find the needed pictures
  * Automatic sizes, depending on the number of rows and columns
  * Reuse of earlier created schedules
  With Picto-Selector the time consuming cut, paste and editing in Word is over.

  At the main screen picto sheets can be viewed and added. Each sheet can be printed. Pictos can easily be selected from a list and placed between existing pictos, this makes it extremely easy to alter existing picto sheets.
