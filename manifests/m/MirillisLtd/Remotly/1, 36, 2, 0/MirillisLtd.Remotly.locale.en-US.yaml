ReleaseNotes: |-
  We have just release a new update that adds support for the upcoming Custom Relay (Connect Anywhere) server update.
  This update allows encapsulation of the already end-to-end encrypted stream (AES256) in TLS1.2 or TLS1.3 protocol.
  This improves software and hardware firewall interoperability.

  There is also an updated Custom Relay page available in the admin panel with a new "Password" field that allows protection of your custom relay from being used by someone who knows it's IP but is not allowed to do so. The password can either be left empty (legacy support for old relay's) or must be a strong 32 character password which is set in the relay's configuration file on the relay server.

  We strongly recommend to install the new relay version as soon as it will be available and use the password field.
  You can then share your custom relay server with your friends or co-workers by giving them the password which they need to enter when adding the custom relay server.

  Please check next week for the new Linux and Windows custom relay version and new installation guides.
