ReleaseNotes: |-
  One bigger new thing, dear users: I decided to start implementing brand new purely command line only version of RSS Guard to allow running RSS Guard in headless/CLI environments like servers. It will likely work like this:- You run regular variant of RSS Guard and setup your feeds, how often they fetch like you normally do when running classic GUI RSS Guard.
  - You then can launch new CLI-only RSS Guard executable perhaps on your server (or elsewhere) and it will load your settings/database and will perform article fetching regularly.
  Added:- Existing read/unread state is respected when some article gets "updated" (infamously happens for YouTube feeds). (#1279)
  - NSIS installer was bit tweaked to warn about MSVC runtime. (#1306)
  - iCalendar files (*.ics, *.ical) are now supported. Note that the support is rather basic.
  - Added more ways of limitting amount of articles in each feed. (#1270, #1267)
  - Added way to use old legacy article formatting in "lite" version. (#1286)
  - New way of fetching articles - new "Source" -> "Built-in web browser with JavaScript support" which allows user to use built-in Chromium-based network stack to fetch feeds and other data. It allows even fetching of majority of JavaScript-powered websites. (#1313)
  - More date/time strings for parsing some dates and times in articles.
  - "Title" column in article list is not directly resizable too. Last visible column auto-stretches to fit remaining space. (#1319)
  Fixed:- Fix freezing when feed uses crazy crazy loooong URL.
  - Fix crash when forwarding e-mail via Gmail plugin.
  - Add forgotten restriction when cleaning data. (a975714f6)
  - ETag conditional loading of feeds was semi-broken. (#1314, #1296)
  - All Unicode characters in feed URLs are now supported. (#1310)
  - Reader mode was changing content for all opened browser tabs. (#1300)
  - Some articles were displayed with broken HTML. (#1293)
  - Size/position of all windows (including modal dialogs) is now guarded to not be out-of-screen-bounds. (#1281)
  - No more crashes when adding some discovered feeds. (#1280)
  - Main window pesky splitters saved with 0 position. (#1271)
