ReleaseNotes: |-
  Added:
  - Added feed fetching throttle control: (#1154, #1322)
    - Too many requests HTTP codes are now recognized and respected by RSS Guard.
    - There is new per-account setting Feed fetch spacing which performs intelligent delaying of subsequent feed fetching from identical remote hosts, trying to avoid aforementioned errors/bans for making too many network requests in short time windows. The setting should be set to value low enough to avoid those kind of errors but still having good UX.
  - Custom color option for disabled feeds. (#1652)
  - Strikethrough for disabled feeds is optional. (#1651)
  - Ability to fetch feed icon from user entered URL. (#1645)
  - Application now remembers last used folder from any of its open/save file dialogs. (#1643)
  - HTTP/2 is now switchable on a per feed basis. (#1615)
  - Now duplicate keyboard shortcuts cannot be assigned. (#1605)
  - New option for colored/monochrome icons for tray icon. (#1603)
  - Article list filtering options are now persisting. (#1590)
  - Official binaries now use Qt 6.8.3.
  Fixed:
  - Enhanced QSS for tooltips for better readability. (#1637)
  - RSS feed encoding detection was prone to errors. (#1664)
  - Localization page now displays correctly. (#1611)
  - MariaDB backend now uses MEDIUMTEXT column to allow bigger articles.
  Removed:
  - Built-in Google API OAuth credentials are now REMOVED from official RSS Guard binaries. There are several reasons for this, including the fact that these credentials had low usage quotas, therefore were not suitable for bigger number of users. So now each user has to obtain his own client ID/SECRET from Google Cloud Platform (which is free for personal usage).
