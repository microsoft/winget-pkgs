ReleaseNotes: |-
  Users, this is one of the last RSS Guard releases from 4.x line. There might be more releases from 4.x but only bug-fixing ones.
  I will start working on new RSS Guard which will have many differences from current one and will aim to return to original goals of the application:
  - simplicity
  - good features
  - speed
  - stability
  Some features will be removed and while some of you will likely not be that happy, note that all this will help to keep RSS Guard development going in the future, ensuring we have maintainable, solid, expandable application. The development of RSS Guard is hugely understaffed. It is basically one-man project with some help of individual contributors.
