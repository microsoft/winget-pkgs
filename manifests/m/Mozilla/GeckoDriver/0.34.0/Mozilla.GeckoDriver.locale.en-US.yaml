  Known problems
  - Startup hang with Firefox running in a container (e.g. snap, flatpak):
    When Firefox is packaged inside a container (like the default Firefox browser shipped with Ubuntu 22.04), it may see a different filesystem to the host. This can affect access to the generated profile directory, which may result in a hang when starting Firefox. Workarounds are listed in the geckodriver usage documentation.
  Added
  - Support for Virtual Authenticators
    Virtual Authenticators serve as a WebDriver Extension designed to simulate user authentication (WebAuthn) on web applications during automated testing. This functionality encompasses a range of methods, including passwords, biometrics, and security keys.
    Geckodriver supports all available commands:
    - Add Virtual Authenticator
    - Remove Virtual Authenticator
    - Add Credential
    - Get Credentials
    - Remove Credential
    - Remove All Credentials
    - Set User Verified
  - Support for using a page range as integer for the Print command.
    Implemented by Mitesh Gulecha.
  Changed
  - The error handling has undergone refactoring, now utilizing the anyhow and thiserror crates.
    Implemented by James Hendry.
  - Specifying --port=0 as an argument allows geckodriver to dynamically find and use an available free port on the system.
  - Updated dependencies (base64, clap, rust-url)
  Fixed
  - While searching for a default Firefox installation on the system, geckodriver used the Contents/MacOS/firefox-bin executable instead of the binary specified in the app bundle's info.plist file. This behavior resulted in a malfunction due to a regression in Firefox, particularly affecting the Firefox 121 release.
  - The Firefox version check has been extended to enable the execution of distributions with custom prefixes for the application name.
    Implemented by Razvan Cojocaru.
  Removed
  - Removed the unknown path error which is not part of the WebDriver specification.
    Implemented by James Hendry.
