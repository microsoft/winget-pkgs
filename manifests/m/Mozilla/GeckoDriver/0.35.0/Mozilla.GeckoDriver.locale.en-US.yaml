  Known problems
  - Startup hang with Firefox running in a container (e.g. snap, flatpak):
    When Firefox is packaged inside a container (like the default Firefox browser shipped with Ubuntu 22.04), it may see a different filesystem to the host. This can affect access to the generated profile directory, which may result in a hang when starting Firefox. Workarounds are listed in the geckodriver usage documentation.
  Added
  - Support for Permissions that allow controlling permission prompts within the browser. This enables automated tests to handle scenarios involving permissions like geolocation, notifications, and more.
  - The command line flag --enable-crash-reporter has been added, to allow the crash reporter in Firefox to automatically submit crash reports to Mozilla's crash reporting system if a tab or the browser itself crashes.
    Note that this feature is disabled by default and should only be used when a crash situation needs to be investigated. See our documentation for crash reports in how to share these with us.
  Changed
  - The validation of the unhandledPromptBehavior capability has been enhanced to support finer configuration options for the User Prompt Handler which are particularly used by WebDriver BiDi.
  Fixed
  - The Switch To Frame command now correctly raises an "invalid argument" error when the id parameter is missing.
  Removed
  - Removed support for session negotiation using the deprecated desiredCapabilities and requiredCapabilities.
  - Removed support for the moz:useNonSpecCompliantPointerOrigin capability, which has not bee supported since Firefox 116.
