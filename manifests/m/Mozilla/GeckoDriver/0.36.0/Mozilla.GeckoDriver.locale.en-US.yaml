ReleaseNotes: |-
  Known problems
  - Startup hang with Firefox running in a container (e.g. snap, flatpak):
    When Firefox is packaged inside a container (like the default Firefox browser
    shipped with Ubuntu 22.04), it may see a different filesystem to the host.
    This can affect access to the generated profile directory, which may result
    in a hang when starting Firefox. Workarounds are listed in the geckodriver
    usage documentation.
  Added
  - Support for searching the Firefox Developer Editionâ€™s default path on macOS.
    Implemented by Gatlin Newhouse.
  - Ability to push a WebExtension archive as created from a base64 encoded string
    to an Android device.
  - Added an allowPrivateBrowsing field for POST /session/{session id}/moz/addon/install
    to allow the installation of a WebExtension that is enabled in Private Browsing mode.
  - Introduced the --allow-system-access command line argument for geckodriver, which will
    be required for future versions of Firefox (potentially starting with 138.0) to allow
    testing in the chrome context.
  - Added support for preserving crash dumps for crash report analysis when
    Firefox crashes. If the MINIDUMP_SAVE_PATH environment variable is set
    to an existing folder, crash dumps will be saved accordingly. For mobile
    devices, the generated minidump files will be automatically transferred
    to the host machine.
    For more details see the documentation of how to handle crash reports.
  Changed
  - Updated the type of the x and y fields of pointer move actions (mouse and touch)
    from integer to fractional numbers to ensure a more precise input control.
  - Replaced serde_yaml with yaml-rust because it's no longer officially supported.
  - The --enable-crash-reporter command line argument has been deprecated to
    prevent crash reports from being submitted to Socorro. This argument will be
    completely removed in the next version.
    Instead, use the MINIDUMP_SAVE_PATH environment variable to get minidump
    files saved to a specified location.
  Fixed
  - Fixed route registration for WebAuthn commands, which were introduced in
    geckodriver 0.34.0 but mistakenly registered under /sessions/ instead of
    /session/, causing them to be non-functional.
  Removed
  - Removed the -no-remote command-line argument usage for Firefox, which does no longer exist.
