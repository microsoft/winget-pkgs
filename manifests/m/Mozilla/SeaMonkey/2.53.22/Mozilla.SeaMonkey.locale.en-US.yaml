ShortDescription: Web-browser, advanced e-mail, newsgroup and feed client, IRC chat, and HTML editing made simple—all your Internet needs in one application.
Description: |-
  The SeaMonkey project is a community effort to develop the SeaMonkey all-in-one internet application suite. Such a software suite was previously made popular by Netscape and Mozilla, and the SeaMonkey project continues to develop and deliver high-quality updates as well as new features and improvements to this concept. Containing an Internet browser, email & newsgroup client, HTML editor, IRC chat and web development tools, SeaMonkey is sure to appeal to advanced users, web developers and corporate users.
  SeaMonkey is built on the open source Mozilla Gecko engine, the same code which underlies the highly successful Thunderbird and is the base for the Firefox browser. SeaMonkey benefits from the cross-fertilization with these other projects, by gaining (and contributing) new features and the ongoing security updates which are a modern necessity. The SeaMonkey Association provides legal backing for the SeaMonkey Project.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  SeaMonkey 2.53.22 Beta 1 is now available for free download on the SeaMonkey website.
  2.53.22 will be an incremental update on the 2.53.x branch and incorporates a number of enhancements, changes and fixes to the application as well as those from the underlying platform code. Before installing the new version make a full backup of your profile and thoroughly read and follow the Release Notes. We encourage testers to get involved in discussing and reporting problems as well as further improving the product.
  Our Windows signing key expired in January and the way new keys are distributed totally changed last year. We are currently working on acquiring a new key and integrating the new signing process into our infra, but it will take some time to complete. So until we accomplish this, starting with 2.53.21b1, our Windows releases will be distributed unsigned. If you are concerned about the integrity of the downloads please check the binaries against the checksum files we provide.
  2.53.22 will be the first release that does not have 32-bit x86 Windows and Linux versions. We suggest you test the beta to report any regressions which might have crept in so that we can fix them for the final version. The beta should have release quality and the final version can be installed over it.
  SeaMonkey 2.53.22 Beta 1 is available in 24 languages, for Windows x64, macOS x64 and Linux x64.
