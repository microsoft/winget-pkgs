ShortDescription: Web-browser, advanced e-mail, newsgroup and feed client, IRC chat, and HTML editing made simple—all your Internet needs in one application.
Description: |-
  The SeaMonkey project is a community effort to develop the SeaMonkey all-in-one internet application suite. Such a software suite was previously made popular by Netscape and Mozilla, and the SeaMonkey project continues to develop and deliver high-quality updates as well as new features and improvements to this concept. Containing an Internet browser, email & newsgroup client, HTML editor, IRC chat and web development tools, SeaMonkey is sure to appeal to advanced users, web developers and corporate users.
  SeaMonkey is built on the open source Mozilla Gecko engine, the same code which underlies the highly successful Thunderbird and is the base for the Firefox browser. SeaMonkey benefits from the cross-fertilization with these other projects, by gaining (and contributing) new features and the ongoing security updates which are a modern necessity. The SeaMonkey Association provides legal backing for the SeaMonkey Project.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  The SeaMonkey project is proud to present SeaMonkey 2.53.21: The new release of the all-in-one Internet suite is available for free download now!
  2.53.21 is an incremental update on the 2.53.x branch and incorporates a number of enhancements, changes and fixes to the application as well as those from the underlying platform code. We have also added many fixes and backports for overall platform stability.
  Please be advised that this is planned to be the last release with 32-bit versions for Windows and Linux, going forward we will only be releasing 64-bit versions.
  If you are using macOS 15.1.x please update to 15.2. Because of a bug in the OS SeaMonkey can not be started via Finder or Dock without workarounds. This applies to older versions too.
  We are aware of numerous websites breaking because of only supporting the latest Chrome or Firefox versions. We are trying to address this and progress has been made in a different source code branch but the code is not ready for general distribution yet.
  SeaMonkey 2.53.21 is available in 23 languages, for Windows, macOS x64 and Linux.
  Automatic upgrades from previous 2.53.x versions are enabled for this release, but if you have problems with it please download the full installer from the downloads section and install SeaMonkey 2.53.21 manually over the previous version.
  For a more complete list of major changes in SeaMonkey 2.53.21, see the What's New in SeaMonkey 2.53.21 section of the Release Notes, which also contains a list of known issues and answers to frequently asked questions. For a more general overview of the SeaMonkey project (and screen shots!), visit www.seamonkey-project.org.
  We encourage users to get involved in discussing and reporting problems as well as further improving the product.
