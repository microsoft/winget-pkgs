  Unbranded portable versions work just like Firefox，with 2 differences：they have a setting to disable mandatory signature checks，and they don't have the Firefox name or logo (instead using a generic name and logo). These builds are available in en-US only.

  Inside the builds, the "About" pages claim it's a Nightly version, while the version numbers and wiki claim it's a stable build. The reasons for this discrepancy is unclear.
