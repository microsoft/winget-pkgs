ShortDescription: Mozilla Firefox is free and open source software, built by a community
  of thousands from all over the world.
Description: 'Firefox Browser, also known as Mozilla Firefox or simply Firefox, is
  a free and open-source web browser developed by the Mozilla Foundation and its subsidiary,
  the Mozilla Corporation.

  Firefox uses the Gecko layout engine to render web pages, which implements current
  and anticipated web standards.

  In 2017, Firefox began incorporating new technology under the code name Quantum
  to promote parallelism and a more intuitive user interface.

  Firefox is officially available for Windows 7 or newer, macOS, and Linux.

  Its unofficial ports are available for various Unix and Unix-like operating systems
  including FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, illumos, and Solaris Unix.'
