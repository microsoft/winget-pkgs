ShortDescription: Mozilla Firefox is free and open source software, built by a community of thousands from all over the world.
Description: Firefox Browser, also known as Mozilla Firefox or simply Firefox, is a free and open-source web browser developed by the Mozilla Foundation and its subsidiary, the Mozilla Corporation. Firefox uses the Gecko layout engine to render web pages, which implements current and anticipated web standards. In 2017, Firefox began incorporating new technology under the code name Quantum to promote parallelism and a more intuitive user interface. Firefox is officially available for Windows 7 or newer, macOS, and Linux. Its unofficial ports are available for various Unix and Unix-like operating systems including FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, illumos, and Solaris Unix.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  New
  - Now Firefox can help you keep your tabs organized, automatically. A local AI model identifies similar tabs, automatically organizes them into groups, and even suggests group names. Everything happens on your device to respect your privacy. Learn more here.

    This feature is part of a progressive roll out.
    What is a progressive roll out?
    Certain new Firefox features are released gradually. This means some users will see the feature before everyone does. This approach helps to get early feedback to catch bugs and improve behavior quickly, meaning more Firefox users overall have a better experience.
  - Vertical tabs users can now adjust the size of the tools areas at the bottom of the sidebar. To see fewer tools and more tabs, drag down the divider line which pushes extra tools into an overflow menu.

  - On Linux, Firefox uses less memory and no longer requires a forced restart after an update has been applied by a package manager.
  - Address autofill has been enabled for users in Brazil, Spain and Japan.
  - The Firefox address bar can now be used as a unit converter. The unit converter supports converting units of length, temperature, mass, force, and angular measurement, as well as timezones (e.g. “now in GMT” , “10am EDT to CET”). Selecting the result will copy it to your clipboard.

  - Firefox builds in Valencian now come with a built-in Catalan (Valencian variant) dictionary for the Firefox spellchecker.
  - The following languages are now available for translation:
    - Albanian
    - Gujarati
    - Hebrew
    - Hindi
    - Kannada
    - Malay
    - Malayalam
    - Persian
    - Telugu

  Developer
  - Firefox will now also clear the back-forward-cache when receiving the Clear-Site-Data: "cache" response header.

  - Support for Cookies Having Independent Partitioned State (CHIPS) is now re-enabled, allowing developers to opt a cookie into storage partitioning per top-level site.
