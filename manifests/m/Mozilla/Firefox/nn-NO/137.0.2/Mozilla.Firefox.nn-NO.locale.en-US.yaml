ShortDescription: Mozilla Firefox is free and open source software, built by a community of thousands from all over the world.
Description: Firefox Browser, also known as Mozilla Firefox or simply Firefox, is a free and open-source web browser developed by the Mozilla Foundation and its subsidiary, the Mozilla Corporation. Firefox uses the Gecko layout engine to render web pages, which implements current and anticipated web standards. In 2017, Firefox began incorporating new technology under the code name Quantum to promote parallelism and a more intuitive user interface. Firefox is officially available for Windows 7 or newer, macOS, and Linux. Its unofficial ports are available for various Unix and Unix-like operating systems including FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, illumos, and Solaris Unix.

  Changed

  - Reference link to 137.0.1 release notes.
  Unresolved
  - Due to recent changes in Chrome on Windows, some users might find that the Firefox migration wizard no longer successfully imports passwords from Chrome or Chrome-based browsers. As a workaround, you can export your passwords as a CSV file from Chrome and then import them into Firefox using either the migration wizard or the Firefox password manager.
