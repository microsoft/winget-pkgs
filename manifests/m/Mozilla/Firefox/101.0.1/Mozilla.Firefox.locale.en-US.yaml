ShortDescription: Mozilla Firefox is free and open source software, built by a community of thousands from all over the world.
Description: |-
  Firefox Browser, also known as Mozilla Firefox or simply Firefox, is a free and open-source web browser developed by the Mozilla Foundation and its subsidiary, the Mozilla Corporation.
  Firefox uses the Gecko layout engine to render web pages, which implements current and anticipated web standards.
  In 2017, Firefox began incorporating new technology under the code name Quantum to promote parallelism and a more intuitive user interface.
  Firefox is officially available for Windows 7 or newer, macOS, and Linux.
  Its unofficial ports are available for various Unix and Unix-like operating systems including FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, illumos, and Solaris Unix.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Reading is now easier with the prefers-contrast media query, which allows sites to detect if the user has requested that web content is presented with a higher (or lower) contrast.
  - It's your choice! All non-configured MIME types can now be assigned a custom action upon download completion.
  - Firefox now allows users to use as many microphones as you want, at the same time, during video conferencing. The most exciting benefit is that you can easily switch your microphones at any time (if your conferencing service provider enables this flexibility).
