ReleaseNotes: |-
  New
  - Firefox now supports playback of protected content from streaming sites like Netflix while in Private Browsing mode.
  - Firefox now has a simpler and more unified dialog for clearing user data. In addition to streamlining data categories, the new dialog also provides insights into the site data size corresponding to the selected time range.
  - Microphone capture through getUserMedia on macOS will use system-provided voice processing when applicable for improved audio quality.
  - Firefox is now available in the Saraiki (skr) language.
  - Firefox for Android users on Android 14 or later can now create and use Passkeys in third-party Passkey management applications.
  - Firefox now has the ability to translate selections of text and hyperlinked text to other languages from the context menu.
  Fixed
  - Firefox now proxies DNS by default when using SOCKS v5, avoiding leaking DNS queries to the network when using SOCKS v5 proxies.
  Changed
  - Firefox now supports rendering more text/* file types inline, rather than requiring them to be downloaded to be viewed.
  Developer
  - CSS rules specificity is now displayed in a tooltip when hovering a CSS Rule selector in the Inspector Rules view. This can help web developers understand why a given rules is applied before another.
  Web Platform
  - The setCodecPreferences method allows applications to disable the negotiation of specific codecs (including RTX/RED/FEC). It also allows an application to cause a remote peer to prefer the codec that appears first in the list for sending.
  - The Accept header for images and documents was changed to better align with the Fetch standard and other browsers.
  - Firefox now supports @property and the CSS properties-and-values API.
  - Resizeable ArrayBuffers and Growable SharedArrayBuffers are now supported in SpiderMonkey. This allows the size of an ArrayBuffer to be changed without having to allocate a new buffer and copy data into it.
  - A new bytes() method is provided on many objects like Request/Response and Blob that provides a convenient way of getting an Uint8Array typed array.
