ReleaseNotes: |-
  New
  - When suggesting a default translation language, Firefox will now take into consideration languages you have previously used for translations.
  - Firefox will now temporarily remember when users grant permissions to sites (e.g. geolocation). Temporary permissions will be removed either after one hour or when the tab is closed.
  - Hovering the mouse over an unfocused tab will now display a visual preview of its contents.
  Changed
  - Deprecated HLS playlist support in Firefox for Android. Extended testing showed no adverse impact as newer playback technologies have been widely adopted by websites.
  Developer
  - As part of the ongoing updates to SVG 2, SVGGraphicsElement.nearestViewportElement and SVGGraphicsElement.farthestViewportElement have been officially removed. Please note that these properties have had deprecation warnings since February.
  - Firefox now supports text fragments, which allows users to link directly to a specific portion of text in a web document via a special URL fragment. (Learn more)
  Web Platform
  - Support for Cookies Having Independent Partitioned State (CHIPS) was now added, allowing developers to opt a cookie into storage partitioned per top-level site. (Learn more)
