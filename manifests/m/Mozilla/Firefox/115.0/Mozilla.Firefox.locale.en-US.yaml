ShortDescription: Mozilla Firefox is free and open source software, built by a community of thousands from all over the world.
Description: |-
  Firefox Browser, also known as Mozilla Firefox or simply Firefox, is a free and open-source web browser developed by the Mozilla Foundation and its subsidiary, the Mozilla Corporation.
  Firefox uses the Gecko layout engine to render web pages, which implements current and anticipated web standards.
  In 2017, Firefox began incorporating new technology under the code name Quantum to promote parallelism and a more intuitive user interface.
  Firefox is officially available for Windows 7 or newer, macOS, and Linux.
  Its unofficial ports are available for various Unix and Unix-like operating systems including FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, illumos, and Solaris Unix.

ReleaseNotes: |
  - Migrating from another browser? Now you can bring over payment methods you've saved in Chrome-based browsers to Firefox.
  - Hardware video decoding is now enabled for Intel GPUs on Linux.
  - The Tab Manager dropdown now features close buttons, so you can close tabs more quickly.
  - We've refreshed and streamlined the user interface for importing data in from other browsers.
  - Users without platform support for H264 video decoding can now fallback to Cisco's OpenH264 plugin for playback.
  - Windows Magnifier now follows the text cursor correctly when the Firefox title bar is visible.
  - Windows users on low-end/USB wifi drivers and with OS geolocation disabled can now approve geolocation on a case by case basis without causing system-wide network instability.
  - Various security fixes.
  - Undo and redo are now available in Password fields.
  - On Linux, middle clicks on the new tab button will now open the xclipboard contents in the new tab. If the xclipboard content is a URL then that URL is opened, any other text is opened with your default search provider.
  - For users with a Firefox Colorways built-in theme, the theme will be automatically migrated to the same theme hosted on addons.mozilla.org for Firefox profiles that have disabled add-ons auto-updates. This will allow users to keep their Colorways theme when they are later removed from Firefox installer files.
  - Certain Firefox users may come across a message in the extensions panel indicating that their add-ons are not allowed on the site currently open. We have introduced a new back-end feature to only allow some extensions monitored by Mozilla to run on specific websites for various reasons, including security concerns.
  - You can find information about policy updates and enterprise specific bug fixes in the Firefox for Enterprise 115 Release Notes.
  - "In web development, we rely on third-party libraries which you may not be interested in while debugging. These can be ignored. Ignoring them means that breakpoints will not get hit and they are skipped during stepping.  \nYou can now choose to Hide ignore-listed sources in the Developer Tools source tree (bug). \n \nIgnored sources are also skipped by JavaScript tracing feature (bug)."
  - We have introduced a new option, devtools.f12_enabled, that can be utilized to prevent the accidental use of the F12 key, which opens the DevTools toolbox (bug).
  - "The builtin editor now behaves similarly to other browsers with contenteditable and designMode when splitting a node, e.g. typing Enter to split a paragraph, and also when joining two nodes, e.g. typing Backspace at the start of a paragraph to join the paragraph and the previous one. \nWhen a node is split, the builtin editor creates a new node after the original one instead of before, i.e. creates the right node instead of the left node. \nSimilarly, when two nodes are joined, the builtin editor deletes the latter node and moves its children to the end of the preceding node instead of deleting the former node and moving its child to the start of the following node."
  - WebRTC application developers can now specify a target in milliseconds of media for the jitter buffer to hold. Altering the target value allows applications to control the tradeoff between playout delay and the risk of running out of audio or video fraalso in private browsingmes due to network jitter.
  - Change array by copy provides additional methods on Array.prototype and TypedArray.prototype to enable changes on the array by returning a new copy of it with the change.
  - The animation-composition property is now supported, allowing a declarative way to define the composite operation used when multiple animations affect the same property simultaneously.
  - Added the URL.canParse() function to allow easy and fast checking if URLs are valid and parseable.
  - IndexedDB is now also supported in private browsing without memory limits thanks to encrypted storage on disk. The temporary keys to decrypt the information are hold in RAM only and all stored information is purged at the normal end of a private browsing session from disk.
  - Supports conditions are now supported in CSS import rules @import supports(...)
  - "With the release of Firefox 115, we are pleased to welcome the developers who contributed their first code change to Firefox in this release, 8 of whom were brand new volunteers!  \nPlease join us in thanking each of these diligent and enthusiastic individuals, and take a look at their contributions: \n \nAnton Bobrov: 1833330 \nBrice Laurencin: 1418462 \nLyScott123: 1788013 \nMart├¡n Gonz├ílez G├│mez: 1827565 \nmichael s: 1787997 \nSam Kravitz: 1832402 \nsankalp.shubham99: 1831587 \nTom Marble: 1832629"
