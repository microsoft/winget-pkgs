ShortDescription: Mozilla Firefox is free and open source software, built by a community of thousands from all over the world.
Description: |-
  Firefox Browser, also known as Mozilla Firefox or simply Firefox, is a free and open-source web browser developed by the Mozilla Foundation and its subsidiary, the Mozilla Corporation.
  Firefox uses the Gecko layout engine to render web pages, which implements current and anticipated web standards.
  In 2017, Firefox began incorporating new technology under the code name Quantum to promote parallelism and a more intuitive user interface.
  Firefox is officially available for Windows 7 or newer, macOS, and Linux.
  Its unofficial ports are available for various Unix and Unix-like operating systems including FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, illumos, and Solaris Unix.

ReleaseNotes: |
  - Right-clicking on password fields now shows an option to reveal the password.
  - Ubuntu Linux users can now import their browser data from the Chromium Snap package. Currently, this will only work if Firefox is not also installed as a Snap package, but work is underway to address this!
  - Do you use the tab list panel in the tab bar? If so, you can now close tabs by middle-clicking items in that list.
  - You've always been able to un-close a tab by using (Cmd/Ctrl)-Shift-T. Now, that same shortcut will restore the previous session if there are no more closed tabs from the same session to re-open.
  - For all ETP Strict users, we extended the list of known tracking parameters that are removed from URLs to further protect our users from cross-site tracking.
  - Enables overlay of software-decoded video on Intel GPUs in Windows. Improves video down scaling quality and reduces GPU usage.
  - Private windows and ETP set to strict will now include email tracking protection. This will make it harder for email trackers to learn the browsing habits of Firefox users. You can check the Tracking Content in the sub-panel on the shield icon panel.
  - Various security fixes.
  - The deprecated U2F Javascript API is now disabled by default. The U2F protocol remains usable through the WebAuthn API. The U2F API can be re-enabled using the security.webauth.u2f preference.
  - You can find information about policy updates and enterprise specific bug fixes in the Firefox for Enterprise 112 Release Notes.
  - Clear button, newly added to the date picker panel, allows users to quickly clear the input with type date or datetime-local and provides a familiar experience across browsers.
