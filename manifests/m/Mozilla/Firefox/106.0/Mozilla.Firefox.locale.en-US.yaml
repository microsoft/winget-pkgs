ShortDescription: Mozilla Firefox is free and open source software, built by a community of thousands from all over the world.
Description: |-
  Firefox Browser, also known as Mozilla Firefox or simply Firefox, is a free and open-source web browser developed by the Mozilla Foundation and its subsidiary, the Mozilla Corporation.
  Firefox uses the Gecko layout engine to render web pages, which implements current and anticipated web standards.
  In 2017, Firefox began incorporating new technology under the code name Quantum to promote parallelism and a more intuitive user interface.
  Firefox is officially available for Windows 7 or newer, macOS, and Linux.
  Its unofficial ports are available for various Unix and Unix-like operating systems including FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, illumos, and Solaris Unix.

ReleaseNotes: |
  - It is now possible to edit PDFs: including writing text, drawing, and adding signatures.
  - Setting Firefox as your default browser now also makes it the default PDF application on Windows systems.
  - You can now pin private windows to your Windows taskbar on Window 10 and Windows 11 for simpler access. Also, private windows have been redesigned to increase the feeling of privacy.
  - Swipe-to-navigate (two fingers on a touchpad swiped left or right to perform history back or forward) now works for Linux users on Wayland.
  - Text Recognition in images allows users on macOS 10.15 and higher to extract text from the selected image (such as a meme or screenshot). Extracted text is copied to the clipboard in order to share, store, or search—without needing to manually retype everything.
  - "Firefox View" helps you get back to content you previously discovered. A pinned tab allows you to find and open recently closed tabs on your current device, access tabs from other devices (via our “Tab Pickup” feature), and change the look of the browser (with Colorways).
  - With the launch of the “Independent Voices” collection, Firefox is introducing 18 new “Colorways.” You can now access a “Colorways” modal experience via “Firefox View”; each new color is accompanied with a bespoke graphic and a text description that speaks to its deeper meaning. The collection will be available through Jan 16.
  - A major upgrade to our WebRTC capabilities (libwebrtc library upgraded from version 86 to 103) brings multiple improvements:
        - Better screen sharing for Windows and Linux Wayland users.
        - Lower CPU usage and increased frame rates during WebRTC screen capture on macOS.
        - RTP performance and reliability improvements.
        - Richer statistics.
        - Cross-browser and service compatibility improvements.
