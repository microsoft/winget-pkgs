ReleaseNotes: |-
  New
  • Firefox has a new optimized download flow. Instead of prompting every time, files will download automatically. However, they can still be opened from the downloads panel with just one click.
  • Firefox allows users to choose from a number of built-in search engines to set as their default. In this release, some users who had previously configured a default engine might notice their default search engine has changed since Mozilla was unable to secure formal permission to continue including certain search engines in Firefox.
  
  Fixed
  • Now, you can set a default app to open a file type. Choose the application you want to use to open files of a specific type in your Firefox settings.
  • After updating to Firefox version 98, "Always ask" download actions will now be reset.
  • Various security fixes.
  
  Enterprise
  • Various bug fixes and new policies have been implemented in the latest version of Firefox. You can find more information in the Firefox for Enterprise 98 Release Notes.
