ShortDescription: Mozilla Firefox is free and open source software, built by a community of thousands
  from all over the world.
Description: >-
  Firefox Browser, also known as Mozilla Firefox or simply Firefox, is a free and open-source web browser
  developed by the Mozilla Foundation and its subsidiary, the Mozilla Corporation. Firefox uses the Gecko
  layout engine to render web pages, which implements current and anticipated web standards. In 2017,
  Firefox began incorporating new technology under the code name Quantum to promote parallelism and a
  more intuitive user interface. Firefox is officially available for Windows 7 or newer, macOS, and Linux.
  Its unofficial ports are available for various Unix and Unix-like operating systems including FreeBSD,
  OpenBSD, NetBSD, illumos, and Solaris Unix.

ReleaseNotes: "- Gradually rolling out in Fx119,  Firefox View includes more content. You can now see\
  \ all open tabs, from all windows. If you sync open tabs, youâ€™ll see all tabs from other devices. Browsing\
  \ history is now listed and you can sort by date or by site. As before, recently closed tabs are also\
  \ listed on Firefox View.\n- To access Firefox View, select the file folder icon at the top left of\
  \ your tab strip.\n- \n- Gradually rolling out in Fx119, Firefox now allows you to edit PDFs by adding\
  \ images and alt text, in addition to text and drawings.\n- \n- Recently closed tabs now persist between\
  \ sessions that don't have automatic session restore enabled. Manually restoring a previous session\
  \ will continue to reopen any previously open tabs or windows.\n- If you're migrating your data from\
  \ Chrome, Firefox now offers the ability to import some of your extensions as well.\n- As part of Total\
  \ Cookie Protection, Firefox now supports the partitioning of Blob URLs, this mitigates a potential\
  \ tracking vector that third-party agents could use to track an individual.\n- The visibility of fonts\
  \ to websites has been restricted to system fonts and language pack fonts in Enhanced Tracking Protection\
  \ strict mode to mitigate font fingerprinting.\n- The Storage Access API web standard was updated to\
  \ improve security while mitigating website breakages and further enabling the phase out of third-party\
  \ cookies in Firefox.\n- Encrypted Client Hello (ECH) is now available to Firefox users, delivering\
  \ a more private browsing experience. ECH extends the encryption used in TLS connections to cover more\
  \ of the handshake and better protect sensitive fields. Read more about the launch of ECH on Mozilla\
  \ Distilled.\n- Media sniffing is no longer applied to files served as type application/octet-stream,\
  \ this allows these files to be downloaded instead of attempting playback.\n- On Windows, the mouse\
  \ pointer will disappear while typing if the relevant Windows mouse properties system setting is enabled.\n\
  - Firefox is now available in the Santali (sat) language.\n- Fixed an issue causing unexpected jumps\
  \ in scroll position on Facebook.\n- Various security fixes.\n- You can find information about policy\
  \ updates and enterprise specific bug fixes in the Firefox for Enterprise 119 Release Notes.\n- Several\
  \ enhancements have been made to the Inactive CSS styles feature. This feature assists in identifying\
  \ CSS properties that have no effect on an element. Pseudo-elements such as ::first-letter, ::cue, and\
  \ ::placeholder are now fully supported.\n- The JSON viewer is particularly useful for debugging REST\
  \ APIs, as it displays formatted JSON responses. Now, if the JSON is invalid or broken, it automatically\
  \ switches to a raw data view, improving the user experience.\n- ARIA reflection for simple attributes\
  \ and default Accessibility Semantics for Custom Elements are now supported. Note this includes boolean,\
  \ enum, number, and string attributes, but not attributes that reference other elements.\n- credentialless\
  \ is now supported in Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy.\n- The CSS attr() function now supports a fallback\
  \ parameter, for example attr(foobar, \"Default value\").\n- Grouping of items in an array (and iterables)\
  \ is now easier by using the methods Object.groupBy or Map.groupBy.\n- With the release of Firefox 119,\
  \ we are pleased to welcome the developers who contributed their first code change to Firefox in this\
  \ release, 4 of whom were brand new volunteers! Please join us in thanking each of these diligent and\
  \ enthusiastic individuals, and take a look at their contributions:"
