ShortDescription: Mozilla Firefox is free and open source software, built by a community of thousands from all over the world.
Description: Firefox Browser, also known as Mozilla Firefox or simply Firefox, is a free and open-source web browser developed by the Mozilla Foundation and its subsidiary, the Mozilla Corporation. Firefox uses the Gecko layout engine to render web pages, which implements current and anticipated web standards. In 2017, Firefox began incorporating new technology under the code name Quantum to promote parallelism and a more intuitive user interface. Firefox is officially available for Windows 7 or newer, macOS, and Linux. Its unofficial ports are available for various Unix and Unix-like operating systems including FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, illumos, and Solaris Unix.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  New
  - Focus on just one tab in a group without the clutter. Your active tab now stays in view, keeping things tidy even with the group collapsed.

  - We’re excited to share another tab groups update that addresses a top request from our community! You can now drag a tab into a collapsed group without automatically expanding it. It’s a quick way to stay organized while minimizing visual distractions.
  - Profile management, now available to all users globally, helps protect your privacy and stay focused by separating your online life into distinct profiles — for work, school, vacation planning, or whatever you choose. You can now name your profiles and customize them with avatars and color themes for easy recognition, then quickly switch between them — all while keeping bookmarks, tabs, and browsing history completely separate.

  - You can now close a Picture-in-Picture window without pausing the video. Press Shift + Click on the close button or use Shift + Esc to exit while keeping playback uninterrupted.
  - Logins stored in the Firefox Password Manager are now encrypted on disk using a modern encryption scheme (AES-256-CBC), replacing the older 3DES-CBC. This change improves local data protection. Logins synced through Firefox Sync remain end-to-end encrypted and already use AES-256-GCM.
  - Visual search powered by Google Lens
    With just a right-click on any image, you can now:
    ✨ Find similar products, places, or objects
    ✨ Copy, translate, or search text from images
    ✨ Get inspiration for learning, travel, or shopping
    Look for the new “Search Image with Google Lens” option in your right-click menu (highlighted with a NEW badge at first).
    This is a desktop-only feature, available worldwide. Your default search engine must be set to Google in order to use it.

  - Perplexity AI Search in Firefox
    On desktop, Firefox now includes Perplexity, an AI-powered answer engine built into the browser. Perplexity delivers direct, conversational answers to complex questions, helping you get quick summaries, accurate references, or creative inspiration without digging through multiple sources. It’s available worldwide from the address bar via the unified search button.
  - The following languages are now available for translation:
    - Azerbaijani
    - Bangla
    - Icelandic
  Fixed
  - Various security fixes.
  - The following languages have improved translation quality:
    - Arabic
    - Bulgarian
    - Catalan
    - Chinese (Simplified)
    - Czech
    - Dutch
    - Estonian
    - Finnish
    - French
    - German
    - Hungarian
    - Italian
    - Japanese
    - Portuguese
    - Persian
    - Spanish
    - Ukrainian
  Changed
  - On Windows, when opening a link from another application, Firefox will only use a window on the current virtual desktop or open a new window if needed.
  Enterprise
  - You can find information about policy updates and enterprise specific bug fixes in the Firefox for Enterprise 144 Release Notes.
  Developer
  - You can now jump to a CSS custom property's definition from within the var() function in style rules.
  - The events tooltip in the Inspector now shows a badge besides custom events, making it easier to differentiate them from built-in events.
  Web Platform
  - Firefox now supports the Element.moveBefore API.
  - Firefox now supports math-shift compact.
  - Firefox now supports PerformanceEventTiming.interactionId, allowing developers to group related input events. This enables support for the Interaction to Next Paint (INP) responsiveness metric.
  - Firefox now supports the command and commandfor attributes.
  - Firefox now supports the View Transitions API Level 1. The View Transitions API provides a mechanism for easily creating animated transitions between different website views.
  - Dithering is now applied when linear-gradient, conic-gradient, and radial-gradient are rendered using hardware WebRender.
  - Firefox now supports the upsert proposal. This adds getOrInsert and getOrInsertComputed methods to Map and WeakMap. These methods either return the value associated with a key, or insert a default value, and then return that value, simplifying handling of cases where it's not known if a key is already present in the Map or WeakMap.
  - Firefox now supports the lock() and unlock() methods of ScreenOrientation interface on Windows tablets and Android devices.
  - Firefox now supports worker transfer for RTCDataChannel.
  - Firefox now supports the resizeMode getUserMedia constraint, allowing developers to crop and downscale video captured from a camera to any resolution they choose.
  - Firefox now supports the WebGPU GPUDevice.importExternalTexture API on Windows.
  - WebCodecs on Windows now has a batch-encoding path for VideoEncoder, improving performance with higher throughput and lower submission latency due to a larger default batch size.
  - Gecko-specific CSS2Properties was renamed to CSSStyleProperties, to align with the latest web standard and for better interoperability with other browser engines.
