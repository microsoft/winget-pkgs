ShortDescription: Mozilla Firefox is free and open source software, built by a community of thousands from all over the world.
Description: |-
  Firefox Browser, also known as Mozilla Firefox or simply Firefox, is a free and open-source web browser developed by the Mozilla Foundation and its subsidiary, the Mozilla Corporation.
  Firefox uses the Gecko layout engine to render web pages, which implements current and anticipated web standards.
  In 2017, Firefox began incorporating new technology under the code name Quantum to promote parallelism and a more intuitive user interface.
  Firefox is officially available for Windows 7 or newer, macOS, and Linux.
  Its unofficial ports are available for various Unix and Unix-like operating systems including FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, illumos, and Solaris Unix.

ReleaseNotes: |
  - Sidebar switcher allows users to access Bookmarks, History and Synced Tabs panels easily, quickly switch between them, move the sidebar to another side of the browser window, or close the sidebar. Now, keyboard users would be able to do it all with ease too, with or without any assistive technology running, without needing to memorize keyboard shortcuts to access these panels.
  - When an update is available in English locales, users will now have access to the release notes in the update notification prompt in the form of a "Learn More" link.
  - It is now possible to copy any file from your operating system and paste it into Firefox.
  - You asked, and we listened! The volume slider is now available in Picture-in-Picture.
  - We added the possibility to edit existing text annotations.
  - The upload performance of HTTP/2 has been significantly improved starting with Firefox 115.0, particularly on those with a higher bandwidth delay product (i.e., networks characterized by both high bandwidth and high latency).
  - Various security fixes.
  - The keyboard shortcut to reopen closed tabs (command + shift + t) now reopens last closed tab or last closed window, in the order items were closed. If there aren't any tabs or windows to reopen, this command restores the previous session. This change is in anticipation of upcoming changes to recently closed tabs.
  - You can find information about policy updates and enterprise specific bug fixes in the Firefox for Enterprise 116 Release Notes.
  - Developer Information
  - Added support for the dirname attribute to pass text directionality information about input and textarea elements to the server. (learn more)
  - Firefox now supports CSP3 external hashes.
  - |-
    The Audio Output Devices API now enables sites to redirect audio from media elements to permitted output devices (speakers) other than the system default for the user-agent.
    For example, WebRTC conferencing sites can now redirect audio either to the speakers in a headset or to external speakers.
  - With custom formatters, websites can now define how to display specific JavaScript objects and functions within different parts of the DevTools. This feature is disabled by default and can be enabled via the Settings panel. (Learn more)
  - 'This release now supports proper BYOB readers on Fetch and WebTransport, which allows developers to prepare their ArrayBuffer so that it can be reused for read requests and thus saves memory allocation. .getReader({ mode: "byob" }) on Fetch and WebTransport streams was supported on previous releases but without true BYOB support, as new memory allocation still occurred internally.'
  - "With the release of Firefox 116, we are pleased to welcome the developers who contributed their first code change to Firefox in this release, 9 of whom were brand new volunteers!
