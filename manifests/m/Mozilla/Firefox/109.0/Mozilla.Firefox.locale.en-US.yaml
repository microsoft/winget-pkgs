ShortDescription: Mozilla Firefox is free and open source software, built by a community of thousands from all over the world.
Description: |-
  Firefox Browser, also known as Mozilla Firefox or simply Firefox, is a free and open-source web browser developed by the Mozilla Foundation and its subsidiary, the Mozilla Corporation.
  Firefox uses the Gecko layout engine to render web pages, which implements current and anticipated web standards.
  In 2017, Firefox began incorporating new technology under the code name Quantum to promote parallelism and a more intuitive user interface.
  Firefox is officially available for Windows 7 or newer, macOS, and Linux.
  Its unofficial ports are available for various Unix and Unix-like operating systems including FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, illumos, and Solaris Unix.

ReleaseNotes: |
  - Manifest Version 3 (MV3) extension support is now enabled by default (MV2 remains enabled/supported). This major update also ushers an exciting user interface change in the form of the new extensions button.
  - The Arbitrary Code Guard exploit protection has been enabled in the media playback utility processes, improving security for Windows users.
  - The native HTML date picker for date and datetime inputs can now be used with a keyboard alone, improving its accessibility for screen reader users. Users with limited mobility can also now use common keyboard shortcuts to navigate the calendar grid and month selection spinners.
  - Firefox builds in the Spanish from Spain (es-ES) and Spanish from Argentina (es-AR) locales now come with a built-in dictionary for the Firefox spellchecker.
  - Various security fixes.
  - Effective on January 16, Colorways will no longer be in Firefox. Users will still be able to access saved and active Colorways from the Add-ons and themes menu option.
  - On macOS, Ctrl or Cmd + trackpad or mouse wheel now scrolls the page instead of zooming. This avoids accidental zooming and matches the behavior of other web browsers on macOS.

  - The empty state messages and graphic components surfaced in Firefox View for the Tab Pickup and Recently Closed sections have been updated for an improved user experience.

  - The ability to automatically break when code on the page hits an events handler has been available since Firefox 69. Firefox 109 now adds new support for the scrollend event. To use this new event breakpoint, open the JS debugger and find and expand the Event Listener Breakpoints section in the right hand column (learn more).
  - The scrollend event is now enabled by default. The event is fired when a scroll has completed.
  - Firefox now permanently partitions Storage in third-party contexts independent of Storage Access to align with other browsers and provide better Web compatibility.
