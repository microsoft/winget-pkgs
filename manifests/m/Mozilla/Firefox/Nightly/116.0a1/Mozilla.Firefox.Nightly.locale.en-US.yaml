ShortDescription: Get a sneak peek at our next generation web browser, and help us make it the best browser
Description: Firefox Nightly is an experimental version of the Firefox web browser that is updated daily with the latest features, improvements, and bug fixes. It is used primarily by developers and enthusiasts who want to test and provide feedback on the latest features before they are released to the public. Nightly includes new features that may not yet be ready for release and may be unstable or have bugs that could affect the browsing experience. However, it is also a way to experience cutting-edge browser features before they are widely available.
