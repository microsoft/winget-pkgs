ShortDescription: Mozilla Firefox is free and open source software, built by a community of thousands from all over the world.
Description: Firefox Browser, also known as Mozilla Firefox or simply Firefox, is a free and open-source web browser developed by the Mozilla Foundation and its subsidiary, the Mozilla Corporation. Firefox uses the Gecko layout engine to render web pages, which implements current and anticipated web standards. In 2017, Firefox began incorporating new technology under the code name Quantum to promote parallelism and a more intuitive user interface. Firefox is officially available for Windows 7 or newer, macOS, and Linux. Its unofficial ports are available for various Unix and Unix-like operating systems including FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, illumos, and Solaris Unix.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  New
  - For users in the United States, article recommendations on your New Tab page are now grouped into topic sections like Sports, Food, and Entertainment to make stories more organized and easier to scan. You can also follow topics you’re interested in and block ones you’d prefer not to see, giving you more control over what shows up when you open a new tab.

    This feature is part of a progressive roll out.
    What is a progressive roll out?
    Certain new Firefox features are released gradually. This means some users will see the feature before everyone does. This approach helps to get early feedback to catch bugs and improve behavior quickly, meaning more Firefox users overall have a better experience.
  - You can now see what’s behind a link before visiting it with Link Previews. Long press a link (or right-click and choose Preview Link). Previews can optionally include AI-generated key points, which are processed on your device to protect your privacy.
    Link Previews is gradually rolling out to ensure performance and quality and is now available in en-US, en-CA, en-GB, en-AU for users with more than 3 GB of available RAM.

  - On Windows, clicking a persistent notification when Firefox is closed or restarted will now properly open Firefox with the relevant webpage, instead of just opening the main page of the website.
  - ETP Strict mode now supports a flexible exception list to fix broken site features caused by tracker blocking. Exceptions are split into baseline (core functionality) and convenience (extra features), letting users choose improved site compatibility without compromising key privacy protections.
  - Keep an active tab visible in a collapsed tab group
    Focus on just one tab in a group without the clutter. Your active tab stays in view, keeping things tidy even with the group collapsed.
  - You can now remove extensions from the sidebar by right-clicking the extension icon and selecting Remove from Sidebar.
  Fixed
  - Improved the scroll speed in the bookmarks dialog to not go beyond the component area.
  - Improved drag-and-drop support for blob images.
  - Various security fixes.
  Changed
  - Improved search results from browsing history via the address bar, reducing the likelihood of duplicate results being shown.
  - Improved Netmonitor so that Request Headers/Cookies/Params are displayed in the Network panel even if the request isn't finished yet.
  Enterprise
  - You can find information about policy updates and enterprise-specific bug fixes in the Firefox for Enterprise 142 Release Notes.
  Developer
  - Firefox now supports the wllama API for extensions, enabling developers to integrate local language model (LLM) capabilities directly into their add-ons.
  - The Debugger now offers a new setting to control whether the debugger overlay is shown during paused script execution.

  - Firefox now supports the Prioritized Task Scheduling API, enabling developers to assign and manage task priorities.
  - The Selection.getComposedRanges() API is now available, allowing developers to accurately get selected text ranges across shadow DOM boundaries.
