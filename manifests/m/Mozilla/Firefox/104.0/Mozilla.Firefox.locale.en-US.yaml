ShortDescription: Mozilla Firefox is free and open source software, built by a community of thousands from all over the world.
Description: |-
  Firefox Browser, also known as Mozilla Firefox or simply Firefox, is a free and open-source web browser developed by the Mozilla Foundation and its subsidiary, the Mozilla Corporation.
  Firefox uses the Gecko layout engine to render web pages, which implements current and anticipated web standards.
  In 2017, Firefox began incorporating new technology under the code name Quantum to promote parallelism and a more intuitive user interface.
  Firefox is officially available for Windows 7 or newer, macOS, and Linux.
  Its unofficial ports are available for various Unix and Unix-like operating systems including FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, illumos, and Solaris Unix.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Subtitles are now available for Disney+ in Picture-in-Picture.
  - Firefox now supports both the scroll-snap-stop property as well as re-snapping. You can use the scroll-snap-stop property's always and normal values to specify whether or not to pass the snap points, even when scrolling fast. Re-snapping tries to keep the last snap position after any content/layout changes.
  - The Firefox profiler can analyze power usage of a website (Apple M1 and Windows 11 only).
  - The Firefox UI itself will now be throttled for performance and battery usage when minimized or occluded, in the same way background tabs are.
  - Highlight color is preserved correctly after typing Enter in the mail composer of Yahoo Mail and Outlook.
  - After bypassing the https only error page navigating back would take you to the error page that was previously dismissed. Back now takes you to the previous site that was visited.
  - Paste unformatted shortcut (shift+ctrl/cmd+v) now works in plain text contexts, such as input and text area.
  - Various security fixes.
