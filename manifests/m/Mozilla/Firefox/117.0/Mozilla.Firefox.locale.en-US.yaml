ShortDescription: Mozilla Firefox is free and open source software, built by a community of thousands from all over the world.
Description: |-
  Firefox Browser, also known as Mozilla Firefox or simply Firefox, is a free and open-source web browser developed by the Mozilla Foundation and its subsidiary, the Mozilla Corporation.

  In 2017, Firefox began incorporating new technology under the code name Quantum to promote parallelism and a more intuitive user interface.
  Firefox is officially available for Windows 7 or newer, macOS, and Linux.
  Its unofficial ports are available for various Unix and Unix-like operating systems including FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, illumos, and Solaris Unix.

ReleaseNotes: |
  - Support for credit card autofill has been extended to users running Firefox in the IT, ES, AT, BE, and PL locales.
  - macOS users can now control the tabability of controls and links via about:preferences.

  - YouTube video lists now scroll correctly when navigating with a screen reader.
  - Various security fixes.

  - Web compatibility inspection has been enhanced with our new CSS compatibility tooltip in the Developer Tools Inspector.
