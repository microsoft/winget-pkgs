ShortDescription: Fast, easy to use digital audio compressor
Description: Monkeyâ€™s Audio is a fast and easy way to compress digital music.  Unlike traditional methods such as mp3, ogg, or wma that permanently discard quality to save space, Monkeyâ€™s Audio only makes perfect, bit-for-bit copies of your music.
