ReleaseNotes: |-
  - The page translations feature in the context menu now uses Bergamot to perform translations. This means that:
    - Translations appear much faster, and with higher quality.
    - The translation process now happens locally on your computer, so the contents of the page you're translating stay private.
  - Changed: pressing cmd/ctrl followed by a number n now moves to the nth tab, rather than moving n tabs left/right.
  - Fixed: pages might be sized incorrectly in some situations.
  - Fixed: parts of the UI might display in light mode even when dark mode is enabled.
  - Updated Dutch translations (@NaudtsRuben)
