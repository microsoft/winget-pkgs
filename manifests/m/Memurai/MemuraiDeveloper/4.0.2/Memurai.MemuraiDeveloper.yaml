Description: |
  It is designed to provide the reliability and performance demanded by enterprise Windows environments.
  Just like Redis, Memurai uses an in-memory data set to achieve great performance at scale, 
  and Memurai supports all the Redis features that you know and love, such as persistence, 
  replication, transactions, LUA scripting, high-availability, pub/sub, cluster, modules, streams, and LRU eviction. 
  In fact, it supports all of the Redis API 7.0 eviction policies.
ShortDescription: Memurai is a Redis-7.0-compatible cache and data store for Windows.
