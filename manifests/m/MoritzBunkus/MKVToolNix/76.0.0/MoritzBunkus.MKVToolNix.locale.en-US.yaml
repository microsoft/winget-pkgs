ReleaseNotes: |-
  Important notes
  - mkvmerge: removed the option --blockadd. Removing block additional data is not possible anymore, as it is often required for proper decoding. Part of the implementation of #3511.

  New features and enhancements
  - mkvmerge: JSON file identification: added a child element called num_index_entries to the properties track element containing the number of index entries found for a track. Currently only implemented for Matroska files where it contains the number of cue points. See #3510.
  - mkvmerge: the maximum block addition ID track header value is now calculated automatically from both the existing mappings & the actually used block additions in the block groups. Part of the implementation of #3511.
  - mkvmerge: Matroska reader: when reading WebM files that use block additions with ID 4 (HDR for VP9) an appropriate block addition mapping will be created automatically. Part of the implementation of #3511.
  - mkvmerge: MP4 reader: the title/movie name meta data (content of the udta.meta.ilst.©nam atom) will now be copied over as the segment title track header attribute. Part of the implementation of #3475.
  - mkvmerge: MP4 reader: the comment & encoder meta data (content of the udta.meta.ilst.©cmt & ….©too atoms) will now be copied over as global tags COMMENT & ENCODER respectively. Part of the implementation of #3475.
  - mkvmerge, MKVToolNix GUI's multiplexer: added an option to stop processing after the primary video track ends called --stop-after-video-ends. This discards any remaining packets of other tracks. Part of the implementation #3506.
  - MKVToolNix GUI: only on Windows: the GUI now uses Qt's "Fusion" style instead of the deprecated "Windows Vista" style. The advantage is that as of Qt 6.5 the "Fusion" style properly supports Windows 10's & 11's dark application mode. The Windows binaries are now built with said Qt version. Therefore the option to disable the dark mode has been removed. Fixes #3264 and likely others.
  - MKVToolNix GUI: multiplexer: automatically setting the destination file name: added an option in the preferences for using the first source file's directory name instead of its file name as the basis for the destination file name. Implements #3512.
  - MKVToolNix GUI: multiplexer: double-clicking on certain columns in the "tracks" view will now toggle them directly (columns "Default track" & "Forced track") or activate the corresponding control (columns "Language", "Name" & "Delay"). Double-clicks on other columns will do what they've done before, too: toggling the "Copy item" state. Implements #3513 & others.
  - MKVToolNix GUI: the dialog for editing language tags is now created only the first time the user wants to edit a language tag & cached afterwards instead of creating a new instance each time. This makes subsequent uses instant.

  Bug fixes
  - mkvmerge: mkvmerge will now only try to probe for VobSubs if the name of the file to identify ends in either .idx or .sub, preventing mis-identification of other file types if VobSubs with the same base name exist in the same directory. Fixes #3508.
  - mkvmerge: AC-3: mkvmerge will now skip certain types of garbage data (16 bytes starting with 0x01 0x10) that can occur before each sync frame, fixing the file not being identified as AC-3. Fixes #3484.
  - mkvmerge: Matroska reader: when reading files that use block additions with IDs other than 1 (e.g. 4 for HDR for VP9) the IDs will now be kept & written to the output file. Before no ID would be written, effectively using 1 as that's the default value for the corresponding element. Part of the implementation of #3511.
  - mkvmerge: mkvmerge will no longer write block addition mappings or the max block addition ID track header elements when creating a WebM file as those elements aren't supported there. Part of the implementation of #3511.
  - mkvpropedit: fixed replacing chapters & tags in files that don't contain tracks. Fixes #3498.
