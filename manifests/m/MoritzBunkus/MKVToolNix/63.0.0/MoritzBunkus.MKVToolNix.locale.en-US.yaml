  New features and enhancements
  - mkvmerge: AC-3 parser: E-AC-3 with BSID values > 10 and ≤ 15 are recognized now, too. Implements #3211.
  - mkvmerge: when using language codes for track selection (e.g. -a und,en) all tracks that do not have a language property (due to their container not providing one, e.g. AVIs) will be treated as if they did have one set to und ("undetermined") as that is the language the track will have in the Matroska file anyway. Before this change it wasn't possible to match such tracks via language codes.
  - MKVToolNix GUI: only on Windows: when compiled with Qt ≥ 5.14 and < 6 (which is the case for the officially provided binaries) fractional screen scaling will be enabled. This means that the GUI will be scaled appropriately if Windows is set to 125%, 150% or 175% instead of being too small or too large. Implements #3043.
  - MKVToolNix GUI: the spinner in the bottom right corner will now be hidden when no jobs are currently running. Implements #3225.
  - MKVToolNix GUI: header editor: a new column has been added to the tree view showing the status of the "track enabled" flag. The information is also shown on the track overview page on the right. Implements #3228.
  - MKVToolNix GUI: header editor: users can now reorder tracks by dragging & dropping. Implements #3227.

  Bug fixes
  - mkvmerge: AVI reader: fixed reading AVI files that contain vprp video properties header chunks; reading aborted too early. Fixes #3209.
