ReleaseNotes: |-
  New features and enhancements
  - mkvmerge: chapters: added support for specifying MPLS files with --chapters, too, not just as regular source files. The documentation stated this was possible already, but that wasn't actually the case. Implements/fixes #3735.
  - MKVToolNix GUI: multiplexer: added a progress dialog that is shown during file identification.
  - MKVToolNix GUI: jobs: the status bar now differentiates between numbers of warnings/errors that occurred in the current session and those that occurred before the current session. Implements #3732.

  Bug fixes
  - mkvmerge: AAC parser: LOAS/LATM streams: if the first AudioSpecificConfig element is not found within the first LOAS/LATM frame, mkvmerge will no longer discard the frames before it but defer parsing them until after it has found the AudioSpecificConfig element. Fixes #3727.
  - MKVToolNix GUI: job queue: fixed the GUI crashing when re-ordering the jobs in the job queue. This regression was introduced while fixing #3720. Fixes #3729.

  Build system changes
  - The bundled fmt library was updated to v10.2.1.
