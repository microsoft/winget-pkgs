  New features and enhancements
  - mkvmerge, MKVToolNix GUI's multiplexer: added support for the Emphasis audio track header element via the --audio-emphasis option. It is also read from Matroska files.
  - mkvmerge: the options --list-stereo-modes and --list-audio-emphasis have been added to list all support numerical & textual values for the --stereo-mode & --audio-emphasis options.
  - mkvpropedit, MKVToolNix GUI's header editor: added support for the Emphasis audio track header element via the emphasis property.
  - MKVToolNix GUI: multiplexer: when the track properties are configured to be displayed in a tab widget below the files & tracks in the "Input" tab, the "Color information" tab will be laid out in two columns. This reduces the minimum height the whole tab widget requires. Implements #3401.
  - MKVToolNix GUI: greatly sped up closing the preferences dialog by only re-running certain initialization functions when their corresponding settings have changed. Also fixes issues such as #3406.
  - mkvinfo, MKVToolNix GUI's info tool: added support for the following new elements from Matroska v5: Emphasis audio track header element; Chapter Skip Type; Edition Display; Edition String; Edition Language IETF.
  - mkvmerge, mkvpropedit: added support for the following new chapter elements from Matroska v5: Chapter Skip Type; Edition Display; Edition String; Edition Language IETF. The GUI's chapter editor will receive support for them in the next release.

  Bug fixes
  - mkvmerge: Ogg/OGM reader: mkvmerge will now correctly skip tracks of unsupported types as well as tracks for which all track header pages haven't been found. Fixes #3394.
