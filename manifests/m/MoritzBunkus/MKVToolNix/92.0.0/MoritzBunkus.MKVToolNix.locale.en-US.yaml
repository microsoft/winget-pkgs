ShortDescription: MKVToolNix is a set of tools to create, alter and inspect Matroska files under Linux, other Unices and Windows.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  New features and enhancements
  - mkvmerge: FLAC reader: pictures embedded into the FLAC file were already handled as attachments, but they were left in the codec initialization data as well. They're now removed from the codec initialization data. See #6079.
  - mkvmerge: FLAC reader: padding metadata blocks will now be removed from the codec initialization data. See #6079.
  - mkvmerge: FLAC reader: embedded Vorbis comments will now be converted into Matroska comments or track/global header fields when available (e.g. TITLE will become the segment title & track's name, LANGUAGE will become the track's language). Copying of Vorbis comments that are converted into actual Matroska tags can be prevented with the usual options, e.g. --no-track-tags. The comments will also be removed from the codec initialization data. Implements #6079.
  - mkvmerge, MKVToolNix GUI's chapter editor: when reading simple (OGM-style) chapter files & no character set is given for the file, mkvmerge will try UTF-8 first before falling back to the system's default encoding. Implements #6084.
  - MKVToolNix GUI: multiplexer: the special drag & drop zones added in v91 are now shown by default in new installations.
  - MKVToolNix GUI: in new installations the main window will now be sized at 75% of the screen's resolution initially with a certain minimum initial size. This improves initial readability on high DPI screens that use screen scaling factors such as 150%.

  Bug fixes
  - mkvmerge: Ogg reader: during identification the track tags are now reported properly.
  - MKVToolNix GUI: multiplexer: within the "additional options", both track-specific ones & the global ones on the "Output" tab, it wasn't possible to specify empty (zero-length) arguments. With the intended syntax of two consecutive single or double quotation marks the empty arguments were simply skipped. This was fixed, and it is now possible to specify e.g. --title "" in the global "Additional options" in order to force no title to be written ever. Fixes #6087.

  Build system changes
  - Windows build: the packaging/windows/populate_installer_dir.sh now expects the user to pass the Saxon-HE's JAR file name to be passed with the -s or --saxon-jar parameter instead of the base directory for Saxon-HE. This allows newer versions of Saxon-HE to be used.
