Description: |-
  Power BI Report Builder is a tool for authoring paginated reports that you can publish to the Power BI service.
  Paginated reports are designed to be printed or shared. They're formatted to fit well on a page, and they display
  all the data in a table, even if the table spans multiple pages. When you design a paginated report, you're creating
  a report definition that specifies what data to retrieve, where to get it, and how to display it. When you run the
  report, the report processor takes the report definition you have specified, retrieves the data, and combines it
  with the report layout to generate the report.
