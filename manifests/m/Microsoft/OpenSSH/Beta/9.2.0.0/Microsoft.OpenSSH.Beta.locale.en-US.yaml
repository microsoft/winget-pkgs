ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Upstream changes from OpenSSH 9.2, which fixes a number of security bugs.
  - Breaking changes - see upstream release notes for more information:
  - adds EnableEscapeCommandline to ssh_config, a new option, that controls whether the client-side C escape sequence that provides a command-line is available.
    EnableEscapeCommandline defaults to "no", which disables the C escape sequence that was previously enabled by default.
  - Security:
  - The sftp server will not attempt to add the Mark-of-the-Web (MOTW) for files uploaded from sftp clients, which reverts the behavior added in 9.1.
    This is on par with scp behavior for file uploads.
    File download behavior via scp and sftp remains the same as 9.1, with a best effort attempt to add the MOTW.
    This change was prompted by Community feedback, as discussed in #2029.
  - Fixes for #2018 and #2019.
