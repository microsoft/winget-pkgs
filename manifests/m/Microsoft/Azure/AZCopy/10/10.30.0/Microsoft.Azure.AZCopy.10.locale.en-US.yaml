ReleaseNotes: |-
  Version 10.30.0
  Breaking changes
  1. For transfers involving Azure Files (NFS or SMB), AzCopy will not auto create file shares.
  2. AzCopy binaries and latest version information will now be distributed from Github releases instead of the static website. (#3014)
  New Features
  1. Azure Files NFS Support via REST.
     Support for transferring data between local Linux systems and Azure Files NFS using REST. To use this feature, please explicitly specify the --from-to flag.
     - Transfer from local Linux to Azure Files NFS. (--from-to=LocalFileNFS)
     - Transfer from Azure Files NFS to local Linux. (--from-to=FileNFSLocal)
     - Transfer between Azure Files NFS shares from. (--from-to=FileNFSFileNFS)
       Note:
       - Azure Files NFS to Azure Files NFS transfers (FileNFSFileNFS) are supported on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
       - Transfers from local to NFS (LocalFileNFS) and NFS to local (FileNFSLocal) are supported only on Linux systems.
  2. Added support to retry on copy source error code and status code for service to service copies. (#3105)
  3. Added support for service to service copies from Azure Files to Blob Storage using EntraID. (#3053)
  Bug Fixes
  1. Fixed a bug where when copying a file that has already been deleted with --trailing-dot=Disable resulted in the wrong error instead of a 404. (#3092)
  Supportability
  1. Removed the warning message when failing to create a container. This message can be misleading when there is insufficient permissions to create a container and the container already exists. (#3045)
  2. Improved the error message returned when block size is larger than bandwidth limit. (#3051)
  3. Warn user if transfer is going to exceed 10M objects. (#3111)
  4. Warn user if multiple AzCopy processes are running. (#3128)
