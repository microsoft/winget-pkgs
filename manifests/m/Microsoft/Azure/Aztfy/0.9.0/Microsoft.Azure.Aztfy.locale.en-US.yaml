ShortDescription: A tool to bring your existing Azure resources under the management of Terraform.
Description: |-
  Azure Terrafy imports the resources that are supported by the Terraform AzureRM provider into the Terraform state, and generates the corresponding Terraform configuration.
  Both the Terraform state and configuration are expected to be consistent with the resources' remote state, i.e., terraform plan shows no diff.
  The user then is able to use Terraform to manage these resources.

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    Importing resources in parallel - rather than in serial. The default parallelism is set to 10. Users can change it via the option --parallelism (#260)
    Supports Terraform AzureRM provider v3.31.0 (#302)

  BUG FIXES:

    Handle multiple azure resources having the same Terraform IDs when resolving Terraform dependencies by adding a comment containing all the candidates and let users to choose (#251)
    Fix panic in azlist (#262)
    Avoid using os.Rename() to move files as it doesn't work for Windows when moving files across drives (#269)
    In resource mode, handle Terraform address conflicts on multiple same typed prop-like resources (previously we incorrectly assume there will be only one such resource) (#281)
    Fix some incorrect import specs in aztft (#294, #299, #300)
