ReleaseNotes: |-
  October 2025 (Version 1.40.1, build 20251026.4)
  Welcome to Storage Explorer version 1.40.1. This release updates the bundled version of .NET to 8.0.21.
  Version 1.40.1 includes features and bug fixes from 1.40.0. For a detailed list of all issues closed, visit our Issues page.
  Downloading from NFS File Shares
  In Storage Explorer version 1.40.0, we introduced support for uploading and downloading files from NFS file shares on Linux systems. Some users may have encountered issues when downloading files from NFS file shares. The files are downloaded, but the operation appears to fail in Storage Explorer.
  AzCopy will not download anything from an NFS file share unless the --preserve-permissions option is provided. This option instructs AzCopy to preserve the original file's ownership on the local machine. However, this requires running AzCopy with sudo, because AzCopy needs to change file ownership, which requires elevated privileges. Storage Explorer cannot invoke AzCopy with sudo. This leads to the issue where downloads appear to fail regardless of settings.
  If you encounter this issue, you can work around it using two methods:
  - Copy the AzCopy command and execute it directly from the command line with sudo.
  - Disable the Transfers → Preserve Permissions setting when uploading files (remove the --preserve-permissions option from AzCopy). Enable the Transfers → Preserve Permissions setting when downloading files (add the --preserve-permissions option to AzCopy).
  This issue will be addressed in a future version of Storage Explorer.
  Electron 38
  Storage Explorer now uses Electron 38. You can learn more from the Electron blog.
