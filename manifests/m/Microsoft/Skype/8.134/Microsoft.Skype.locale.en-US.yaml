Description: |-
  Skype is for connecting with the people that matter most in your life and work. It's built for both one-on-one and group conversations and works wherever you are – via mobile, PC and Alexa. Skype messaging and HD voice and video calling will help you share experiences and get things done with others.
  With Skype, you can have meetings and create great things with your workgroup, share a story or celebrate a birthday with friends and family, and learn a new skill or hobby with a teacher. It’s free to use Skype – to send messages and have audio and video calls with groups of up to 100 people!
  If you pay a little, you can do more things, in more ways, with more people – like call phones or SMS messages. You can pay as you go or buy a subscription, whatever works for you.
  Try Skype out today and start adding your friends, family and colleagues. They won’t be hard to find; hundreds of millions of people are already using Skype to do all sorts of things together.
