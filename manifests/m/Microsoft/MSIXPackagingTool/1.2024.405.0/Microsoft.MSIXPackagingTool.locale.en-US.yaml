InstallationNotes: |-
  MSIX Packaging Tool relies on the «MSIX Packaging Tool Driver» that is available in Windows Settings → System → Optional Features. Since it is in Windows Settings and not in Control Panel's optional features, it cannot be added to the Winget package as an automatic dependency.

  Users must thus enable the feature themselves. Alternately, the program can also try to enable it by itself when reaching «Prepare computer» in the setup, but can take 2 tries to do so.
