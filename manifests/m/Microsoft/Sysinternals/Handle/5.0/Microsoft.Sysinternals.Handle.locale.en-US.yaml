ShortDescription: Handle is a utility that displays information about open handles for any process in the system.
Description: |-
  Handle is a utility that displays information about open handles for any process in the system. You can use it to see the programs that have a file open, or to see the object types and names of all the handles of a program.

  Handle is targeted at searching for open file references, so if you do not specify any command-line parameters it will list the values of all the handles in the system that refer to open files and the names of the files. It also takes several parameters that modify this behavior.

  When in search mode, Handle prints the process names and id's are listed on the left side and the names of the objects that had a match are on the right.
