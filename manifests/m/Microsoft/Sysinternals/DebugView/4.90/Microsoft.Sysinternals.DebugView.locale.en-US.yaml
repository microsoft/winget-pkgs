Description: >
  DebugView is an application that lets you monitor debug output on your local
  system, or any computer on the network that you can reach via TCP/IP. It is
  capable of displaying both kernel-mode and Win32 debug output, so you don't
  need a debugger to catch the debug output your applications or device drivers
  generate, nor do you need to modify your applications or drivers to use
  non-standard debug output APIs.
