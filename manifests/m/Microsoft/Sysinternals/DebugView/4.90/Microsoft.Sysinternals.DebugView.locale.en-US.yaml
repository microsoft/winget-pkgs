ShortDescription: DebugView is an application that lets you monitor debug output on your local system, or any computer on the network that you can reach via TCP/IP.
Description: |-
  DebugView is an application that lets you monitor debug output on your local system, or any computer on the network that you can reach via TCP/IP. It is capable of displaying both kernel-mode and Win32 debug output, so you don't need a debugger to catch the debug output your applications or device drivers generate, nor do you need to modify your applications or drivers to use non-standard debug output APIs.

  Under Windows 2000, XP, Server 2003 and Vista DebugView will capture:
  - Win32 OutputDebugString
  - Kernel-mode DbgPrint
  - All kernel-mode variants of DbgPrint implemented in Windows XP and Server 2003
  
  DebugView also extracts kernel-mode debug output generated before a crash from Window's 2000/XP crash dump files if DebugView was capturing at the time of the crash.

  Here is a list highlighting some of DebugView's other features:
  - Remote monitoring: Capture kernel-mode and/or Win32 debug output from any computer accessible via TCP/IP - even across the Internet. You can monitor multiple remote computers simultaneously. DebugView will even install its client software itself if you are running it on a Windows 2000 system and are capturing from another Windows 2000 system in the same Network Neighborhood.
  - Most-recent-filter lists:DebugView remembers your most recent filter selections, with an interface that makes it easy to reselect them.
  - Process ID option: Toggle the display of process IDs for Win32 debug output.
  - Clipboard copy: Select multiple lines in the output window and copy their contents to the clipboard.
  - Log-to-file: Write debug output to a file as its being captured.
  - Printing: Print all or part of captured debug output to a printer.
  - One-file payload:DebugView is implemented as one file.
  - Crash-Dump Support:DebugView can recover its buffers from a crash dump and save the output to a log file so that users can send you the output your Windows driver generated right up to the time of a crash.
