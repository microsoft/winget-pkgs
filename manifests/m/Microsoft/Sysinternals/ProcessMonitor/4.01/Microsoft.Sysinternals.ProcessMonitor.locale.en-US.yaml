Description: |-
  Process Monitor is an advanced monitoring tool for Windows that shows real-time file system, Registry and process/thread activity. It combines the features of two legacy Sysinternals utilities, Filemon and Regmon, and adds an extensive list of enhancements including rich and non-destructive filtering, comprehensive event properties such as session IDs and user names, reliable process information, full thread stacks with integrated symbol support for each operation, simultaneous logging to a file, and much more. Its uniquely powerful features will make Process Monitor a core utility in your system troubleshooting and malware hunting toolkit.

  Process Monitor includes powerful monitoring and filtering capabilities, including:
  - More data captured for operation input and output parameters
  - Non-destructive filters allow you to set filters without losing data
  - Capture of thread stacks for each operation make it possible in many cases to identify the root cause of an operation
  - Reliable capture of process details, including image path, command line, user and session ID
  - Configurable and moveable columns for any event property
  - Filters can be set for any data field, including fields not configured as columns
  - Advanced logging architecture scales to tens of millions of captured events and gigabytes of log data
  - Process tree tool shows relationship of all processes referenced in a trace
  - Native log format preserves all data for loading in a different Process Monitor instance
  - Process tooltip for easy viewing of process image information
  - Detail tooltip allows convenient access to formatted data that doesn't fit in the column
  - Cancellable search
  - Boot time logging of all operations
