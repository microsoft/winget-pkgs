ShortDescription: Facilitate transfer of data between Microsoft Office System files and non-Microsoft Office applications.
Description: |-
  Microsoft Access database engine 2016 is a set of components that facilitate the transfer of data between existing Microsoft Office files such as Microsoft Office Access (*.mdb and *.accdb) files and Microsoft Office Excel (*.xls, *.xlsx, and *.xlsb) files to other data sources such as Microsoft SQL Server. Connectivity to existing text files is also supported.

  The Access Database Engine 2016 Redistributable is not intended:
  1. As a general replacement for Jet (If you need a general replacement for Jet you should use SQL Server Express Edition).
  2. As a replacement for the Jet OLEDB Provider in server-side applications.
  3. As a general word processing, spreadsheet or database management system -To be used as a way to create files. (You can use Microsoft Office or Office automation to create the files that Microsoft Office supports.)
  4. To be used by a system service or server-side program where the code will run under a system account, or will deal with multiple users identities concurrently, or is highly reentrant and expects stateless behavior. Examples would include a program that is run from task scheduler when no user is logged in, or a program called from server-side web application such as ASP.NET, or a distributed component running under COM+ services.
