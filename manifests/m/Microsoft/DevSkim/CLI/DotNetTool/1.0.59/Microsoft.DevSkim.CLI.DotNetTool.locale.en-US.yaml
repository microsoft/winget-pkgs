Description: |-
  A framework of IDE extensions and language analyzers that provide inline security analysis in the dev environment as the developer writes code. It has a flexible rule model that supports multiple programming languages. The goal is to notify the developer as they are introducing a security vulnerability in order to fix the issue at the point of introduction, and to help build awareness for the developer.
