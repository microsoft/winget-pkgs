ReleaseNotes: |-
  Highlights:
  - Paste as BicepParams (#15897)
  - Add resourceInput<> and resourceOutput<> utility types (#15825)
    We've added two new utility types (resourceInput<> and resourceOutput<>), which deprecates the existing resource<> utility types. These three utility types are all closely related but differ in which property flags they surface:
    - resource<> has the flags that were originally defined in the RP types artifact. This is generally not what people want.
    - resourceInput<> strips out all WriteOnly flags. This means that template authors can access properties on a resourceInput<>-typed parameter that would have previously raised a BCP077 diagnostic.
    - resourceOutput<> strips out all ReadOnly flags.
  - Expose fail function (#15958) This function takes a single string argument, whose value is the message of the error that will be raised.
