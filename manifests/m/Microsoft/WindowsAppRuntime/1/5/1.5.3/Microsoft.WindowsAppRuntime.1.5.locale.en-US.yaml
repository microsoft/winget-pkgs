  This is a servicing release of the Windows App SDK that includes critical bug fixes for the 1.5 release.
  - Fixed an issue where ItemsRepeater sometimes caused its window to be brought to the front.
  - Fixed a potential crash when the transparency state of an AcrylicBrush was updated.
  - Fixed an issue where ItemsRepeater would not generate enough items if it was in a ShouldConstrainToRootBounds="false" popup that was taller or wider than the main window.
