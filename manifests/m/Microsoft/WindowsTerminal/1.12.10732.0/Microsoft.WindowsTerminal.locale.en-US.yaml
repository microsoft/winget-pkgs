  Changes
  This version of Windows Terminal is now distributed in two bundles, one of which works on Windows 10-11 and the
  other of which only works on Windows 11. The Windows 11 version is much smaller because we no longer need to work around
  a platform issue related to our dependencies.

  If you intend on using Terminal as an unpackaged application--that is, extracting the msix file--we recommend that
  you use the Win10 bundle. You will need the Visual C++ runtime redistributable.

  In addition, if you install the packaged version on either Windows 10 or Windows 11, it now depends on the Visual C++ Universal Runtime Package.

  Despite these distributions having different version numbers, they are built from the same code and there is no
  functional difference between them.

  If you install the Windows 10 verison on Windows 11, it will probably automatically upgrade itself to the Windows 11
  version. It turns out that it is impossible to have two bundles with the same version number, so it has to be this
  way.

  Bug Fixes
  - Usability
  • Terminal can once again be configured as a startup application, and can be detected by tools like PowerToys (#12491)
  • There was a puzzling "Element not found" error during settings loading; there is no longer such an error (#12687)
  • Terminal will no longer mix up profiles when it is launched in response to a console application spawning (#12484)
  • Formatted copy will now try harder to preserve Unicode charatcers in RTF (#12586) (thanks @ianjoneill!)
  • We have replaced the word "Summon" with "Show/Hide" in the command palette for improved localization (#12603)
  • Our confidence in the settings UI's Save button has led to us no longer backing up the settings JSON file (#12652)
    • We won't be deleting the 61,000 backups we did leave on your hard drive, but what's a couple thousand kilobytes between friends?

  - Accessibility
  • Terminal now announces newly-printed text to any attached screen reader (#12358)
  • Command palette search now tries to announce the number of results to the screen reader (#12429)

  - Reliability
  • We won't crash any longer if you give us a command line that is a directory (#12538) (thanks @ianjoneill!)
  • A crash on launch related to multi-windowing and the default terminal setting has been quashed (subset of #12205)
  • Fixed a crash setting the hotkey during teardown (#12580)
  • Fixed a different pair of crashes, also likely related to default terminal handoff (#12666)
  • ScrollConsoleScreenBuffer no longer takes the console upstate (#12669)
  • Pressing Page Up or Page Down with an empty command palette, which seemed like a reasonable thing to do, was taught to not crash the Terminal (#12528)

  - Rendering
  • Font axes/features once again work across a DPI change (#12492)
