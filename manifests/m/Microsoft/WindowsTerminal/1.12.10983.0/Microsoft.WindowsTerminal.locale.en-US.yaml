ReleaseNotes: |-
  Changes
  • The refreshed Windows 11 UI from the 1.13 preview builds is now available in 1.12!

  Bug Fixes
  Appearance
  • Our Maximize/Restore button is now a fine round boi

  Accessibility
  • The profile list in the Settings UI now offers tooltips for long profile names
  • We'll automatically focus the window renamer textbox when it opens
  • High contrast will no longer result in a ridiculous and bad titlebar color
  • When you delete a color scheme, we'll move focus back to the color scheme list
  • When you delete a profile, we will re-focus the delete button automatically
  • Two instances of huge debug log spam with a screen reader connected have been stamped out

  Usability
  • We've added some text to the color schemes page indicating that it is for editing--not setting--color schemes
    • We're working to refine how color schemes are set and edited, so stay tuned for future improvements!
  • The retro terminal effect (as well as other shaders) will now work on pre-D3D11 hardware!
  • Terminal will once again render properly when you move between different-DPI displays
  • Resizing the window while a background color or underline is displayed will no longer smear it across the whole screen plus a fix for a huge crash that PR introduced
  • It took us three releases to get it right, but we've finally solved the issue where we'd punch a hole straight through the Terminal when a dialog appeared

  Reliability
  • Typing an invalid background image path into the Settings UI will no longer send Terminal to a farm upstate
  • There was an issue on Windows 11 where Terminal would queue up billions of animations while the screen was off; it will now no longer do so
  • We've fixed crashes in ProposeCommandline, Monarch::_GetPID and other parts of WT's RPC infrastructure
  • On Windows 10, the settings UI will no longer sometimes crash on close (we've updated to a new build of WinUI 2 for the fix!)

  Miscellaneous
  • Windows will no longer reject certain Terminal updates/reinstalls due to "differing package content"
  • Fragments can once again override the names of generated profiles
  • An issue from the 1073 series, where you could not upgrade the bundle using DISM, has been resolved
    • As a result, our bundle version is now over three thousand!
  • @dmezh contributed some wording changes to the text about transparency/opacity
