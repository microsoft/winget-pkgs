ShortDescription: XML Notepad provides a simple intuitive User Interface for browsing and editing XML documents.
Description: XML Notepad is the result of a promise Chris Lovett made to a friend at Microsoft. The original XML Notepad shipped in back in 1998, written by Murray Low in C++. Later on it fell behind in support for XML standards and, because we didn't have time to fix it, we pulled the downloader. But Murray apparently did such a nice job that MSDN was inundated with requests to put the notepad back up, so they asked for a replacement.
