ShortDescription: CPU profiling trace viewer
Description: >
  Profile Explorer is a tool for viewing CPU profiling traces collected through the Event Tracing
  for Windows (ETW) infrastructure on machines with x64 and ARM64 CPUs. Its focus is on presenting
  the slowest parts of the profiled application through an easy-to-use but detailed UI consisting of
  several views, such as a hot function list, flame graph, call tree, timeline, assembly code view,
  and source file view.
