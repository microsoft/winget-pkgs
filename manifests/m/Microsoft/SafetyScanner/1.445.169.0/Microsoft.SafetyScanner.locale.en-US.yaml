Description: |-
  A scan tool designed to find and remove malware from Windows computers. Download it and run a scan to find malware and try to reverse changes made by identified threats.

  The tool uses the same security intelligence update definitions as (among others) Microsoft Defender Antivirus. Safety Scanner does however not have an internal definition update checker, but does get app updates every 3-4 hours. Thus, the Winget package may lag some days behind Windows Update + Microsoft Defender Antivirus.
