ShortDescription: 'Windows UI Library: the latest Windows 10 native controls and Fluent styles for your applications'
Description: |-
  WinUI 2 is a library of controls that provides Microsoft UI controls and features for UWP apps.
  WinUI 2 is tightly integrated with Windows SDKs and provides official native Windows UI controls and other user interface elements for UWP applications (and desktop applications using XAML Islands).

  Maintaining down-level compatibility with earlier versions of Windows 10 enables WinUI 2 controls to work even if users don't have the latest OS.

  Features
  - New controls: WinUI contains new controls that aren't shipped as part of the default Windows platform.
  - Updated versions of existing controls: The library also contains updated versions of existing Windows platform controls that you can use with earlier versions of Windows 10.
  - Support for earlier versions of Windows 10: WinUI APIs work on earlier versions of Windows 10, so you don't have to include version checks or conditional XAML to support users who might not be running the very latest OS.
  - Support for XamlDirect: The Xaml Direct APIs, designed for middleware developers, give you access to lower-level XAML features that provide better CPU and working set performance. XamlDirect in WinUI 2 lets you use XamlDirect APIs on earlier versions of Windows 10 without needing to write special code to handle multiple target Windows 10 versions.
