    - NuGet Restore restoring old versions of transitive dependencies when direct dependency does not have guidelines for user's targeted .NET Framework - #13934
    - Project and package in the same graph with the same name but different dependencies may lead to incorrect versions of the dependencies of that id - #13888
  - Package Manager UI in Visual Studio now shows embedded READMEs for NuGet packages, if available - #12583
