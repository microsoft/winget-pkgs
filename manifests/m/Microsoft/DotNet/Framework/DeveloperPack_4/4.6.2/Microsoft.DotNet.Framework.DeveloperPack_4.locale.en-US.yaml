ShortDescription: .NET Framework is a technology that supports building and running Windows apps and web services
Description: |-
  This is an offline installer. There are separate installers for web and offline installation.
  If you intend to redistribute either of these installers in the setup for your own product or application,
  we recommend that you choose the web installer because it is smaller and typically downloads faster. You
  can download the web installer here. Wherever possible, Microsoft recommends you use the Web Installer in
  lieu of the Offline Package for optimal efficiency and bandwidth requirements. The offline package can be
  used in situations where the web installer cannot be used due to lack of internet connectivity. This
  package is larger than the web installer and does not include the language packs. You can download and
  install the language packs from here.
