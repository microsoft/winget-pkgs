# Agreements:
ReleaseNotes: |-
  Roll-up through 2023/02/24.

  - Add a new collection option /UserCritContention and analysis view for analyzing work done while the UserCrit is held.
    This is interesting for UI apps that experience visual perturbances.
  - Improvements to how TraceEvent and PerfView handle clean-up of ETW session handles.
  - Movement of utility classes to the Microsoft.Diagnostics.Utilities namespace to avoid namespace collisions.
  - Switch PerfView and TraceEvent to only use documented Win32 APIs. Remove OSExtensions.dll from
    PerfView and TraceEvent packaging.
  - Remove InternalOnly checks in PerfView which limited features to users on Microsoftâ€™s corporate network.
