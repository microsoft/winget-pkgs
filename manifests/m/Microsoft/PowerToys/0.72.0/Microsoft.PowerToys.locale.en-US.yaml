ReleaseNotes: |-
  Highlights
  - Greatly reduced the PowerToys installed space by having utilities share the same installed path.
    When compared to 0.71, the 0.72 x64 machine installed version of PowerToys reduces the size reported in the Installed Apps screen from 1.15GB to 785 MB and the size in File Explorer properties for the installation folder from 3.10GB to 554 MB.
  - Value Generator - A new PowerToys Run plugin that generates hashes and GUID values.
    Thanks @IHorvalds!
  - Mouse Highlighter has a new feature to have a highlight always follow the mouse pointer.
    Thanks @hayatogh!
  - PowerRename was reworked to support a bigger number of files without crashing.
  Known issues
  - Due to changing paths in the installation folder, the Mouse Without Borders service might be pointing to the wrong place.
    Users not running as admin will have to enable service mode again after install.
    A toast notification will appear if Mouse Without Borders is unable to start the service correctly.
  - File Explorer extensions changed paths might not be loaded correctly until File Explorer and Preview Host processes are restarted, so we advise restarting the computer when possible after updating PowerToys.

  - Added missing icons and icon sizes.
    Thanks @niels9001!
  FancyZones

  Mouse Highlighter
  - Added a feature so that a highlight follows the mouse even if no mouse button is being pressed.
    Thanks @hayatogh!
  Mouse Pointer Crosshairs
  - Added a setting to hide the crosshairs when the mouse pointer is also hidden.
    Thanks @davidegiacometti!
  - Added a setting to select a fixed length for the crosshairs, which also spans across screens.
    Thanks @Epp-code!
  Mouse Without Borders
  - Switched to a UWP mouse input API to fix mouse pointer lag issues that were reported.
  - A toast notification will appear when the service can't be started and Mouse Without Borders will try to start in non-service mode instead.
  - Fixed a bug where the service path wouldn't update to the new binary path when trying to re-enable service mode.
  - Fixed some grammar errors in the Mouse Without Borders user facing strings.
    Thanks @KhurramJalil!
  - Allow changing the shortcuts in the same way as other utilities and changed them to better defaults to avoid conflicting with Alt Gr+letter combos on international layouts.
  Peek
  - Also benefits from the Monaco dependency update when peeking into files supported by the Developer Files Preview.
    Thanks @Aaron-Junker!
