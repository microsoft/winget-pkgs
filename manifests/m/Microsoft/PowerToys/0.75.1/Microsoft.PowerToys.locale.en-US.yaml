  Highlights
  - #29491 - The generalization of a fix for snapping popup windows was causing many applications to not be snappable by FancyZones.
    We're reverted that change for this patch and we'll investigate a better fix for a future release.
  - #29465 - We've recently included more ways for PowerToys Run plugin developers to include different data types as additional options for their plugins, but these were not being initialized correctly.
    Now they should be working.
    Thanks @waaverecords!
