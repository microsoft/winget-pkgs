InstallationNotes: |-
  GDK Visual Studio extensions require configuring the target Visual Studio instance with the Game development with C++ workload before installing the GDK. 
  If this workload is configured **after** installing the GDK, **you must repair** the GDK via the Windows Programs and Features control panel. Using https://aka.ms/winget-configuration with the https://aka.ms/gdkInstallYaml file will ensure that the optimal install order is followed.
