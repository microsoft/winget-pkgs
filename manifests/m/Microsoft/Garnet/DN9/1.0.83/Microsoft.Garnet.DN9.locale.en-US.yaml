ShortDescription: >
  Garnet is a remote cache-store from Microsoft Research that offers strong
  performance (throughput and latency), scalability, storage, recovery, cluster
  sharding, key migration, and replication features. Garnet can work with
  existing Redis clients.
Description: |-
  Garnet is a new remote cache-store from Microsoft Research, that
  offers several unique benefits:

  - Garnet adopts the popular RESP wire protocol as a starting point, which makes
    it possible to use Garnet from unmodified Redis clients available in most
    programming languages of today, such as StackExchange.Redis in C#.
  - Garnet offers much better throughput and scalability with many client
    connections and small batches, relative to comparable open-source
    cache-stores, leading to cost savings for large apps and services.
  - Garnet demonstrates extremely low client latencies (often less than 300
    microseconds at the 99.9th percentile) using commodity cloud (Azure) VMs with
    Accelerated Networking enabled, which is critical to real-world scenarios.
  - Based on the latest .NET technology, Garnet is cross-platform, extensible, and
    modern. It is designed to be easy to develop for and evolve, without
    sacrificing performance in the common case. We leveraged the rich library
    ecosystem of .NET for API breadth, with open opportunities for optimization.
    Thanks to our careful use of .NET, Garnet achieves state-of-the-art
    performance on both Linux and Windows.
