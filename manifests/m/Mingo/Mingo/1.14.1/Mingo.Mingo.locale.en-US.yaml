Moniker: mingo
ReleaseNotes: |-
  Mingo is back with a new release packed with 42 improvements, fixes and goodies.
  1.  Blank Tab - Show last used collections from each connection (in project) by colour in columns, last 10, for example
  2.  Side menu Finder button / link added
  3.  Documents - on deep objects, “expand recursively” would be great
  4.  Documents - Add column - add filter in context menu
  5.  Documents - Truncate collection - same confirm modal as for Drop collection
  6.  Documents - “Load entire documents” (in case of projection set) should go to default saved query for collection
  7.  Documents - Added “home” icon to go to saved default query. X clears the filter completely now.
  8.  Documents - expand all fields does not work properly on documents (rename to “Expand recursively”)
  9.  Documents - List does not update after inserting a new document
  10. Documents - Editing documents should understand any of the following: Date(), ISODate() even without “new”
  11. Documents - CMD+click (or CTRL+click) on field value filters the documents by that field / value.
  12. Collections List - Duplicate Collection can be done faster if the copy is in the same database as the original using aggregation stage $out
  13. Collections List - Dropping multiple collections does not work
  14. Collections List - Dropping multiple confirm box shows wrong collection names
  15. Collections List - Sizes in bytes are weird
  16. Custom Actions - All collections are now accessible in the custom actions
  17. Data Relations - Ability to exclude collections from data relations completely
  18. NodeShell - When contains aggregation $out stage, does not ask for confirmation, as it is a write operation
  19. Schema Analyzer - Show sample values - shows incorrect values in case of deeply nested arrays
  20. Schema Analyzer - Expand button should have a hover effect
  21. Schema Analyzer - Projection should be shown by default
  22. Workspace selector (sidebar) - Deprecation of “open in new window”
  23. Workspace selector (sidebar) - Icon shows image if available in list
  24. Manage connections - Remove “open connection” button - useless
  25. Manage connections - Drag-and-drop sorting
  26. Finder (Blank tab) - shows recent collections when used in a project (not regular connection)
  27. #639: Document preview issue
  28. #637: Expanding a sample result document in an aggregation is unpleasant when a field is large
  29. #636: "Analyzing data relations" covers up import button
  30. #632: Typo of "Explain Filter"
  31. #630: Showing a dummy date instead of real value!
  32. #629: Incorrect binary data representation
  33. #626: Custom actions doesn't work
  34. #624: Aggregation pipeline with date comparison using extended JSON does not work
  35. #621: [FR] Show execution time in minutes instead of seconds
  36. #620: Mingo asks for password to my database each time I restart
  37. #618: Not possible to create new relations
  38. #612: Invalid Selector: TypeError: Class constructor ObjectId cannot be invoked without 'new'
  39. #572: [FR] Convert timestamp to readable format
  40. #645: [FR] prevent firing empty aggregation when "Aggregator" tab is clicked
  41. #644: [FR] Ability to sort indexes by size, number of uses and name
  42. #646: [FR] Fuzzy search for collection names in new tab
