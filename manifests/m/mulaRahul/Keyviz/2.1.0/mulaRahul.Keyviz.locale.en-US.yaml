  🚀 What’s New?
  - Mouse Indicators: Now show clicks and scrolls alongside your cursor.
  - Custom Filters: Per-key control over what is visualized.
  - Press Count: A new bubble-style counter to track your keypresses.
  ✨ Big Changes
  - Rebuilt with Rust 🦀: I started from scratch! The app is now faster, more stable, and acts like a native desktop app.
  - Tiny Footprint: Shrunk the app size down to just ~4MB.
  - Style Backups: You can now export and backup your Kecap styles as .json files.
  - Windows Verified: No more security warnings—the Windows app is now officially code-signed.
  Special thanks to our early testers in the Discord community and the contributors in #272 for inspiring the new Mouse Indicator feature.
