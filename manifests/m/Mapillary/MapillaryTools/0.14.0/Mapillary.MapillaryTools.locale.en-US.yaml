ReleaseNotes: |-
  üåü Highlights
  - üöÄ Performance Boosts:
    Enjoy massive speed improvements across the board, including faster native EXIF, GoPro, CAMM, and Blackvue video processing. Uploads and processing are now significantly more responsive, making large dataset handling smoother than ever.
  - üõ†Ô∏è Built-in ExifTool Fallback:
    Mapillary Tools now uses its optimized native parsers for EXIF, CAMM, GoPro, and related metadata by default. If native parsing fails, it seamlessly falls back to using the ExifTool installed on your system, ensuring robust and reliable metadata extraction for all your files.
  - üì§ File-by-File Upload:
    Images are now uploaded individually, eliminating the need to create zip archives before uploading. This approach greatly reduces intermediate disk usage, speeds up the upload process, and enhances reliability‚Äîespecially with large or interrupted uploads.
  üöÄ Features
  - Improved Authentication: Enhanced authentication flow for a smoother user experience. (#733)
  - Image Upload Flexibility: Added support for uploading images file by file. (#753)
  - More Upload Options: Introduced additional upload options for debugging/development purpose. (#764)
  - Export as GPX: Now you can export descriptions as GPX files for visualization (just name your desc file as .gpx, i.e. --desc_path=foo.gpx). (#759)
  üõ†Ô∏è Improvements
  - Performance Boosts: Major speed-ups in native EXIF, GoPro, CAMM, and Blackvue video processing. (#721, #722, #729, #731)
  - Remove md5sum from Processing: Removed unnecessary md5sum calculation to speed up processing. (#725)
  - Better Upload Progress: Enhanced upload progress tracking and error handling. (#760, #736)
  - Geotagging Workflow: Improved geotagging process, including fallback with exiftool and better EXIF extraction. (#737, #728, #743)
  - Improved Logging: Logging is now more informative and easier to read. (#769)
  - EXIFTool Speed: Runs exiftool with the -fast parameter for quicker metadata extraction. (#745)
  - Timezone-aware gpxpy: Upgraded gpxpy to handle timezones correctly. (#768)
  - Upload Timeouts: Added configurable upload timeouts to prevent hanging uploads. (#767)
  - Upload Handle Caching: Upload handles are now cached to avoid offset reset issue (upload from beginning) and improved efficiency. (#766)
  üêõ Bug Fixes
  - EXIF Extraction: Fixed issues with EXIF data extraction and MAPFilename restoration. (#728, #739)
  - Upload Consistency: Ensured session keys are unique and the same sequence generates the same zip file. (#752, #738)
  - GoPro & Blackvue Compatibility: Improved camera detection and parsing for GoPro and Blackvue 900x. (#740, #756)
  - Source Options & Sequence Splitting: Fixed issues with source option handling and sequence splitting. (#754, #763)
  - Progress Bar: Fixed duplicate initialization of the progress bar. (#765)
  - Sample Video Quality: Addressed issues affecting sample video quality. (#761)
  - Duplication Check: Improved duplicate detection when compass angles are missing. (#718)
  - NMEA Parsing: Enhanced support for NMEA GGA/GLL/RMC sentences in Blackvue videos. (#757)
  üë∑ CI
  - PyInstaller Builds: Create builds in a folder using PyInstaller onedir. (#742)
  - Packaging with Python3.13: Upgrade from Python 3.11 to Python 3.13. (78fd6a49db)
  - Build System Updates: Switched to pyproject.toml for build configuration. (#755)
  ‚ôªÔ∏è Refactoring & Chores
  - Uploader Refactors: Major refactoring in uploader-related modules and CAMM/MP4 builder for maintainability. (#734, #735, #758)
  - Visitor Pattern for CAMM: Refactored CAMM parsing using the visitor pattern. (#723)
  - Geotagging Clean-up: Moved and simplified geotagging logic for clarity. (#726, #727)
  - Upload Zips Refactor: Improved logic for uploading zipped files. (#732)
  - Test Improvements: Added and fixed tests, including CLI and sequence processing tests. (#720, #730)
  - GoPro gpmf Module: Consolidated all GoPro related code in the gpmf module. (#724)
  - Types Upgrade: Upgraded types for better code reliability. (#741)
  - General Refactors: Various improvements and simplifications in ffmpeg usage and upload service. (#762, #758)
  - Uploader Enhancements: Refined uploader modules for reliability and maintainability. (#734, #735, #758)
