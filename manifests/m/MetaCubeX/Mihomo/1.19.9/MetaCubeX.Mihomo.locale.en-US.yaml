  What's Changed
  - 188372cb feat: add tls.ech-key for external-controller-tls by @wwqgtxx
  - 5cf0f18c feat: reality add support-x25519mlkem768, it only works with new version server by @wwqgtxx
  - a1350d49 feat: add ech-key for listeners by @wwqgtxx
  - c6d7ef8c feat: add ech-opts for anytls/shadowsocks/trojan/vmess/vless outbound by @wwqgtxx
  - dc958e6a feat: add ech-opts for hysteria/hysteria2/tuic outbound by @wwqgtxx
  - Other incompatible updates are the same as v1.19.6~v1.19.8:
  - For security reasons, all paths appearing in the configuration file will be limited to workdir (regardless of whether they are relative or absolute). If there is a specific need, please specify additional safe paths by setting the SAFE_PATHS environment variable while ensuring safety. The syntax of this environment variable is the same as the PATH environment variable parsing rules of this operating system (i.e., semicolon-separated under Windows and colon-separated under other systems)
  - For security reasons, the "path" parameter of /configs in the restful api has been restricted, and its directory also needs to be in workdir or SAFE_PATHS.
  - In addition, support for specifying routing-mark and interface-name for proxy-groups has been removed. Please specify the relevant parameters in proxies directly.
  - Note: The workdir mentioned above is specified by the -d parameter when the program is started or the CLASH_HOME_DIR environment variable. If neither of the above is specified, the default is:
    - on Unix systems, $HOME/.config/mihomo.
    - on Windows, %USERPROFILE%/.config/mihomo.
