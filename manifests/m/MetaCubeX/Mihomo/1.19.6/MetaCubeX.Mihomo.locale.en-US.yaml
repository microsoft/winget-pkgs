ReleaseNotes: |-
  Incompatible changes:
  - For security reasons, all paths appearing in the configuration file will be limited to workdir (regardless of whether they are relative or absolute). If there is a specific need, please specify additional safe paths by setting the SAFE_PATHS environment variable while ensuring safety. The syntax of this environment variable is the same as the PATH environment variable parsing rules of this operating system (i.e., semicolon-separated under Windows and colon-separated under other systems)
  - In addition, support for specifying routing-mark and interface-name for proxy-groups has been removed. Please specify the relevant parameters in proxies directly.
