  What's Changed
  - The DNS resolution of the overall UDP part has been delayed to the connection initiation stage. It will be triggered only when the IP rule without no-resolve is matched during the rule matching process.
    - For direct and wireguard outbound, the same logic as the TCP part will be followed, that is, when direct-nameserver (or DNS configured by wireguard) exists, the resolution result in the rule matching process will be discarded and the domain name will be re-resolved. This re-resolution logic is only effective for fakeip.
    - For reject and DNS outbound, no resolution is required.
    - For other outbound, resolution will still be performed when the UDP connection is initiated, and the domain name will not be sent directly to the remote server.
  - In addition, the memory usage of the UDP part of tun inbound has also been optimized in this version.
  - Other incompatible updates are the same as v1.19.6~v1.19.8:
  - For security reasons, all paths appearing in the configuration file will be limited to workdir (regardless of whether they are relative or absolute). If there is a specific need, please specify additional safe paths by setting the SAFE_PATHS environment variable while ensuring safety. The syntax of this environment variable is the same as the PATH environment variable parsing rules of this operating system (i.e., semicolon-separated under Windows and colon-separated under other systems)
  - For security reasons, the "path" parameter of /configs in the restful api has been restricted, and its directory also needs to be in workdir or SAFE_PATHS.
  - In addition, support for specifying routing-mark and interface-name for proxy-groups has been removed. Please specify the relevant parameters in proxies directly.
  - Note: The workdir mentioned above is specified by the -d parameter when the program is started or the CLASH_HOME_DIR environment variable. If neither of the above is specified, the default is:
    - on Unix systems, $HOME/.config/mihomo.
    - on Windows, %USERPROFILE%/.config/mihomo.
