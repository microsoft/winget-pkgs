ReleaseNotes: |-
  The built-in Syncthing library was updated to 2.0.13. So be sure to read about the major changes in 2.0 on https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/releases/tag/v2.0.13 if you are using the built-in Syncthing library.
  The built-in Syncthing library also contains the change to skip point-to-point interfaces on Android that did not make it into the official v2.0.13 release. This may help improve battery life.
  The bundled version of Qt also contains a potential fix for deadlocks under Android.
