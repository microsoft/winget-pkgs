ReleaseNotes: |-
  Changelog
  - Support for icons on package lists is now a stable feature!
  - Icons will show on package lists.
  - Icons will be downloaded once and stored on a local cache, to prevent unneeded bandwidth usage.
  - The icon cache is not expected to exceed 10MB of space on a worst-case.
    Cached icons are resized and compressed for less disk usage.
  - VCPkg is available on UniGetUI (thanks @mrixner!).
    This includes
  - Installing, updating and removing vcpkg packages
  - Handling the periodic refresh of the vcpkg local repository (can be opted out)
  - UniGetUI will use UniGetUI Elevator instead of GSudo.
    More info about UniGetUI Elevator here
  - UniGetUI can now automatically delete desktop shortcuts created when updating software (thanks @mrixner!)
  - Internal duplicated procedures will be recycled, so resource-intensive tasks are performed only once.
  - Important improvements to the updater.
  - Users will now be able to opt in to UniGetUI PreRelease versions from UniGetUI Settings.
  - Internal improvements to WinGet package handling
  - WinGet COM API connection is more resilient, and will attempt to reconnect (once) if the connection to the COM Server is lost.
  - Package-fetching operations are more reliable across the board.
    A one-time retry policy has been introduced.
  - Tons of other changes and improvements
