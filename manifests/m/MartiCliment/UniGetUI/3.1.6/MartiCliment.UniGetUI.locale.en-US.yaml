ReleaseNotes: |-
  Changelog
  - Package operations have been greatly improved:
    - Operations bar can be resized and collapsed
    - Live output and Error dialogs have been improved to prevent dialog flooding
    - Operation notifications have been improved, to prevent notification stacking
    - All operations can be canceled at once,
    - Operations have quick actions associated to them:
      - Retry [for failed operations], Retry as admin, etc.
      - Package details, open install location, etc.
      - Skip this version, ignore updates for this app [for failed updates]
      - Etc.
    - Better queue management + concurrency improvements
    - Much more!
  - Installers can be downloaded from package lists. Download operations will show on the operations bar as well.
  - UniGetUI can now be configured to be fully portable, storing settings on the executable directory.
  - A long-standing issue where WinGet would get corrupted on systems where the user didn't have admin privileges has been finally fixed.
  - UniGetUI now has [optional] telemetry, that will serve to understand how the app is used, (and perhaps help create package rankings in the future)
  - Other fixes and improvements.
