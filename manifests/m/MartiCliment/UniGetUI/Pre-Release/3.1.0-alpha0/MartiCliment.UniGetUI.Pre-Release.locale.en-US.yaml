ReleaseNotes: |-
  IMPORTANT:
  This is the first development release to implement the UniGetUI rebranding.
  Instaling this release will automatically migrate settings and other data to new folders (WingetUI -> UniGetUI), so rolling back to older versions of WingetUI may cause settings to be reset.
  Changes
  - Rebranding from WingetUI to UniGetUI
      - Any occurrences of WingetUI have been changed to UniGetUI
      - Settings have been moved from user profile to AppData\Local
  - Improvements to the package managers
      - All dotnet-based package managers do call the nuget api when possible. This dramatically speeds up find packages and loading package details, as well as provides more reliability.
      - All dotnet-based packages will load the official package icon
      - WinGet implements the WinGet COM Api, for improved performance and reliability. WinGet packages do not show elypsis (...) anymore.
      - Microsoft Store packages (currently msix only) will show icons and screenshots
      - The icon caching mechanism has been rebuilt from the grounds up, providing more compatibility with Widgets for WingetUI
  - Improvements to Software pages
  - Better search experience on the Discover Software page
  - Refactoring. Lots of refactoring
  - Other improvements and internal changes.
