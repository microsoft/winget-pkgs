  General changes
  - Fixed a crash that was triggered when bundles were imported
  - Fixed a scenario where UniGetUI wouldn't resume

  - **Important: ** As of this release, it will not possible to create XML and YAML bundles. Existing XML and YAML bundles can be imported, via internal YAML/XML-to-JSON conversion before deserialization. This feature will be removed in a not-near future. Nevertheless, XML and YAML bundles can be also converted to JSON bundles using an older UniGetUI version.
