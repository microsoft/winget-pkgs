ReleaseNotes: |-
  Caution
  PreRelease builds may be unstable and should not be used on a production environment
  General changes
  - A new experimental change has been introduced, which makes UniGetUI consume near to 0% CPU when on background. This setting can be disabled from the settings, under experimental features.
  - A new "Manual Scan" button has been added, so users can manually add more desktop shortcuts to automatically remove. (thanks @mrixner)
  - After some analysis from the telemetry data, I was able to identify and fix some issues causing package operations to fail. The improvements apply to:
    - Chocolatey (fixed some hangs and improved operation output parsing)
    - Pip (removed deprecated flag and improved operation output parsing)
    - Vckpg (better vcpkg update and bootstrapping, significantly improving success rate)
    - .NET Tool (better global tool handling, mostly affecting new installs)
    - Scoop (better error detection and operation output parsing)
    - Cargo (usage of cargo-binstall for faster and more reliable install and update operations)
  - Added a subtitle to the titlebar, what will inform the user when UniGetUI runs under special conditions (administrator, portable, etc.)
  - Fixed a hard crash when UniGetUI can't write to the exe location in portable mode.
  - Improvements to the UI Layout. Hidden pages will be detached from the root, instead of being hidden.
  - Improvements to executable detection (for executables added to PATH)
  - AppSdk was updated to 1.6.5
