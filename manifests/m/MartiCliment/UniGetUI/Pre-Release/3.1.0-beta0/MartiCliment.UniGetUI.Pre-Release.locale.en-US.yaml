ReleaseNotes: |-
  IMPORTANT:
  This is the first beta release to implement the UniGetUI rebranding.
  Instaling this release will automatically migrate settings and other data to new folders (WingetUI -> UniGetUI), so rolling back to older versions of WingetUI may cause settings to be reset.
  Note: When it comes to features, this release should be quite similar to the stable 3.1.0 releaseChanges
  - Packages will be loaded and stored by a Package Loader, instead of being loaded by the interface.
  - Package lists have been rebuilt to use ItemsView, causing UniGetUI to use less ram (~290mb max -> ~210mb max)
  - The Widgets API has been optimized. Packages load up to way faster on the widgets.
  - The Package Manager logs have been rebuilt from the grounds up.
      - Package Manager logs for each manager can be isolated
      - Normal and Verbose views available
  - Improvements to keyboard navigation
  - Chocolatey can be set to not be installed by the UniGetUI Installer
  - Lots of internal code changes and optimizations.
  - Other bugfixes
