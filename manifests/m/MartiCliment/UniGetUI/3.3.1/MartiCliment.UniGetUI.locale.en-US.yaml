ReleaseNotes: |-
  Changelog
  - Adress executable corruption/integrity detection and semi-automatic resolution:
    - UniGetUI will check for corruption issues. If found, the user will be prompted to repair them.
    - The crash report will contain an integrity report
  - In both cases, if UniGetUI detects an integrity violation and the UniGetUI installer is placed on the installation directory (which will be by default since this release), UniGetUI will ask the user to confirm to start an automated reinstall process.
  - UniGetUI can be reinstalled from Windows Apps and Features -> UniGetUI -> Modify. This will force a reinstall
  - Fixed crashes and issues with GitHub cloud backup and GitHub login
  - Fixed an issue where certain in-app popups wouldn't show the acrylic background properly
  - Migrated to AppSdk Titlebar, and removed WinUIEx as a dependency
  - Improvements to UniGetUI Elevator
  - Fix a few UI crashes and deadlocks involving loading dialogs
  - Reverted a Toolbar UI change that combined different options into a menu. Now the main action has its own button again
