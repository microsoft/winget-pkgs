ReleaseNotes: |-
  ci_0.4.32_2025-02-03_19-23
  Good news
  v0.4.32
  - It looks like in the newer versions of fzf the command that was used to "execute and exit" no longer works.
    - A quick fix is to simply migrate to fzf's new become command, which almost does the same thing.
    - This is a breaking change for holder versions of fzf however, and users using fzf shipped with ubuntu 22 and below should stick with old version for now
  v0.4.31
  - Bump version purely for CI
  v0.4.30
  - Fix display issue with new fzf ( no longer use \n as delimiter )
  v0.4.29
  - Revert multi-select preview, since it conflicts with incremental preview :(
  - Add PowerShell flag '\r' flag under windows
  v0.4.28
  - Give up on trying to solve windows edge cases, instead of not working at all, it now works for utf-8 only
  v0.4.26
  - Reduce allocations
  - Preview multi-selects
  - Fewer dependencies
  - More robust signal handling
  Released by CI
