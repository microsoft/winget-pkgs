ReleaseNotes: |-
  We has provided more ways of previewing documents for editors having poor lsp support.
  - Default Preview: The editors supporting lsp commands, e.g. neovim and helix, can use tinymist.startDefaultPreview to start a browsing preview server directly.
  - Background Preview: The editors not supporting lsp commands can use the background preview feature to start a preview server in background. You can bind a shortcut editor to open the preview in browser.
  See the Issue: Preview feature for all editors for unimplemented features.

  Full Changelog: https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/compare/v0.13.6...v0.13.8

  v0.13.6
  - Provided tinymist documentation in PDF format in https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pull/1485
  Compiler
  - (Fix) Getting task options from configuration in https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pull/1449
  - (Fix) Displaying ProjectInsId without quoting in https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pull/1476
    - This made document summary not working.
  - (Perf) Parallelizing and synchronously waiting font loading in https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pull/1470
  Code Analysis
  - (Fix) Identifying chained dot access when matching atomic expression in markup mode in https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pull/1488 and https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pull/1489
    - When completing #a.b.|, the second . was viewed as a text dot and failed to trigger the field completion. It now reparses correctly.
  - Made file type recognition by file extension case-insensitive in https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pull/1472
    - For example, IMAGE.PNG is recognized as an image file now.
  Editor
  - (Fix) Combining VS Code language specific default settings into one block by @0risc in https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pull/1462
  Completion
  - (Fix) Skipping argument completion when the cursor is on the right parenthesis in https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pull/1480
  - (Fix) Distinguished content value from content type in https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pull/1482
    - math.op("+") was wrongly inferred as an element function (type), instead of a value having the element type.
  - Adjusting range of label and reference completions in https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pull/1443 and https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pull/1444
    - It becomes more sensible when you request completions from anywhere on the labels or references.
  - Unifying and improving function and method completion in https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pull/1478
    - The was affecting show outline.entry. It was completing e| as entry() instead of entry.
  - Skip completion of types having no constructors or scopes in https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pull/1481
    - For example, content is not completed.
  - Completing std module in https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pull/1483
    - std is in neither global scope nor math scope, so we have to handle it manually.
  - Accepting arbitrary expressions in show rules in https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pull/1484
    - For example, show: s| now can be completed as show: std|, and so that further completed as show: std.scale(..). It was not working because modules were filtered out as not a valid show transform function.
  Preview
  - Added support to run preview server in background in https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pull/1233
  - Added tinymist.startDefaultPreview and revised documentation about preview in https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pull/1448
