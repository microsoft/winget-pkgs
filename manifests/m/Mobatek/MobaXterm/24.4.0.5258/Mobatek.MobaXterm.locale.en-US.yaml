ShortDescription: Enhanced terminal for Windows with X11 server, tabbed SSH client, network tools and much more
Description: |-
  MobaXterm is your ultimate toolbox for remote computing. In a single Windows application, it provides loads of functions that are tailored for programmers, webmasters, IT administrators and pretty much all users who need to handle their remote jobs in a more simple fashion.
  MobaXterm provides all the important remote network tools (SSH, RDP, X11, SFTP, FTP, Telnet, Rlogin, ...) to Windows desktop, in a single portable exe file which works out of the box. Some plugins can be used to add functions to MobaXterm such as Unix commands (bash, ls, cat, sed, grep, awk, rsync, ...).
