ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Fixes a potential data corruption bug in KeyVault.rewrapManyDataKey() when rotating encrypted data encryption keys backed by Azure or GCP key services.

  In previous versions of mongosh, this bug occurs when an Azure-backed or GCP-backed data encryption key being rewrapped requires fetching an access token for decryption of the data encryption key.

  As a result of this bug, all data encryption keys being rewrapped are replaced by new randomly generated material, destroying the original key material.

  To mitigate potential data corruption, upgrade mongosh to v1.5.4 or higher before using KeyVault.rewrapManyDataKey() to rotate Azure-backed or GCP-backed data encryption keys. 
  You should always create a backup of the key vault collection before key rotation.
