ShortDescription: Mullvad Browser is a privacy-focused web browser developed in collaboration between Mullvad VPN and the Tor Project. It's produced to minimize tracking and fingerprinting.
Description: When you visit a website, you can be identified and tracked through your IP address, third-party cookies, all kinds of tracking scripts, and through so called browser fingerprints. That’s why masking your IP address is not enough to stop the data collection. However, by using a trustworthy VPN in combination with a privacy-focused browser, you can put up a better resistance against the mass surveillance of today. That's why we partnered with the Tor Project to develop Mullvad Browser – a browser designed to minimize tracking and fingerprints.
