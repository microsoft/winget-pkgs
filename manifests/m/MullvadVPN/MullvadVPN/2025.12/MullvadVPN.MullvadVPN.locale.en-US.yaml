ReleaseNotes: |-
  This release is for Windows only.
  This release is based on 2025.10 with the addition of a fix for a BSOD that some users experienced.
  Here is a list of all changes since last stable release 2025.11:
  Added
  - Add helpful warnings when clearing account history. This helps users not lose their account
    numbers.
  Windows
  - Add additional logging for tunnel devices and split tunneling to problem reports.
  - Log WFP sessions when transaction lock timeout occurs.
  Changed
  - Move placement of login button from inside the account number input to under account number.
  Windows
  - Implement UDP GSO for QUIC on client socket. This improves download speeds slightly.
  Fixed
  - Fix version being labeled unsupported unexpectedly. So far, this only an issue when using
    development builds.
  - QUIC obfuscation only using one in-address when connecting. It will now randomly select one of
    the available in-addresses for each connection attempt.
  - quinn_udp crate flooding mullvad-daemon.log with warnings.
  Windows
  - Mitigate BSOD caused by split tunnel driver during boot.
  macOS
  - Fix apps attempting to use IPv6 with in-tunnel IPv6 disabled.
  - Re-add missing loopback alias if removed. This fixes some issues with DNS resolution.
  Security
  Windows
  - Block traffic to exit node from non-Mullvad processes. This fixes a leak where traffic could be
    encrypted once, but leave the entry node unencrypted, if and only if the destination were the exit
    node. E.g., this might occur if a browser tries to open a TCP connection to the exit node IP.
