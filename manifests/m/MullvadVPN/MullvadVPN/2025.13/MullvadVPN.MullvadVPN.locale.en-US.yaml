ReleaseNotes: |-
  This release is for desktop only.
  Here is a list of all changes since last stable release 2025.12:
  Added
  - Add settings reset command to the CLI ('mullvad reset-settings').
  - Make feature indicators in connection panel navigate to the relevant setting when clicked.
  - Add Lightweight WireGuard Obfuscation method (LWO). This is a cheap obfuscation method that
    prevents packets from being identified as standard WireGuard packets.
  - Add possibility to manage devices from account view.
  Changed
  - Add validation for API access methods to only allow unique names. Access methods with
    duplicated names will be renamed.
  - Change how externally triggered navigation is handled in the UI. This could potentially reduce
    issues where users get stuck in the out-of-time view.
  - Update Electron from 36.5.0 to 37.6.0.
  - Run version check hourly and when interacting with the app instead of once per day.
  - Add support for gradual rollouts of new app releases
  Fixed
  - Fix bug introduced in 2025.13-beta1 with translations sometimes not being formatted
    correctly.
  macOS
  - Fix high CPU usage on macOS 26 by updating Electron. This affected the app when it was visible.
  Linux
  - Install AppArmor profile on all Linux distributions that support AppArmor abi 4.0.
