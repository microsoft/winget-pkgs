ReleaseNotes: |-
  This release is for desktop only.
  Here is a list of all changes since last stable release 2024.1.
  Added
  - Add automatic MTU detection for desktop platforms. This currently only uses information about dropped packets and does not take fragmentation into account.
  - Add ability to import server IP overrides in GUI.
  Changed
  - Change default obfuscation setting to auto.
  - Migrate obfuscation settings for existing users from off to auto.
  - Change default retry connection attempts.
  Fixed
  - Continual excessive attempts to update the API IP were made after testing access methods.
  - Fix pointless API access method rotations for concurrent requests.
  - Fix daemon rotating logs on startup even if another daemon is already running.
  - Fix missing redirect to out of time-view when running out of time.
  - Fix incorrectly showing "App lost contact with system service" notification on suspend.
  - Fix bug where the app would fail to select an existing relay in some scenarios, causing the user to wrongly end up in a blocked state.
  macOS
  - DNS was not properly restored in some cases when using custom DNS.
  Security
  macOS
  - Flush states on tunnel state changes. Previously, pre-existing connections could leak when internet sharing was enabled on a device.
  Windows
  - Update electron-builder to 24.13.3 to fix CVE-2024-27303, which enabled privilege escelation when running the installer.
