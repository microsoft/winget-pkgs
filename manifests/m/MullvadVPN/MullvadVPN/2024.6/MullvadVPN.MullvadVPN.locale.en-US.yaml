ReleaseNotes: |-
  This release is for desktop only.
  Here is a list of all changes since last stable release 2024.5.

  Added
  - Add WireGuard over Shadowsocks obfuscation. It can be enabled in "WireGuard settings".
    This will also be used automatically when connecting fails with other methods.
  - Add feature indicators to the main view along with redesigning the connection details.
  - Add "Smart Routing" feature which simplifies connecting to DAITA-enabled relays.

  Changed
  - Never use OpenVPN as a fallback protocol when any of the following features is enabled:
    multihop, quantum-resistant tunnels, or DAITA.
  - Improved output format of mullvad status command, which now also prints feature indicators.
  - Move DAITA and multihop to the root settings view along with moving multihop into a dedicated view with more information.
  macOS
  - Disable split tunnel interface when disconnected.
    This prevents traffic from being sent through the daemon when the VPN is disconnected.
  - Enable IPv6 by default. This fixes DNS and routing being broken on some systems.
  - Proxy DNS queries through a local resolver.

  Fixed
  Linux
  - Set tunnel name to `wg0-mullvad` for userspace WireGuard.
  macOS
  - Exclude programs when executed using a relative path from a shell.
  - Reduce packet loss when using split tunneling.
  - Don't block fragmented packets in the PF firewall.
    Fixes various issues relating to connecting (and general instability) when IP fragmentation is present.
  - Fix Apple services not working by forcing stray connections out through the VPN tunnel.
    This fix only applies to Wireguard, OpenVPN is still affected.
  - Disable DNS redirect when custom DNS is set to localhost.
