ReleaseNotes: |-
  This release is for desktop only.
  Here is a list of all changes since last stable release 2024.5.

  Added
  - Add WireGuard over Shadowsocks obfuscation. It can be enabled in "WireGuard settings".
    This will also be used automatically when connecting fails with other methods.
  - Add feature indicators to the main view along with redesigning the connection details.
  - Add "Smart Routing" feature which simplifies connecting to DAITA-enabled relays.
  macOS
  - Add "Apple services bypass" toggle that let's users unblock certain Apple-owned networks.
    This is a temporary fix to the MacOS 15 issues where some Apple services are being blocked.

  Changed
  - Never use OpenVPN as a fallback protocol when any of the following features is enabled: multihop, quantum-resistant tunnels, or DAITA.
  - Improved output format of mullvad status command, which now also prints feature indicators.
  macOS
  - Disable split tunnel interface when disconnected.
    This prevents traffic from being sent through the daemon when the VPN is disconnected.

  Fixed
  Linux
  - Set tunnel name to `wg0-mullvad` for userspace WireGuard.
