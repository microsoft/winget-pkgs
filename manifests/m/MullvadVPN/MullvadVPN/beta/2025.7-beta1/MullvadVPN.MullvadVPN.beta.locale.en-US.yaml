ReleaseNotes: |-
  This release is for desktop only.
  Here is a list of all changes since last release 2025.6.

  Added
  - Add notification that shows when the user is connected to WireGuard
    with a port that is not supported.
  Linux
  - The deb package repositores now have static codenames on top of
    the existing distro version specific codenames.
    The stable repository always have the "stable" codename,
    and the beta repository has the "beta" codename.

  Changed
  - Replace Classic McEliece with HQC as one of the post-quantum safe
    key exchange mechanisms used for the quantum-resistant tunnels.
    The main benefits here are that HQC uses a lot less CPU to compute the keypair,
    and the public key sent to the server is drastically smaller.

  Fixed
  - Automatically connect when IP version becomes available.
  Linux
  - Fix syntax error in Apparmor profile.
  - Fix issue where settings were lost after an upgrade if `mullvad-daemon`
    was not restarted before `mullvad-early-boot-blocking.service``.
    That is, before a reboot.
  Windows
  - Fix issue where daemon got stuck trying to connect only over IPv4 (or only IPv6).
  macOS
  - Fully uninstall the app when it is removed by being dropped in the bin.

  Security
  macOS
  - Fix potential local privilege escalation when app was incorrectly removed
    by being dropped in the bin but still leaving behind a launch daemon.
    This fixes CVE-2025-46351 reported by Egor Filatov (Positive Technologies).
