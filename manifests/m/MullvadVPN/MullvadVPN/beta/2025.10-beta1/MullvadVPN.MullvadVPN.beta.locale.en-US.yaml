ReleaseNotes: |-
  This release is for desktop only.
  Here is a list of all changes since last release 2025.9.

  Added
  - Add helpful warnings when clearing account history.
    This helps users not lose their account numbers.
  Windows
  - Add additional logging for tunnel devices and split tunneling to problem reports.
  - Log WFP sessions when transaction lock timeout occurs.

  Changed
  - Move placement of login button from inside the account number input to under account number.
  Windows
  - Implement UDP GSO for QUIC on client socket.
    This improves download speeds slightly.

  Security
  Windows
  - Block traffic to exit node from non-Mullvad processes.
    This fixes a leak where traffic could be encrypted once,
    but leave the entry node unencrypted,
    if and only if the destination were the exit node.
    E.g., this might occur if a browser tries to open a TCP connection to the exit node IP.

  Fixed
  - Fix version being labeled unsupported unexpectedly.
    So far, this only an issue when using development builds.
  macOS
  - Fix apps attempting to use IPv6 with in-tunnel IPv6 disabled.
  - Re-add missing loopback alias if removed.
    This fixes some issues with DNS resolution.
