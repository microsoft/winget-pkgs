ReleaseNotes: |-
  This release is for desktop only.
  Here is a list of all changes since last release 2025.7.

  Added
  - Add in-app updates to Windows and macOS.
    This new feature lets you download, verify,
    and install new versions from within the app.
  Linux
  - Make it possible to run the app with cgroups v1 fully disabled.
    Note that split tunneling is currently unavailable when this is the case.
  Windows
  - Add a button to start the Mullvad VPN system service
    if it's unavailable at launch

  Changed
  macOS
  - Use a local DNS resolver on the 127.0.0.0/8 network,
    regardless of macOS version.
  Windows
  - Make firewall rules applied while upgrading the app not persist on reboot,
    unless "Lockdown mode" or "Auto-connect"
    along with "Launch app on start-up" is enabled.
    This serves as a safety fallback if the update fails
    and the user is left with blocking firewall rules and no app.

  Fixed
  macOS
  - Add grace period when best default route goes away
    to reduce frequency of random reconnects.

  Security
  - Prevent unprivileged users from impersonating the gRPC server.
    This was relatively harmless previously but is required due to in-app updates.
  Windows
  - Enable control flow integrity checks (CFG) for some C++ code.
    This excludes `wintun`, `wireguard-nt`, and OpenVPN.
    This addresses `MLLVD-CR-24-101` to the extent that we found it valuable.
