ReleaseNotes: |-
  Hot Hot Hot
  1 hot for the new Speech to Text model downloader
  2 hots for the new System Fusion and improved System UI themes
  3 hots for your CPU cooking on the new Outline video filter!
  - Added a Whisper.cpp (GGML) model downloader to the Speech to Text dialog.
    A model is no longer included in the download and installation reducing their sizes.
  - Improved the System theme to follow the operating system palette on Windows (darker and more contrast), and improved its appearance on macOS dark mode.
  - Added Settings > Theme > System Fusion that combines the operating system palette with the monochrome, symbolic icons of the Fusion themes.
  - Added an Outline video filter that uses the input alpha channel--useful with rich text or assets with a transparent background.
    This means that, like Drop Shadow, it will not work as expected when used after a text filter on a video or image clip. Rather, you must use a text clip (transparent color generator with text filter) on an upper track.
  Other New Features
  - Added the ability to drag the waveform peak line to adjust audio gain.
  - Added Settings > Timeline > Adjust Clip Gain/Volume to turn off the above.
  - Added rolling an edit/trim to Timeline:
    Hold Ctrl (command on macOS) while trimming to simultaneously trim the neighbor clip.
  - Added a Soft Focus filter set.
  - Added Audio/Video duration to the Slideshow Generator dialog, defaults to 4 hours.
    This facilitates using Slideshow Generator to make transitions between everything when including both video and images. (It still respects the source duration and in & out points; duration here is a maximum.)
  Surround Sound Mixing Improvements
  - Added fader and surround balance to the Balance audio filter if channels > 2.
  - Added Channels toggle buttons to many audio filters:
    - Band Pass
    - Compressor
    - Delay
    - Downmix
    - Equalizer: 3-Band
    - Equalizer: 15-Band
    - Equalizer: Parametric
    - Expander
    - Gain/Volume
    - High Pass
    - Low Pass
    - Limiter
    - Mute
    - Noise Gate
    - Notch
  - Added support for 4 channels in the Copy Channel audio filter.
  For example, now you can:
  - Copy stereo music to the rear channels and use the fader in the Balance filter to reduce its volume,
  - Downmix spoken word into the center channel and apply a Band Pass filter to it, and
  - Route music or sound effects to the low-frequency channels and apply a Low Pass filter to it.
  Other Improvements
  - Changed the default Export > Audio > Rate control to Average Bitrate for AAC, Opus, and MP3.
  - Added the ability to add/use multiple Mask: Apply filters.
  - Added support for Scrub While Dragging to trimming on the timeline.
  - Added hold Shift to ripple-trim when Ripple is turned off.
  - Added French (Canadian) and Lithuanian translations.
  Fixes
  - Fixed Mask: Apply with multiple Mask: Simple Shape (broke in v25.05)
  - Fixed exporting projects containing only Generator clips on Windows (broke in v25.05).
  - Fixed converting 10-bit full to limited range (broke in v25.01).
  - Fixed dropdown menus using Settings > Theme > System on Windows.
  - Fixed Balance and Pan audio muted channels if audio channels > 2.
  - Fixed Export > Use hardware encoder fails with H.264 on macOS 15.
  - Fixed Properties > Convert or Reverse for iPhone 16 Pro videos with Ambisonic audio.
  - Fixed a single frame fade out filter would either mute or make black.
  - Fixed repairing a project (e.g. broken file links) with proxy turned on.
  - Fixed doing Freeze Frame on the first frame of a clip.
