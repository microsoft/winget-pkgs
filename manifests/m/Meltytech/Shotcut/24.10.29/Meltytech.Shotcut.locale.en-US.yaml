  Speech to Text
  Shotcut gets its first AI based on OpenAI's Whisper, courtesy of the whisper.cpp project. This is available through Subtitles > Speech to Text menu item or button: .
  - Our builds include a basic model that has decent speed and accuracy but not a big size. (You can think of the model as the brain.)
  - You can download a bigger and better better brain (model) in ggml format and configure it in the Speech to Text dialog, but it will be slower.
  - The dialog creates two jobs that appear in the Jobs panel: one to export audio and another to convert to text.
  - The results are added to the Subtitles panel as a new top-level Subtitle Track.
  - Currently, the only GPU our build supports is Apple Silicon. Otherwise, it is heavily multi-threaded on the CPU.
  - Known quirk: subtitle items sometimes start earlier than expected. Timing is provided by the model and tool, and we lack the skills and resources to improve this.
  - Expect there to be occasional errors. Like humans and non-ideal conditions, it is not perfect. We will not take action on bug reports about some piece of audio not converting to the expected text.
  - OpenAI has made some warnings about the usage of their Whisper models:
  In particular, we caution against using Whisper models to transcribe recordings of individuals taken without their consent.... We recommend against use in high-risk domains like decision-making contexts, where flaws in accuracy can lead to pronounced flaws in outcomes.
  Transition Improvements
  - Ripple Delete a transition restores the entirety of the clips included in the transition.
  - Lift (non-ripple delete) a transition no longer leaves a gap; the gap is filled with the adjacent clips.
  - Moving an adjacent clip away increases the transition duration instead of detaching and leaving a gap.
  Other Improvements
  - Removed the Export > Video > Resample button. Now, there are simply ignorable inline warnings when making certain changes.
  - Added File > Show Project in Folder to menu.
  - Added a decimals <number> option to numeric keywords in the GPS Text video filter.
  - Changed Recent Projects to Projects: items in this view no longer disappear as Recent reaches its maximum length and old items are removed.
  - Added a Remove action to the context menu in Projects.
  - Hide the Reframe video filter and button if GPU Effects is on.
  - Upgraded FFmpeg to version 7.1.
  Fixes
  - Fixed a crash doing when doing more than one Playlist > menu > Add Selected to Slideshow. In theory, this could fix other random crashes in Timeline.
  - Fixed a crash opening a project containing a subtitle track with no items.
  - Fixed odd value for computed width in Reframe output video filter causes export to fail.
  - Fixed Reframe visual control can create odd-valued dimensions.
  - Fixed AVCHD video frame rate is double (could fix other formats).
  - Fixed making a proxy video for a iPhone 16 Pro video containing spatial audio.
  - Fixed GPU filters paste below non-GPU filters.
  - Fixed Slideshow Generator dialog is too tall with vertical video mode.
  - Fixed GPS Offset would reset in GPS Text video filter.
  - Fixed the maximum allowed Time in the Time Remap filter to prevent white frames.
