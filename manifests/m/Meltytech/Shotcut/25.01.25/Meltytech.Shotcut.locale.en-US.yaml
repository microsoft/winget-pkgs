  Fixes and Changes
  - Improved Playlist > Generate Slideshow with trimmed video clips making it more useful to make a montage.
  - Fixed incorrect color change when mixing video tracks and certain filters such as Hue/Lightness/Saturation.
  - Fixed scrub bar and Timeline & Keyframes rulers not using Settings > Time Format.
  - Fixed File > Export > Markers as Chapters when Settings > Time Format is not Clock.
  - Fixed Subtitles works incorrectly after a couple of minutes with non-integer frame rates.
  - Fixed Settings > Clear Recent on Exit not clearing the Projects list.
  - Fixed View > Application Log > Previous not appearding on Windows.
  - Fixed changing Properties > Duration of image on Timeline not adjusting video filters keyframes.
  - Fixed Properties > Export GPX not working with GoPro HERO 11, 12 & 13.
  - Fixed Export > Presets > lossless > H.264 with NVIDIA hardware encoder.
  - Fixed "Use font size" in Text: Simple, GPS Text, Subtitle Burn In and Timer filters not applying from a saved preset.
  - Fixed the color picker (pick color from screen) when Shotcut is not on the primary screen.
  - Fixed the color picker on the Wayland graphics subsystem in Linux.
  - Fixed drag-n-drop from the Source player on Wayland for Linux.
  - Added native support for Wayland (without Xwayland) in the Flatpak for Linux.
  - Fixed unable to extend duration of text clips made by Subtitles > Generate Text on Timeline.
  - Fixed Properties > Convert job progress when deinterlacing or changing frame rate.
  - Fixed the subtitle track and times on ruler disapper when Timeline is floated.
  - Fixed the Delete and Clear actions in the Text: Rich editor not working.
  - Export preset H.264 High Profile now defaults to a higher quality 65% than YouTube or the defaults.
  - Removed File > Open Other > JACK Audio on Linux to remove the hard run-time dependency on libjack.so for Shotcut. However, that library is still needed to get some of the bundled audio filters (unless they load from system-installed "swh" LADSPA plugins).
  - Improved support for pix_fmt=yuv420p10le or yuv444p10le, colorspace=2020, color_trc=arib-std-b67 or smpte2084 in Export > Other for 10-bit pass-through (i.e. no image effects) editing without GPU Effects (i.e. rudimentary HDR editing without adequate preview).
  - Upgraded dependencies: MLT 7.30.0, Qt 6.8.1, dav1d 1.5.0, AOM AV1 3.11.0, OpenCV 4.10, libvpx 1.15.0, Opus 1.5.2, WebP 1.5.0, SVT-AV1 2.3.0
