  New üéâ‚öôÔ∏è
  New Feature: MultiPlates

  Multiplate lets you manage and prepare multiple build plates in a single project. You can now organize your entire print workflow in one workspace , whether you're working with resin or FDM. Key Highlights:
  - Add up to 49 plates manually - Perfect for batch printing, multi-model setups, and complex projects
  - Adding Plates: Add a new plate directly from: The 3D view - The object and plate list
  - The ‚ÄúOutside‚Äù Plate: The Outside plate automatically collects objects from a plate that was deleted. It does not include all objects outside a build plate (unlike Bambu Studio). So an object may appear outside the plate in the 3D view but not be listed in the Outside plate. If you delete a plate containing objects, those objects will move to the ‚ÄúOutside‚Äù plate.
  - Quick Selection Shortcut: Select all objects on the active plate using `Ctrl + Shift + A` Note: This shortcut currently does not select supports in Prepare mode ‚Äî that‚Äôs coming in the next release!
  - Moving Objects Between Plates using: Right-click in the object list - Right-click in the 3D view - The gizmo - Directly editing position values in the input fields
  Lite Users Can: Edit a plate - Rename a plate - Hide a plate - Select a plate for slicing
  ‚úÖ Available on: Lychee Slicer Lite (restricted), Lychee Slicer Plus, Lychee Library, Trial plans
  New Shortcut: Copy & Paste (Ctrl + C / Ctrl + V)
  It‚Äôs a small but super useful shortcut that lets you quickly duplicate models using standard keyboard commands.
  - In Layout: Copy and paste objects within the same plate or across multiple plates
  - In Prepare: Copy and paste hole settings, hollow blockers, and supports
  - You can also copy an object from one scene and paste it into a new scene
  ‚úÖ Available on: Lychee Slicer Lite (restricted), Lychee Slicer Plus, Lychee Library, Trial plans
