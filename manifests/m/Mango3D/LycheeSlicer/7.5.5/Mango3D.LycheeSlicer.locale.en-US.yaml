ReleaseNotes: |-
  Auto Support Improvements & New Printer Support. This stable release focuses on refining the new Auto Support system introduced in 7.5, making it more precise, smarter and more reliable, while also adding support for a highly requested printer. [HOTFIX 7.5.5] We fixed an issue where overhang supports were no longer working.
  New 🎉

  New Resin Printers Compatibility
  - Piocreate Halot X1
  Auto Support Improvements ⚙️

  Improved Overhang Support System
  - Added dynamic spacing based on angle
  - Users can define spacing at 0° and at a maximum angle
  - Added 3 new overhang support presets, automatically calculated based on supported volume

  Smarter Support Placement Between Close Islands
  - When two islands are closer than the support tip size, only one support is now placed
  - This single support efficiently supports both islands
  - Result: fewer supports, cleaner prints

  Maximum Angle for Reinforcement & Stabilization
  - Added a maximum angle parameter for reinforcement and stabilization supports
  - Works similarly to overhang angle settings
  - Gives better control over where supports are generated

  Improved Reinforcement Point Placement
  - Reinforcement points are now prioritized on overhang surfaces
  - Leads to stronger structural support where it matters most

  Mini Support Filtering
  - Added a filtering system to prevent extremely small mini supports
  - Reduces unnecessary supports and improves print cleanliness
