ReleaseNotes: |-
  üöÄ Editable list of file types (PRO) Settingsü°¢Advanced. This affects components like preview, metadata, thumbnails.
  For example: if file extension is in Video files list will be delegated to MediaPlayer component, and if Windows has a codec to preview that file type (either built-in or provided through 3rd party system extension), the player will be able to play it. There is no way to auto-detect this so the list is user-editable. Same is for audio files, pictures (to get resolution, preview), photos (to try getting camera metadata in second column of Adaptive view), etc.
  üöÄ Drop file onto .ps1 or .py to run it with that script. Mouse over shows blue 'Open with' cursor
  ‚öôÔ∏è Editable list of 'Executable' script file types (mentioned above) (PRO only)
  ‚öôÔ∏è Editable double-click threshold (Settingsü°¢Advanced) to fix accidental mouse doubleclick (debounce time / noisy mouse buttons)
  üõ†Ô∏è Disable double-click to open during Ctrl selection
  üêû Bugfixes related to File View Designer and Shortcuts Editor

  üõ†Ô∏è OneCommander Connector 1.12 - Reverted to previous shortcut combination for accessing Address bar of Open/Save dialogs; the only exception is for Russian language. Please report if it doesn't work for your keyboard language
