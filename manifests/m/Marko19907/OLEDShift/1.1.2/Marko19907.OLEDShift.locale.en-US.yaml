ShortDescription: A small system tray utility that moves around the windows on the screen to prevent burn-in
Description: One of the main ideas behind this program is to be as minimal as possible and to use as little resources as possible so that it can run in the background with minimal impact on the system. It uses less than 2MB of RAM on my system, launch time is nearly instant.
