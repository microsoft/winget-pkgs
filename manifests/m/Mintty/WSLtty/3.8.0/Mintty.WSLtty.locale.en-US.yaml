ShortDescription: Mintty as a terminal for Bash on Ubuntu on Windows / WSL
Tags:
- tty
- wsl
ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Update to Mintty 3.8.0.
  - Derive default icon from WSL launcher shortcut (mintty/wsltty#110).
  Revised WSL launching
  This release drops the wslbridge gateways by default, since there were
  notoriously frequent cases where they would have failed to work.
  Launching WSL with the Windows built-in default launcher, however,
  used to be a crook solution as it obstructed transparent terminal operation
  by hooking the Windows conhost layer into the workflow.
  This deficiency can now be compensated by patching an updated ʻconhost.exeʻ
  into Windows; see instructions about ʻconhostʻ in the mintty wiki
  Tips.
