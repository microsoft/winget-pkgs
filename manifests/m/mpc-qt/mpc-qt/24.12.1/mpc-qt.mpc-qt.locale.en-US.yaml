ShortDescription: Media Player Classic Qute Theater
Description: |
  A clone of Media Player Classic reimplemented in Qt.

  Media Player Classic Home Cinema (mpc-hc) is considered by many to be the
  quintessential media player for the Windows desktop. Media Player Classic Qute
  Theater (mpc-qt) aims to reproduce most of the interface and functionality of
  mpc-hc while using libmpv to play video instead of DirectShow.
