Description: |-
  Executor the desktop workflow application for Windows. Speed up your daily workflow, opening things and doing things.

  Key Features:
  - Launch applications, files, folders, websites, web services (with parameters) and prompts in milliseconds.
  - Trigger multiple actions with one text command and/or hotkey.
  - Let's be an expert in opening up the world instead of trying to put the whole world inside of Executor (as some alternatives try to do).
  - Take the clipboard to a new level, swiftly trigger system commands, do fast calculations, manage running applications and more.
  - Tailor keywords, appearance, hotkeys, and behavior to perfectly match your daily workflow.
  - Customize the look and feel with various skins and theming options to match your desktop setup.
