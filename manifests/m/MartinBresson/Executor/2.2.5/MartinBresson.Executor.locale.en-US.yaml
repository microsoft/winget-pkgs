  What's New
  - keyword command now supports indexed item names:
    - Probably most useful in multi commands. This can save you some trouble of creating keywords for multi launch operations. If for example you want a keyword launching both Visual Studio Code, GitHub Desktop and Docker Desktop, you can normally do this in several ways. Create a keywords for each app (vscode,gitdesk,dockerdesk) and set keyword command to vscode||gitdesk||dockerdesk, or don't create any keywords and use full paths C:\SomeLongPath\Code.exe||C:\SomeLongPath\GitHubDesktop.exe||C:\SomeLongPath\DockerDesktop.exe. Now you can also use the indexed names Visual Studio Code||GitHub Desktop||Docker Desktop.
    - you can also combine all three methods (keyword, file-path, indexed name). Example: vscode||C:\SomeLongPath\GitHubDesktop.exe||Docker Desktop
    - This can also be used in single commands. Example: keyword command: Visual Studio Code as an alternative to keyword command: C:\Users\<name>\AppData\Local\Programs\Microsoft VS Code\Code.exe
    - An obvious downside to relying on indexed names is if suddenly the indexed name change, if for example the publisher make changes to their app name (or item is not indexed anymore). Also individual keywords give you more control of how each item launch.
    - Keyword names identical to indexed item names will have precedence.
    - In case this feature somehow interferes with your flow you can disable it, or limit it to only support indexed shortcuts (.lnk files) and not other indexed file types or folders, by changing the value resolveindexed in executor.ini. See hidden settings for more info.
    - The check for index names is not case sensitive, so both "Visual Studio Code" and "visual studio code" will work.
    - Limitation: Currently the icon of an indexed item will not be resolved if using a single indexed item as a keyword command (it's a performance thing being looked into). You can still manually set an icon for the keyword, also in the keyword editor there's a new icon option action to set icon from an indexed item name.

  - Running multi commands of indexed items also works directly from the input field, so you can type Visual Studio Code||GitHub Desktop||Docker Desktop (with autocompletion and using arrow keys etc.), that then launch these and puts this as one entry into the history for fast recall (if for example you don't bother making a keyword to launch these).

  - In the keyword editor the "Reset icon" link has been replaced by a "Icon options" link, which will open a menu with several icon options.
  - Added the keyword command $SETOPENTEXTKEYWORD$ this can change the keyword that is used to "open text using a keyword" when input is not using a keyword, without having to go to settings. "Open text as a keyword" is a feature that can be enabled in Settings > Misc, where you can also change this keyword (screenshot). See docs for more info.
