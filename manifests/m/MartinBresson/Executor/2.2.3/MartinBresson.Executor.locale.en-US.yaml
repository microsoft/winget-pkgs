Description: |-
  Executor the desktop workflow application for Windows. Speed up your daily workflow, opening things and doing things.

  Key Features:
  - Launch applications, files, folders, websites, web services (with parameters) and prompts in milliseconds.
  - Trigger multiple actions with one text command and/or hotkey.
  - Let's be an expert in opening up the world instead of trying to put the whole world inside of Executor (as some alternatives try to do).
  - Take the clipboard to a new level, swiftly trigger system commands, do fast calculations, manage running applications and more.
  - Tailor keywords, appearance, hotkeys, and behavior to perfectly match your daily workflow.
  - Customize the look and feel with various skins and theming options to match your desktop setup.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Improvements
  - Added that if you use the pressing enter on invalid input will "open text using a keyword" option (Settings &gt Misc), you can define a list of "starts-with text" that should never be text launched. Per default it contains "?", so in case you make a typo like ?sheep (instead of ?sleep) it will not launch this using a keyword. The setting is found in executor.ini and named launchignorelist. See hidden settings for more info.
  - Keyword commands that contains double quoted filepaths will now display the icon for that filepath instead of the default Executor icon.
  - The keyword editor filter search now supports empty text values using "". For example comment:"" will list all keywords with an empty comment field.
  - The icon: filter in the keyword editor, now supports "starts-with" using the icon filepath. So for example icon:c:\icons will show all matches where the icon is located in c:\icons
  - The installer now has better versioning information for package managers etc. (once new the installer has been installed).
