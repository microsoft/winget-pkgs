Description: |-
  Executor the desktop workflow application for Windows. Speed up your daily workflow, opening things and doing things.

  Key Features:
  - Launch applications, files, folders, websites, web services (with parameters) and prompts in milliseconds.
  - Trigger multiple actions with one text command and/or hotkey.
  - Let's be an expert in opening up the world instead of trying to put the whole world inside of Executor (as some alternatives try to do).
  - Take the clipboard to a new level, swiftly trigger system commands, do fast calculations, manage running applications and more.
  - Tailor keywords, appearance, hotkeys, and behavior to perfectly match your daily workflow.
  - Customize the look and feel with various skins and theming options to match your desktop setup.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  ### Improvements

  - Import/export dialog had a "redesign", adding a couple more buttons for bulk
    selection and rearranged some elements.
  - If clicking "cancel" in import/export dialog, the keyword editor will only be
    displayed afterwards if the dialog was started from the keyword editor.
  - You can now press Shift+F2 (most places) to end the Internal browser (when
    loaded) to unload it from memory. This is just like using the browserend
    keyword (based on the $BROWSEREND$ command).
  - The "Always align to the center of the screen" setting was previously limited
    to the primary display, it now has a lot of options. See Settings > General >
    "Auto center window".
  - Various settings adjustments and text updates, added various mouse over hints.
    Some settings have been rearranged for a more logical order.

  ### Fixes

  - Fixed an issue with external WebViews not being unloaded when closed.
  - Fixed an issue where a WebView could cause a "Cannot focus a disabled or
    invisible window." error message.
  - Fixed that focusing an external WebView would also recall Executor window when
    hidden.
  - Fixed a problem with some dialogs (like the permissions dialog) not being in
    foreground when the "Always on top" Window setting is enabled. Also renamed
    the "Always on top" Window setting to better reflect it's forceful/glitchy
    nature. It's not really recommended using this setting unless you have other
    apps blocking Executor from getting focus somehow.
