  ## Changelog
  This is a new minder client release.  Server releases are in the helm chart, which is published on each commit.

  Highlights of the client release include:

  **Improved CLI output**, including emoji for rule status (disable with `--emoji=false`) and more informative columns.  Here's a sample:
  ![458136843-77b657ed-dc4b-45e0-949d-311731b1109c](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32b20a26-d1be-4df0-83ff-f535f2ed78aa)

  **Reduced CLI noise** -- `minder` will automatically attempt to authenticate if your token is expired, rather than asking you to run `minder auth login` again.  Also, you should no longer receive a message amount no config file present after the first invocation, as `minder` will automatically create an empty config file in your home directory.
