ShortDescription: Backup tool for PC game saves
Moniker: ludusavi
ReleaseNotes: |-
  * Fixed:
    * Symlinks were incorrectly traversed when applying redirects.
      For example, if you had a backup-type redirect from `/old` to `/new`,
      but `/new` happened to be a symlink to `/newer` on your system,
      then the backup would incorrectly contain a reference to `/newer`.
    * Redirects could match a partial folder/file name.
      For example, a restore-type redirect from `C:/old` to `C:/new`
      would *also* redirect `C:/older` to `C:/newer` (`C:/[old -> new]er`).
    * On Linux, if a file name contained a colon (`:`),
      it would fail to back up.
    * GUI: When using a game's context menu to create a custom entry,
      Ludusavi did not scroll down to the new entry.
  * Changed:
    * Updated translations, including a new translation for Finnish.
