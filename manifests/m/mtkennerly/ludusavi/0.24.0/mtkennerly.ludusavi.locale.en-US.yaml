ShortDescription: Backup tool for PC game saves
Moniker: ludusavi
ReleaseNotes: |-
  * Added:
    * On the "other" screen,
      you can choose not to back up games with cloud support on certain stores.
      If a game is customized or already has local backups,
      then Ludusavi will continue backing it up regardless.
    * For Heroic roots, Ludusavi now supports Amazon and sideloaded games.
    * For Lutris roots,
      Ludusavi now scans `pga.db` in addition to `games/*.yml`
      in case the YAML files do not contain all of the necessary information.
    * CLI: There is a new `api` command that can be used for bulk queries.
      Right now, it only supports looking up titles (analogous to the `find` command).
    * CLI: There is a new `schema` command to display some of Ludusavi's schemas.
    * CLI: The `find` command now accepts a `--lutris-id` option.
    * CLI: The `backups` command output now includes each game's backup directory.
  * Changed:
    * Title normalization now ignores apostrophes and quotation marks
      (e.g., `ludusavi find --normalized "Mirrors Edge"` will find `Mirror's Edge`).
    * Some additional fields in the config file have been made optional.
    * Updated translations.
      (Thanks to contributors on the [Crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/ludusavi))
  * Fixed:
    * For Heroic and Lutris roots,
      if you had multiple copies of the same game,
      Ludusavi would only use the metadata from one of them.
    * GUI: The game-level duplication badge did not always fade out when the conflicts were resolved.
