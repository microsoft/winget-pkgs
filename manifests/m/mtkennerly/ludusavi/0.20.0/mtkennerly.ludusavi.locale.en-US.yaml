ShortDescription: Backup tool for PC game saves
Moniker: ludusavi
ReleaseNotes: |-
  * Added:
    * The restore screen now supports deselecting individual saves
      (like you already could on the backup screen).
    * You can now use glob syntax for file paths in the "backup exclusions" section.
    * CLI: Commands that take a list of games now support reading stdin (one game per line).
      For example, `ludusavi find --steam-id 504230 | ludusavi backup --preview`.
    * CLI: The `find` command will now report multiple results if you don't specify a name or ID.
      The command also has new options for filtering these results: `--disabled` and `--partial`.
      For example, `ludusavi find --restore --disabled` will list all games that can be restored and are disabled.
    * Support for checking secondary/associated Steam IDs for a game.
      This is mainly useful for discovering Proton prefix folders of DLC,
      since DLC saves may be kept separately from base game saves.
      Specifically, this detection is based on the `steamExtra` field from the manifest.
    * A "custom" badge is shown next to custom games in scan results.
    * Option to filter scan results by change status (new/updated/unchanged/unscanned).
      ([Contributed by kekonn](https://github.com/mtkennerly/ludusavi/pull/226))
    * For buttons that open a path selector dialog,
      shift+click will open the configured path in your file explorer.
  * Fixed:
    * When restoring registry saves,
      multi-string values would be restored as expandable string values,
      and expandable string values would be restored as multi-string values.
      This only affected the restore process; backups would still be correct.
      This issue was introduced in v0.18.0.
    * For Lutris roots, the `<base>` placeholder was resolved generically
      instead of using the Lutris-specific logic.
    * For Lutris roots, when inferring the `<base>` from the `exe` field,
      Ludusavi assumed that the path would be absolute, but it could also be relative.
      Now, Ludusavi will combine the `prefix` and `exe` fields if necessary.
  * Changed:
    * All path selectors now use the same icon.
    * The button to find missing roots now uses a search icon instead of a refresh icon.
    * Updated translations.
