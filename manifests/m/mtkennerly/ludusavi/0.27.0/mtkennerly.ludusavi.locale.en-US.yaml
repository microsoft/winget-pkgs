ShortDescription: Backup tool for PC game saves
Moniker: ludusavi
ReleaseNotes: |-
  * Added:
    * Support for installing via [cargo-binstall](https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall).
  * Changed:
    * Windows registry backups are now saved as `*.reg` files instead of `*.yaml`.
      Existing backups will not be affected.
    * On Linux, Ludusavi previously reported its application ID as just `ludusavi`,
      which meant the desktop file should be named `ludusavi.desktop` to show the right icon.
      However, that name does not follow the Freedesktop.org `desktop-entry` specification.

      To better conform, Ludusavi now reports its ID as `com.mtkennerly.ludusavi`
      (except for Flatpak, which will use `com.github.mtkennerly.ludusavi` for legacy reasons).
      If you need to preserve the original behavior,
      you can set `LUDUSAVI_LINUX_APP_ID=ludusavi` in your environment variables.

      ([Prototyped by OlegAckbar](https://github.com/mtkennerly/ludusavi/pull/417))
    * Dialogs (folder picker and `wrap --gui` prompts) now use GTK on Linux.
      The previous system relied on Zenity/KDialog,
      which could behave poorly depending on the version or in a Flatpak context.
    * The standalone Mac release is now compiled on Mac OS 13 instead of Mac OS 12
      because of [a change by GitHub](https://github.com/actions/runner-images/issues/10721).
    * Updated translations.
      (Thanks to contributors on the [Crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/ludusavi))
  * Fixed:
    * The registry format change also resolved an issue where very large (over 100 MB)
      `registry.yaml` files could be slow to read and consume a lot of extra memory,
      whereas the same data in `.reg` format can be loaded without issue.
    * When set to only keep 1 full backup and 0 differential backups using the simple format,
      Ludusavi keeps the existing backup in place and just adds/removes any changed files.
      However, after removing obsolete files, Ludusavi could leave empty directories behind.
      Now, Ludusavi will clean these up as well after creating a new backup for a game.
    * GUI: After a backup, if a file were removed,
      its change status wouldn't immediately refresh.
    * GUI: When performing a multi-game scan with a filter active,
      the visible games would be backed up or restored even if they were disabled.
    * GUI: When performing a multi-game scan on the restore screen with a filter active,
      the scan would exclude games that were disabled for backup rather than disabled for restore.
    * Ludusavi would try to scan games (custom or from secondary manifest) with a blank title.
      In the GUI, they would be omitted from the results,
      while on the CLI, they would be reported without a title.
      Now such games are ignored when scanning.
