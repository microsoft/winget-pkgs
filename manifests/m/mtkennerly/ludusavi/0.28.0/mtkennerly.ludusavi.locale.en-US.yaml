ShortDescription: Backup tool for PC game saves
Moniker: ludusavi
ReleaseNotes: |-
  * Added:
    * On Linux, for Lutris roots that point to a Flatpak installation,
      Ludusavi now checks `$XDG_DATA_HOME` and `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`
      inside of the Flatpak installation of Lutris.
    * Custom games now let you specify installed folder names.
      This can be used to satisfy the `<base>` and `<game>` path placeholders
      in cases where Ludusavi can't automatically detect the right folder.
    * On the "other" screen,
      there is a new option to skip backups when saves are only removed but not added/updated.
      This can be useful because uninstalling a game may cause some of its data (but not all) to be removed,
      but you may not want to exclude that data from your backups yet.
    * CLI: `config show` command.
    * CLI: The `backup`, `restore`, `cloud upload`, and `cloud download` commands
      now support a `--gui` option for graphical dialog prompts.
    * CLI: The `backup` and `restore` commands now support a `--dump-registry` option,
      which includes the serialized registry content in the output.
      This may be useful if you're consuming the `--api` output to back up with another tool,
      but don't have a good way to check the registry keys directly.
    * CLI: The `find` command now supports `--fuzzy` and `--multiple` options.
      This is also available for the `api` command's `findTitle` request.
    * CLI: The `wrap` command now supports several options from the `backup` command:
      `--path`,
      `--format`,
      `--compression`,
      `--compression-level`,
      `--full-limit`,
      `--differential-limit`,
      `--cloud-sync`,
      `--no-cloud-sync`.
  * Changed:
    * When the game list is filtered,
      the summary line (e.g., "1 of 10 games") now reflects the filtered totals.
    * The `enable/disable all` buttons are now constrained by the active filter.
    * GUI: Changed some icons to a softer version.
    * CLI: When using the `--gui` option of any command that supports it,
      errors at the end of the process will also be reported via dialogs.
      This does not apply to CLI parse errors.
    * Application crash and CLI parse errors are now logged.
    * Updated translations, including partial support for Vietnamese and Swedish.
      (Thanks to contributors on the [Crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/ludusavi))
  * Fixed:
    * If a custom game's title begins or ends with a space,
      that custom game will now be ignored.
      Previously, Ludusavi would make a backup folder for the game including the space,
      but the OS (namely Windows) would remove the space from the folder title,
      causing unpredictable behavior when Ludusavi couldn't find the expected folder name.
    * GUI: In backup mode, if Ludusavi failed to prepare the backup target folder,
      it would get stuck where you couldn't cancel/restart the operation.
    * CLI: `find --normalized` now better prioritizes the closest match
      when multiple manifest entries have the same normalized title.
    * Some default paths are now formatted more consistently.
    * GUI: There was an error when the backup/restore paths were relative to the working directory.
    * When backing up a read-only file using the simple format,
      Ludusavi would fail to set the backed up file's modified time.
