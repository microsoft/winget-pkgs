ShortDescription: Backup tool for PC game saves
Moniker: ludusavi
ReleaseNotes: |-
  * Fixed:
    * If two consecutive differential backups both ignored *different* save files
      *and* none of those files were ignored in the associated full backup,
      then the second differential backup would fail to redeclare
      the first differential backup's ignored saves.
    * If you redirected all of the saves for a game that already had a backup,
      then the next scan would list the game as new instead of updated.
    * GUI: On Mac, the file/folder selector would cause the app to crash.
