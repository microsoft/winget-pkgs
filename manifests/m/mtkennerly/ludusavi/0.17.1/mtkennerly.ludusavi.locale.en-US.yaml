ShortDescription: Backup tool for PC game saves
Moniker: ludusavi
ReleaseNotes: |-
  * Fixed:
    * As part of the thread configuration feature in v0.17.0,
      Ludusavi started defining a custom Tokio runtime initialization.
      However, this did not enable Tokio's IO and time features,
      resulting in a crash when attempting to display timed notifications.
    * When using the "customize" option from the scan list,
      the new custom game's fields were not filled in properly.
    * GUI: If a game was disabled,
      then the "back up" option in that game's "..." menu would not do anything.
    * GUI: If you scanned a few specific games in the list,
      but there were others in an unscanned state (recent games from a previous session),
      then the next full backup would only process the few games that were scanned.
