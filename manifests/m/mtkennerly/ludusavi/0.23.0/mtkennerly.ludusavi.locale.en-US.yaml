ShortDescription: Backup tool for PC game saves
Moniker: ludusavi
ReleaseNotes: |-
  * Added:
    * CLI: The `wrap` command now supports some new arguments:
      `--infer steam`, `--infer lutris`, and `--force` to skip confirmations
    * GUI: File sizes are now displayed for each file and directory.
      ([Contributed by JackSpagnoli](https://github.com/mtkennerly/ludusavi/pull/308))
    * When a save fails to back up or restore, you can now see a specific error message per save.
      Previously, this was only available in the log file.
      For the GUI, you can hover over the "failed" badge to view the error.
      Note that these errors are shown as-is for troubleshooting and may not be translated.
    * You can now set aliases to display instead of the original name.
      This does not affect the CLI when using `--api`.
    * On Linux, for Steam roots that point to a Flatpak installation,
      Ludusavi now checks `$XDG_DATA_HOME` and `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`
      inside of the Flatpak installation of Steam.
    * Updated translations, including new in-progress translations for Traditional Chinese and Turkish.
      (Thanks to contributors on the [Crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/ludusavi))
  * Fixed:
    * Ludusavi would crash when reading a non-UTF-8 mapping.yaml file.
      This wouldn't normally happen, but could arise from external modifications.
    * GUI: On Linux with Wayland, the app ID property was not being set,
      which caused some issues like not showing the window icon and not grouping the window properly.
      ([Contributed by ReillyBrogan](https://github.com/mtkennerly/ludusavi/pull/334))
    * CLI: During slow processing (e.g., cloud upload or a game with huge saves),
      the progress bar timer wouldn't update.
    * GUI: After performing a cloud upload preview on the other screen,
      the very next backup preview wouldn't do anything.
    * GUI: You can now use undo/redo shortcuts for backup comments.
    * CLI: The `wrap` command did not fail gracefully when the game launch commands were missing.
    * CLI: Several commands did not resolve aliases.
    * CLI: The `cloud` commands did not reject unknown game titles.
    * If a game had more data that failed to back up than succeeded,
      then the backup size would be reported incorrectly.
  * Changed:
    * The way Ludusavi parses file paths internally has been overhauled.
      The majority of the observable behavior is the same,
      but it is now more predictable and correct when parsing Linux-style paths on Windows and vice versa.

      Some behavioral changes worth noting:

      * You can now configure redirects that change Windows/Linux-style paths into the other format.
        For example, if you configure a backup redirect from `C:\games` to `/opt/games`,
        then the backup will contain references to `/opt/games`.
        (Previously, `/opt/games` would turn into `C:/opt/games` when parsed on Windows,
        and `C:\games` would turn into `./C_/games` when parsed on Linux.)
      * On Windows, you can no longer write `/games` as an alias of `C:\games`.
        These are now treated as distinct paths.
        (Previously, on Windows, Linux-style paths were interpreted as `C:` paths.)
      * If you try to restore Windows-style paths on Linux or vice versa,
        it will now produce an error,
        unless you've configured an applicable redirect.
    * GUI: On Windows, the way Ludusavi hides its console in GUI mode has changed,
      in order to avoid a new false positive from Windows Defender.

      Instead of relaunching itself, Ludusavi now detaches the console from the current instance.
      This reverts a change from v0.18.1,
      but care has been taken to address the problems that originally led to that change.
      If you do notice any issues related to this, please report them.
    * GUI: Previously, when you changed settings, Ludusavi would save each change immediately.
      It now waits for 1 second in case there is another change,
      so that typing and other fast, successive edits are batched.
    * CLI: Previously, the `restore` and `backups` (not `backup`) commands would return an error
      if you specified a game that did not have any backups available to restore.
      This was inconsistent with the `backup` command,
      which would simply return empty data if there was nothing to back up.
      Now, `restore` and `backups` will also return empty data if there are no backups.
    * CLI: Some deprecated flags have been removed from the `backup` command:
      `--merge`, `--no-merge`, `--update`, and `--try-update`.
    * When synchronizing to the cloud after a backup,
      Ludusavi now instructs Rclone to only check paths for games with updated saves.
      This improves the cloud sync performance.
    * The following are now configured as default arguments for Rclone:
      `--fast-list --ignore-checksum`.
      These should improve performance in most cases.
      You can change or remove these on the "other" screen.
    * GUI: During a backup or restore,
      if the "synchronize automatically" cloud setting is enabled,
      then the progress bar will display "cloud" instead of "scan" during the cloud operations.
    * Differential backup names now end with "-diff".
      This does not affect existing backups.
