ShortDescription: Backup tool for PC game saves
Moniker: ludusavi
ReleaseNotes: |-
  * Fixed:
    * Cloud backups would fail if the cloud path contained a backslash (`\`).
    * On Windows, if the default terminal application was the [Windows Terminal](https://aka.ms/terminal)
      (as opposed to the older Windows Console Host), then a couple of problems would happen
      when Ludusavi was launched from Windows Explorer:

      * An empty console window would stay open along with the GUI.
      * Asynchronous Rclone commands would fail.

      This was ultimately related to how Ludusavi hides the console in GUI mode.
      Now, instead of removing the console from the currently running instance,
      Ludusavi simply relaunches itself in a detached state.
