ShortDescription: Backup tool for PC game saves
Moniker: ludusavi
ReleaseNotes: |-
  * Added:
    * You can now configure game-specific Wine prefixes in a custom entry.
    * GUI: In the scan results, there is a button to copy registry key paths.
      On Windows, there is also a button to open the key in Regedit.
    * GUI: Backup comments may now contain multiple paragraphs.
    * CLI: `backups edit` command to update a backup's lock state and comment.
      The `api` command now also supports an `editBackup` request.
    * CLI: `config path` command to print the path to the active config file.
    * CLI: The `backup` and `restore` commands now have an `--include-disabled` option
      when you want to bulk process games that were disabled in the config.
    * CLI: Global `--debug` option to increase log level and open log folder after running.
      This is mainly to help users who are submitting bug reports.
    * CLI: The `backup`/`restore`/`wrap` commands now support an `--ask-downgrade` option.
      This is intended as a protection for cases such as when you launch games with `wrap` and `--force`,
      but if the backup didn't happen after your last session (e.g., your computer crashed),
      then on the next launch, an outdated backup would be restored.
    * CLI: `gui --custom-game Title` command to open a specific entry on the custom game screen.
  * Fixed:
    * The cloud "synchronize automatically" setting did not work in GUI mode,
      even though it did work correctly in CLI mode.
      This issue was introduced in v0.26.0.
      Please use the upload icon on the "other" screen to ensure your existing backups are synchronized.
  * Changed:
    * If the `WGPU_POWER_PREF` environment variable is not set,
      then Ludusavi will automatically set it to `high` while running.
      This has fixed application crashes on several users' systems,
      but is ultimately dependent on graphics hardware and drivers.
      If you experience any issues with this, please report it.
    * Updated translations, including partial support for Norwegian.
