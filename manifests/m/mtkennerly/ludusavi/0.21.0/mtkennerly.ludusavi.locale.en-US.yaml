ShortDescription: Backup tool for PC game saves
Moniker: ludusavi
ReleaseNotes: |-
  * Added:
    * GUI: Thanks to updates in [Iced](https://github.com/iced-rs/iced),
      there is now much better support for non-ASCII characters.
      This means that several translations are now properly supported:
      Simplified Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Thai.
      Unfortunately, there are still technical limitations with Arabic,
      so that translation remains experimental via the config file.
    * GUI: For custom games in scan results,
      you can click on the "custom" badge to jump to the corresponding entry.
  * Changed:
    * GUI: Rendering now uses DirectX/Vulkan/Metal instead of OpenGL.
      For systems that don't support those, there is a fallback software renderer as well.
    * GUI: Ludusavi now bundles and uses the Noto Sans font for consistency,
      but some languages will still depend on your system fonts.
  * Fixed:
    * If an invalid manifest file were downloaded, Ludusavi would correctly show an error,
      but then after relaunching, it would get stuck on an "updating manifest" screen.
    * On Linux, if Ludusavi were installed via Flatpak, then `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` and `XDG_DATA_HOME`
      would be set inside of the Flatpak environment, preventing it from finding some saves.
      Now, Ludusavi will also check the default paths (`~/.config` and `~/.local/share` respectively).
    * For Heroic roots, Ludusavi now also checks the `legendaryConfig` folder used by Heroic 1.9.0.
    * Saves associated with the Ubisoft Game Launcher folder were not detected
      on Linux when installed with Steam and Proton.
    * On non-Windows systems, when recursively finding files in a directory,
      file/folder names containing a backslash would cause an error.
      For now, these files will be ignored until they are properly supported.
    * When using shift+click on a path selector icon to browse the path,
      it will now handle some manifest `<placeholder>`s.
    * In paths, `<storeUserId>` next to `*` would trigger an error.
    * GUI: When switching screens and then expanding a section,
      the scroll position did not remain visually stable.
