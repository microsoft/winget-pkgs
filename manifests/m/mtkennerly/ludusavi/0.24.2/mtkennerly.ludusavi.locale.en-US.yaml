ShortDescription: Backup tool for PC game saves
Moniker: ludusavi
ReleaseNotes: |-
  * Fixed:
    * When multi-backup was enabled and Ludusavi backed up a game for the first time,
      it would first insert an empty backup in that game's `mapping.yaml`
      and then insert the real backup after.
      This behavior was meant for updating old backups from before multi-backup was added,
      but it was mistakenly being applied to brand new backups as well.

      Ludusavi will automatically detect and fix this.
      If the empty backup has a differential backup associated,
      then the oldest differential backup will replace the empty full backup.
      Otherwise, Ludusavi will remove the entry for the empty backup.

      **If you use Ludusavi's cloud sync feature,**
      please run a preview in restore mode,
      which will automatically fix any of these incorrect initial backups,
      and then perform a full cloud upload on the "other" screen.
    * For Lutris roots, after reading `pga.db`,
      Ludusavi did not properly combine that data with the data from the `games/*.yml` files.
      ([Verified by nihaals](https://github.com/mtkennerly/ludusavi/pull/359))
    * Ludusavi assumed that a Lutris root would contain both `games/` and `pga.db` together.
      That's true for new installations of Lutris,
      but older/existing installations would store them separately
      (e.g., `~/.config/lutris/games` and `~/.local/share/lutris/pga.db`).
      To fix this, you can now specify a different `pga.db` path explicitly.
      In some cases, Ludusavi can prompt you to update the root automatically.
    * CLI: The `find` command's `--steam-id` and `--gog-id` options
      only considered primary IDs from the manifest.
      They will now also consider secondary IDs (e.g., for DLC or different editions).
  * Changed:
    * Updated translations.
