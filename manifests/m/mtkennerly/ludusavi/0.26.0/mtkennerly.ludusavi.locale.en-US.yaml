ShortDescription: Backup tool for PC game saves
Moniker: ludusavi
ReleaseNotes: |-
  * Added:
    * Paths may now use the `<storeGameId>` placeholder.
      This is supported in Steam, GOG, and Lutris roots.
      For Steam roots, this also supports shortcuts to non-Steam games,
      where the placeholder will map to the shortcut's dynamic app ID.
    * Paths may now use the `<winLocalAppDataLow>` placeholder.
    * GUI: On the backup and restore screens,
      if you activate the filter options,
      then the backup/restore buttons will only process the currently listed games.
      This allows you to quickly scan a specific subset of games.
    * You can now choose whether a custom game will override or extend
      a manifest entry with the same name.
      Previously, it would always override the manifest entry completely.
    * GUI: Custom games can now be expanded/collapsed, sorted, and filtered.
    * GUI: Custom games now have an icon to indicate when they override/extend a manifest entry.
    * You can now configure redirects to be processed in reverse sequence when restoring.
    * GUI: On the custom games screen,
      when you use the button to preview a custom game,
      the window will switch to the backup screen and show you the results for that game.
    * GUI: There is now a button to quickly reset the game list filters,
      while still leaving the filter options open.
  * Fixed:
    * Files on Windows network shares were not backed up correctly.
      For example, a file identified as `\\localhost\share\test.txt`
      would be backed up as `<game>/drive-____UNC_localhost_share_test.txt`
      instead of the intended `<game>/drive-____UNC_localhost_share/test.txt`.
    * When Steam was not installed, the logs would contain a `warning`-level message.
      This has been demoted to an `info`-level message.
    * GUI: Fixed some inconsistent spacing between elements.
    * CLI: On Linux, the `wrap` command's `--infer steam` option would fail
      to find the `SteamAppId` environment variable due to a case mismatch.
    * CLI: In some error conditions, the `wrap` command would show an alert
      and wait for the user to press a key, even if `--force` was specified.
      Now, with `--force`, Ludusavi will not wait for any input.
    * Old log files were not deleted when stored on a Windows network share.
    * GUI: The title filter was case-sensitive.
  * Changed:
    * GUI: After successfully backing up or restoring a game,
      the status icons (new/updated/etc) will be cleared for that game.
    * GUI: If the GUI fails to load, Ludusavi will try to log the error info.
    * GUI: When you launch Ludusavi, the window now ensures that it gains focus.
    * GUI: Modals now display on top of the app with a transparent background.
    * GUI: On the backup and restore screens,
      the filter controls now wrap depending on the window size.
    * GUI: The backup format and retention settings are now on the "other" screen,
      instead of being accessed via the gear icon on the backup screen.
    * GUI: Some uses of "select"/"deselect" have been changed to "enable"/"disable".
    * GUI: The game list filters now have a different background color.
    * Updated translations.
