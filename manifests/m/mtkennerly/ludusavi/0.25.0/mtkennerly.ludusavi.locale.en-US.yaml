ShortDescription: Backup tool for PC game saves
Moniker: ludusavi
ReleaseNotes: |-
  * Added:
    * You can now ignore specific manifests during scans.
      For example, if you only want to back up custom games,
      you can now disable the primary manifest's entries.
    * GUI: On startup and once every 24 hours,
      Ludusavi will check if a new version is available and notify you.
    * GUI: When left open,
      Ludusavi will automatically check for manifest updates once every 24 hours.
      Previously, this check only occurred when the app started.
    * Manifests may now include a `notes` field.
      If a game has notes in the manifest,
      then the backup screen will show an info icon next to the game,
      and you can click the icon to display the notes.
      The primary manifest does not (yet) contain any notes,
      so this mainly applies to secondary manifest authors.
    * GUI: You can now filter scan results by which secondary manifest defined each game.
      You can also filter to display custom games only.
    * CLI: The `api` command now supports a `checkAppUpdate` message.
    * Linux: Added keywords to the `.desktop` file.

  * Fixed:
    * CLI: Some commands would fail with relative path arguments.
  * Changed:
    * In the config file, `manifest.url` is now set to `null` by default
      to indicate that the default URL should be used,
      rather than explicitly putting the default URL in the file.
    * Updated translations.
