ShortDescription: Dynamic multi-multimedia player
Moniker: madamiru
ReleaseNotes: |-
  * Added:
    * There is now a "synchronize" toggle (link icon in the top bar),
      which synchronizes play/pause/seek events for all media of the same category
      (image, audio, video).
    * Each grid now has an icon to view the available media for its configured sources.
    * Several actions now have keyboard shortcuts.
    * You can cycle through grids or individual players with the tab key
      and then use keyboard controls on that selection.
  * Changed:
    * In the top bar, the playlist actions are now grouped together in a submenu.
  * Fixed:
    * Glob sources did not load correctly.
      This was related to v0.2.1's incremental media loading behavior.
    * CLI: When a source was specified, you had to click "add player" for media to start playing.
    * If you tried to add another player when no more media was available,
      the playlist would still be marked as having unsaved changes.
    * If you tried to load an invalid playlist,
      the original playlist would no longer be marked as having unsaved changes.
