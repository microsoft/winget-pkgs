ShortDescription: Dynamic multi-multimedia player
Moniker: madamiru
ReleaseNotes: |-
  * Fixed:
    * When loading a playlist,
      the application would wait until all sources were scanned before playing any media,
      which could take a while for large collections or slow network folders.
      Now, it will play media as each file is scanned.
  * Changed:
    * If the `WGPU_POWER_PREF` environment variable is not set,
      then Madamiru will automatically set it to `high` while running.
      This has fixed application crashes on several users' systems,
      but is ultimately dependent on graphics hardware and drivers.
      If you experience any issues with this, please report it.
    * The standalone Linux release is now compiled on Ubuntu 22.04 instead of Ubuntu 20.04
      because of [a change by GitHub](https://github.com/actions/runner-images/issues/11101).
    * Previously, when loading a playlist,
      if there weren't enough media to fill all of the configured grid slots,
      the application would automatically remove slots that it couldn't fill.
      However, now that slots are filled one-by-one in case the media scan is slow,
      we don't know right away if there's enough valid media to fill all slots.
      Therefore, empty slots will now stay on the grid,
      and you can either remove them manually or reconfigure your sources.
    * Updated translations.
