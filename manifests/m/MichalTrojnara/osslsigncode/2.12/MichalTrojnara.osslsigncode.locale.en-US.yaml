  CRITICAL SECURITY VULNERABILITY
  This release fixes a critical memory corruption vulnerability. A malicious
  attacker could create a signed file, which, when verified with osslsigncode,
  triggers arbitrary code execution. Any previous version of osslsigncode should
  be immediately upgraded if the tool is used for verification of untrusted
  files.
  - fixed a buffer overflow while extracting message digests
    (reported and fixed by Antoni Klajn, Opera)
