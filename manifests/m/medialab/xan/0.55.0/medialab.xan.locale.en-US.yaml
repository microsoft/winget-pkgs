ShortDescription: The CSV magician
Description: |-
  xan is a command line tool that can be used to process CSV files directly from the shell.
  It has been written in Rust to be as fast as possible, use as little memory as possible, and can very easily handle large CSV files (Gigabytes). It leverages a novel SIMD CSV parser and is also able to parallelize some computations (through multithreading) to make some tasks complete as fast as your computer can allow.
  It can easily preview, filter, slice, aggregate, sort, join CSV files, and exposes a large collection of composable commands that can be chained together to perform a wide variety of typical tasks.
  xan also offers its own expression language so you can perform complex tasks that cannot be done by relying on the simplest commands. This minimalistic language has been tailored for CSV data and is way faster than evaluating typical dynamically-typed languages such as Python, Lua, JavaScript etc.
  Note that this tool is originally a fork of BurntSushi's xsv, but has been nearly entirely rewritten at that point, to fit SciencesPo's médialab use-cases, rooted in web data collection and analysis geared towards social sciences (you might think CSV is outdated by now, but read our love letter to the format before judging too quickly).
  xan therefore goes beyond typical data manipulation and expose utilities related to lexicometry, graph theory and even scraping.
  Beyond CSV data, xan is able to process a large variety of CSV-adjacent data formats from many different disciplines such as web archival (.cdx) or bioinformatics (.vcf, .gtf, .sam, .bed etc.). xan is also able to convert to & from many data formats such as json, excel files, numpy arrays etc. using xan to and xan from. See this section for more detail.
  Finally, xan can be used to display CSV files in the terminal, for easy exploration, and can even be used to draw basic data visualisations.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Breaking
  - Changing how xan separate generates default column names.
  - xan from -f=(json|ndjson|jsonl) will now emit column in input order by default.
  - Changing xan to -B/--buffer-size to --sample-size to harmonize flag names with xan from.
  Features
  - Adding the xan complete command.
  - Adding an optional unit to ceil, floor, round & trunc moonblade function. E.g. floor to nearest decade: floor(year, 10).
  - Adding basename & dirname moonblade functions.
  - Adding parse_py_literal moonblade functions. Useful to deal with files dubiously serialized using pandas.
  - Adding xan view --repeat-headers=(auto|always|never).
  - Adding xan view --reveal-whitespace=(auto|always|never).
  - Adding --color support to XAN_VIEW_ARGS.
  - Adding xan from -f json --sample-size -1 to sample the whole file.
  - Adding xan from -f json --single-object.
  - Adding xan from --sort-keys.
  - Adding xan to (json|ndjson|jsonl) --sample-size -1 to sample the whole file.
  - Adding xan to (json|ndjson|jsonl) --strings flag.
  - Adding xan separate --prefix.
  - Adding xan heatmap -C short flag for --cram.
  - Adding xan heatmap --repeat-headers.
  - Adding rank, cume_dist, percent_rank and ntile window functions.
  - Adding xan help --color.
  Fixes
  - Fixing xan select -ne incorrectly emitting headers.
  Quality of Life
  - xan view -p will not print bottom header anymore by default.
  - xan view will not reveal problematic whitespace if output is not colored anymore, by default.
  - Better xan hist error messages and help.
  - Testing more file name variants when searching for a .gzi index.
