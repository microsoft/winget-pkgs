ShortDescription: The CSV magician
Description: |-
  xan is a command line tool that can be used to process CSV files directly from the shell.
  It has been written in Rust to be as fast as possible, use as little memory as possible, and can very easily handle large CSV files (Gigabytes). It leverages a novel SIMD CSV parser and is also able to parallelize some computations (through multithreading) to make some tasks complete as fast as your computer can allow.
  It can easily preview, filter, slice, aggregate, sort, join CSV files, and exposes a large collection of composable commands that can be chained together to perform a wide variety of typical tasks.
  xan also offers its own expression language so you can perform complex tasks that cannot be done by relying on the simplest commands. This minimalistic language has been tailored for CSV data and is way faster than evaluating typical dynamically-typed languages such as Python, Lua, JavaScript etc.
  Note that this tool is originally a fork of BurntSushi's xsv, but has been nearly entirely rewritten at that point, to fit SciencesPo's médialab use-cases, rooted in web data collection and analysis geared towards social sciences (you might think CSV is outdated by now, but read our love letter to the format before judging too quickly).
  xan therefore goes beyond typical data manipulation and expose utilities related to lexicometry, graph theory and even scraping.
  Beyond CSV data, xan is able to process a large variety of CSV-adjacent data formats from many different disciplines such as web archival (.cdx) or bioinformatics (.vcf, .gtf, .sam, .bed etc.). xan is also able to convert to & from many data formats such as json, excel files, numpy arrays etc. using xan to and xan from. See this section for more detail.
  Finally, xan can be used to display CSV files in the terminal, for easy exploration, and can even be used to draw basic data visualisations.
