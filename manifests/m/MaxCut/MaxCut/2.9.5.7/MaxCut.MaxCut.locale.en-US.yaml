ReleaseNotes: |-
  New Features
  - Improved Grooving Dialog
    - Grooving just got more flexible! You can now define both a start and end groove, allowing grooves to be placed away from the panel edge.
    - Grooving paths can now begin before the edge or extend beyond the end of a panel, giving you precise control over groove placement.
  - Send to Machine Button
    - A new Send to Machine button has been added to help streamline CNC export and feedback.
    - This opens the CNC export options for DXF, and includes an option to share more details about your machine setup or integration needs, helping guide future CNC integration development.

  - Keyboard Shortcuts Reference
    - You can now easily access all keyboard shortcuts via Help > View Keyboard Shortcuts.
    - A printable Keyboard Shortcuts Report is also available, making it simple to keep a handy reference nearby.
  Updates
  - Improved Grain Match Group Behavior
    - When adding an ungrouped panel to an existing grain match group, the newly added panel is now automatically selected for easier placement and alignment.

  - Experimental Mode Banner
    - It’s now easier to tell when you’re running MaxCut in experimental mode. A green banner appears across the top of the application.
    - The banner includes a link to learn more about experimental features and a shortcut to settings where you can toggle experimental mode on or off.

  - Improved Add New Experience
    - We’ve added new keyboard shortcuts (Alt+Enter and Shift+Enter) to give you more flexibility based on your workflow or keyboard preference.
    - The familiar Insert key still works as before, but now you can use the shortcut that feels most natural for you.

  - Improved Grain Match Navigation When Strips Are Removed
    - Editing grain-matched panels is now more intuitive: layouts update dynamically as you move panels, and unnecessary strips are automatically skipped.
    - This makes organizing and adjusting complex grain layouts smoother and more predictable.
  Fixes
  - Crash When Printing Job Layout with Feet – Precision 32
    - Printing Job Layouts with the measurement system set to Feet – Precision 32 no longer causes a crash.
    - Job Layouts now print correctly across all measurement systems and materials.
