ReleaseNotes: |-
  Updates
  - Grain Match – Improved Duplication Workflow
    - When duplicating an item that belongs to a grain match group, you’ll now be prompted whether to copy the group as well.
    - If you choose to keep the group, the grain match dialog opens, and the copied panels are automatically shifted to the end of their rows to prevent overlapping.

  - Grain Match – Arrow Indicators
    - Added arrow controls in the grain match preview to let you move selected panels more easily.

  - Regional Settings Visibility
    - You can now quickly view your Windows regional settings directly in the Currency Settings menu.
    - This makes it easier to confirm symbols (e.g., for CSV imports) when troubleshooting or debugging.
  Fixes
  - Grain Match – Move Right Arrow
    - The “move right” arrow is now correctly disabled when the panel cannot be moved further.

  - Panel Item List Report – Holes and Grooving
    - The Panel Item List report now displays holes and grooving details in the correct columns.
