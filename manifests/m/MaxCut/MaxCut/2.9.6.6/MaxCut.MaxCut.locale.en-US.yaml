  Updates
  - Beta Optimization Engine Improvements
    - The results of the Beta Optimization Engine have been improved to further reduce material wastage. The algorithm is now more efficient, delivering tighter layouts and better material utilization.
  - Easy Access to "Edit Sheet Material" on Optimized Sheets
  ◦ The "Edit Sheet Material" option has been added to the context menu when right-clicking panels on the optimization layout.
  ◦ Positioned below the existing panel options, this ensures sheet-related actions are always accessible without requiring you to enter the Materials Manager. This makes the editing experience more intuitive and consistent.
  Fixes
  - Handling of Invalid Language Settings
  ◦ MaxCut now safely handles invalid language settings during startup.
  ◦ Users are prompted to re-select their preferred language, ensuring the application opens successfully without errors.
  - Accurate Hole Scaling in DXF Exports
  ◦ Hole geometry in DXF exports (for both cut lines and panels) now scales accurately across all measurement types.
  ◦ Holes are sized and positioned correctly relative to the panel edges, ensuring precise exports for production.
