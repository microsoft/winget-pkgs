ReleaseNotes: |-
  New Features
  - Experimental Features Toggle
    - Added a setting that lets users opt into experimental features that are almost ready for public release.

    - You’ll need to restart MaxCut for the changes to take effect.
  Updates
  - Nested Groups in Input Item Group List Report
    - Improved handling of nested groups so they now appear within the group hierarchy.
    - Example: Instead of showing each shelf as its own group, nested shelves will now display under the main item, making the report more intuitive.
  - Input Item Editing
    - Pressing ENTER on an input item will now trigger editing the selected item rather than adding a new item.
  - Job Resources Summary Report
    - Renamed the Job Costing Summary (User Settings View) to Job Resources Summary for clarity.
    - Export button on the Summary tab now directly triggers CSV export of this report.
    - CSV export updated to include totals for Cost, Sub Total, Tax 1, Tax 2, Profit, and Grand Total.
  - Business Edition Feature Access
    - Adjusted feature limitations to allow Community Edition (CE) users to experience more Business Edition (BE) features, instead of being completely restricted.
  Fixes
  - Optimization Error Handling
    - Added validation for extremely large values in cost and pricing fields when managing materials, preventing errors during optimization.
    - This improvement ensures smoother material imports and reduces the chance of crashes caused by unusual data.
    - Users will now see clearer messages if unexpected values are detected, making it easier to spot and fix formatting issues early.
  - Selected Material Summary
    - The Selected Material Summary now displays correctly in the Optimized Sheets tab, giving users clearer visibility of chosen materials during optimization.
  - Sheet Materials Import
    - MaxCut now automatically detects and handles whether the first row of a sheet materials file should be excluded, removing the need for manual settings and making imports more reliable.
