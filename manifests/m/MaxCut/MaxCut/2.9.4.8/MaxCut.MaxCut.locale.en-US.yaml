  Updates
  - Faster Input Item Actions
    We’ve significantly improved the speed and responsiveness of working with input items—actions like selecting, cutting, deleting, pasting, duplicating, importing, grouping, ungrouping, and moving items are now much faster, making your workflow smoother and more efficient.
