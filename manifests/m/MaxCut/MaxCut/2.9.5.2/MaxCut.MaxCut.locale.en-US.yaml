ReleaseNotes: |-
  New Features
  - Match Grain Feature (Beta)
    Now available for beta testing, the Match Grain feature lets you group panels so the grain runs continuously across them during optimization, giving you greater control over grain direction and visual consistency.
  - Edging Totals in Optimization View
    You can now view edging totals directly from the Optimization Screen Legend for a clearer overview during planning.
  - Exclude Input Items on Optimization
    A new control allows you to exclude specific input items:
    - Ignored by the optimizer and costing
    - Visually marked as inactive
    - Shows a warning on the summary and optimization screen
  Updates
  - Setup Wizard Menu Option
    Added a Setup Wizard to the Settings menubar option, making it easier to revisit the initial setup experience.
  - Cleaned up Toolbar & UI Simplification
  - 3rd Party MIT License Inclusion
    We now bundle MIT licenses for all 3rd party packages used, ensuring compliance with open-source licensing requirements.
  Fixes
  - Installer .NET Framework Detection
    The installer correctly identifies if the .NET Framework is present and runs without false errors.
  - Optimized Layouts Focus
    After optimizing, the interface now focuses correctly on optimized layouts instead of the export button.
  - Crowdin Licensing Strings
    Added license-related UI strings to Crowdin for localization.
  - Backup Restore Crash on Read-Only Settings File
    Restoring a backup now handles read-only Settings.xml files with a more meaningful error message:
    “Access to the file {full path}\Settings.xml is denied for user XYZ. MaxCut requires access to this file to restore a backup. Please adjust file permissions and try again. Restore aborted!”
  - Material Selector Memory Optimization
    Resolved an out-of-memory error in the material selector:
    - Large images are now compressed on upload
    - Separate thumbnail and preview sizes are used
    - Upgrade logic transforms existing user images on first run after update
  - Grooving Preview Locale Bug
    Fixed grooving preview failure for users using commas as decimal separators. Preview now correctly interprets decimal formats based on Windows regional settings.
