  New Features
  - Added Avery 45008 Label Format
    MaxCut now includes a dedicated label report for the Avery 45008 template—commonly used in the United States and Canada. This format supports 21 labels per US Letter sheet (3 columns × 7 rows), with dimensions of 71.44 × 38.1 mm. It mirrors the layout used in our A4 24-label report, allowing all familiar details to fit comfortably while aligning with North American labeling standards.
  Fixes
  - Crash-Free DXF Export
    Exporting to DXF works without crashing when the last-used save path is unavailable. Exports now fail gracefully with a prompt if the destination path is invalid.

  - Mass Change Dialog Stability
    Pressing Esc or clicking Cancel inside a Mass Change option now correctly closes only the inner dialog—no more unintentionally closing the entire Mass Change window.

  - Batch Print Accuracy for A4 and Letter Labels
    Batch print labels on A4 or Letter layouts now consistently display all data across multiple pages, avoiding blank outputs after the first page.

  - Job Summary Edging Calculation
    The Job Summary report accurately reflects edging quantities from input item edging, ensuring your reports align perfectly with actual project requirements.
