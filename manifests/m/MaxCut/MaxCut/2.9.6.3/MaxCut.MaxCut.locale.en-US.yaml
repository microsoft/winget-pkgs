ReleaseNotes: |-
  Fixes
  - Exception when group quantity is set to 0
    An exception could occur if a group’s quantity was set to 0, a workaround some users use to temporarily exclude items from the optimisation.
    Groups with a quantity of 0 are now safely ignored during optimisation and no longer trigger an error message.
  This improves stability and preserves existing workflows that rely on this exclusion method.
