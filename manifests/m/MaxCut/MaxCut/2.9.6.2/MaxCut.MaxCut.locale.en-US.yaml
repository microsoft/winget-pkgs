  New Features
  Unique panel numbering across jobs, reports, and labels
  - Each panel in a job is now assigned a unique panel number (for example #1, #2) when it’s created.
  - This identifier is consistently shown across:
    - Input Item List
    - On-screen optimization layouts
    - Optimization layout reports
    - Label reports
    - Cutting list reports
  - Panels with quantities greater than one receive one unique ID per panel, and repeated panels in layouts correctly link to multiple IDs.
  - The panel number’s visibility and placement are configurable:
    - It can be hidden entirely
    - Shown before the panel name or symbol
    - Shown after the panel name or symbol
  - A new setting, “Show unique panel number”, has been added under Settings > Layout > Panel Labelling:
    - Enabled by default for new users
    - Disabled by default for existing users (to avoid unexpected label changes)
  - This improves traceability across layouts, reports, and labels, reduces labeling errors, and makes it easier to match panels during cutting and assembly.

  Updates
  - New material CSV import option for sub size usage
    - A new column, Material Sub Size Usage, can now be specified when importing materials:
      - 0 = Use any number of sub sizes
      - 1 = Use only for the last sheet
    - Import behavior is now smarter and safer:
      - Existing materials keep their current sub size setting if the column is not provided
      - If the column is provided, the imported value is applied
      - New materials without the column continue using the existing default behavior

  Fixes
  - Label “Sheet X of Y” now matches material sheet count
    - Labels previously showed Y as the total number of sheets in the job, which could be misleading.
    - Labels now correctly display Y as the total number of sheets for the specific material used by that panel.
    - This ensures labels align with the optimization layout and makes it easier to identify the correct sheet during production.
  - Successful exports for material names with illegal Windows characters
    - Materials containing characters like \ / : * ? " < > | previously failed to export PNG or DXF files.
    - These exports now handle such names correctly, preventing the error message:
      - "Error Exporting: Illegal characters in path"
    - This improves reliability when working with externally sourced or legacy material names.
  - Label print order now matches the optimization diagram
    - Labels are now printed in the same order they appear in the optimization layout.
    - This makes it significantly easier to match printed labels to panels during cutting and labeling, reducing mistakes and workflow friction.
