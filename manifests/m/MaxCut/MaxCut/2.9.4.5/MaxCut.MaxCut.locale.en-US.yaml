  New Features
  - Import Input Items from Excel (.xlsx format) – You can now import input items directly from Excel, making data entry faster and more seamless.

  Updates
  - Improved Panel Selection in Optimization View
    - Left-clicking on the expanded part of a panel now also selects the panel.
    - Right-clicking on the expanded part of a panel now brings up the same context menu as clicking directly on the panel.

  - Enhanced KD Max Import Handling for Panel Thickness
    - To reduce errors when selecting a material during import, MaxCut now:
      1. Attempts to find a material that matches the material name (from the import).
      2. If no exact match is found, it looks for a material matching name - thickness mm.
      3. If there is still no match, the user will be prompted to select a replacement.

        Example:
        - Imported Name: White Example Board
        - Imported Thickness: 18 mm
        - MaxCut will match against:
          - White Example Board
          - White Example Board - 18 mm

  - Smoother Downgrade Experience to Community Edition
    - If your MaxCut downgrades from Business Edition to Community Edition (for whatever reason), we've improved the process to make it easier to get back up and running.
    - A clearer dialog box now guides you through the steps:
      - Step 1: Reactivate your subscription (Green button)
      - Step 2: Check your subscription status (New button)
