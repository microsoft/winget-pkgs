  - In windowed mode on the Raspberry Pi, video does not move in sync with the window when dragged.
    This is a limitation of MMAL video overlays.
  - In windowed mode on the Raspberry Pi, video will not display while the app does not have focus.
    This is required to prevent Moonlight's video overlay from rendering on top of other apps.
