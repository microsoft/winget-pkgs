ReleaseNotes: |-
  MuseScore Studio 4.6.2 is now available!
  This update includes critical fixes to improve app stability and performance.
  This release restores compatibility with macOS 10.15 and 11, which was lost in 4.6 when we updated to Qt 6.9.2. We've now patched Qt to maintain compatibility with those versions as well as the very latest macOS Tahoe 26.
  For more details, please see https://musescore.org/en/4.6.2.
