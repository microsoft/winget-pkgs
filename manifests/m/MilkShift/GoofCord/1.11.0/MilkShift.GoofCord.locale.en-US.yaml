ReleaseNotes: |-
  ‚ö†Ô∏è Cloud backup encryption upgrade (BREAKING)
  The previous encryption system for cloud settings was susceptible to brute force and integrity attacks. This update addresses this by hardening encryption, following OWASP and NIST recommendations.
  - What you need to do: If you use a password with the cloud backup feature, you must re-save your settings after updating.
  - What will happen: Old, password-protected cloud backups will no longer be loadable after this update.
  Note: This vulnerability was only a risk for users storing message encryption passwords on cloud with a weak password.
  ‚ú®Ô∏è Functionality changes
  - üêß Wayland By Default: Now runs in Wayland mode by default on Linux (when XDG_SESSION_TYPE=wayland is set) ‚Äî no manual Ozone platform flags needed
  - üî¥ More Accurate Unread Counts: Badges for the dynamic icon are now generated during runtime, which allows showing precise ping counts up to 99 on the app icon.
  - "Unread badge" setting: Show a dot on the app icon if you have any unreads.
  - "Static title" setting: Prevent Discord from changing the window title.
  - Hidden disableGpuCompositing setting: Sets the --disable-gpu-compositing flag. Some users find it improves screen share quality. Access by triple-clicking "Other" category.
  üêõ Fixes
  - Settings buttons no longer switch to first tab unexpectedly.
  - Fixed laggy scrolling in channels with many reactions.
  - Fixed settings not loading if safeStorage decryption fails.
  Other/small changes
  - Translation updates in #138
  - UX improvements to the cloud system
  - Added margin to the wordmark
  - Removed GTK 4 crash workaround
  - Use in-built compile cache instead of "v8-compile-cache"
  - Updated to Electron 38.2.2
