ReleaseNotes: |-
  This is a small patch that mostly fixes the broken custom titlebar while I am working on a bigger update. It is built from the 1.11.4 branch, and not the main branch.
  ✨️ Functionality changes
  - Added a cozy winter theme for the settings. It can be disabled with a setting in the "Appearance" category.
  - Added a setting to disable hardware acceleration.
  🐛 Fixes
  - Fixed the custom titlebar. If you were using a workaround from #160, you can delete it now.
  Full Changelog: v1.11.3...1.11.4
