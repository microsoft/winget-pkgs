ReleaseNotes: |-
  ✨️ Functionality changes
  - Added a setting to change the UserAgent. This can be used to bypass VPN blocking on Linux by setting a Windows user agent. It will likely make your traffic suspicious. A better workaround will be made when I have the time. #137
  🐛 Fixes
  - Updated SpikeHD's shelter plugin links, which fixed ShelteRPC not installing for new users.
  - Fixed shortcuts not working on Linux when the same keybind is assigned in Discord and in a shortcut manager like KDE shortcuts #144
  Other/small changes
  - Disabled DevTools detection by default
  - Updated to Electron 39.2.3
