ReleaseNotes: |-
  This release includes massive internal changes and may not guarantee a clean migration.
  Your list of client mods will be reset.
  ✨️ Functionality changes
  - 🚸 Migration to Vencord: GoofCord now fully uses Vencord/Equicord for internal Discord interactions instead of Shelter. This eliminates the need to always load 2 client mods. If you weren't using any custom plugins in Shelter, it is safe to remove it.
  - 🧩 Asset Downloader: There is now a generic asset downloader that you can use to install themes or custom client mods. Learn more here
  - 🚀 Faster Startup: Cut startup times in half for subsequent runs.
  - ⚙️ Fancier settings: Various settings UI improvements, like proper lists and smoother animations.
  - Various improvements to arRPC.
  - Enabled process sandboxing.
  🐛 Fixes
  - Fixed Vencord QuickCSS not loading
  - Fixed stream quality being shown as 720p 30fps
  - Fixed keybinds menu not being accessible
  - ...a bunch of other fixes
  Other changes
  - Ginormous internal refactoring
  - Ensured strict type safety
