ReleaseNotes: |-
  ‚ú®Ô∏è Functionality changes
  - Global Keybinds: You can now set keybinds in the Discord settings, and they will work globally across the system.
    - This is implemented using venbind, which currently only supports Windows and Linux on x64 architectures.
    - If you are on Linux and your desktop environment does not support the GlobalShortcuts portal, you can manually bind your desired keybinds to CLI triggers: --keybind-up="<keybind id>", --keybind-down="<keybind id>" . You can get the id by opening DevTools (Ctrl+Shift+I), going to Console tab and modifying/adding a keybind. You should see an Array in the console which contains registered keybind ids. This process is temporary and will be improved in future versions.
    - --no-venbind argument stops venbind from loading
  üêõ Fixes
  - Fixed Shop/Discovery freezing ("Opening Discord app..."). Requires Rich Presence to be enabled.
  - Fixed CSS @import not working with Asset Loader
  Other/small changes
  - Updated to Electron 35.1.5
  - Improved channel selector scrolling performance
