ReleaseNotes: |-
  ✨️ Functionality changes
  - Windows Spoofing: Added a setting to realistically emulate the Windows platform. This effectively bypasses VPN blocking on Linux #137, while hopefully being less suspicious. If you were using a custom user agent for this purpose, use this instead. (by @Error-Cezar in #150)
  - Updated screen sharing framerate and resolution inputs to be selectors instead of text fields (by @Error-Cezar in #152)
  Other/small changes
  - Translation updates #151
