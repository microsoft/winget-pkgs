ReleaseNotes: |-
  ✨️ Functionality changes
  - Added "Performance flags" option. If you were running with --no-flags to work around issues, disabling performance flags should be enough now.
  - Added rich presence support for macOS
  - Made Windows game scanning faster
  Other/small changes
  - Some assets, like localization, are now "baked" into the JS bundle, reducing file system calls. Potentially improves startup times on slow storage devices.
  - Updated to Electron 37.2.6
