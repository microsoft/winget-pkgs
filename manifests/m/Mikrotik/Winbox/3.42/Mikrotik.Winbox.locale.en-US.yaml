ShortDescription: Small utility that allows administration of MikroTik RouterOS using a fast and simple GUI.
Description: |-
  WinBox is a small utility that allows the administration of MikroTik RouterOS using a fast and simple GUI. It is a native Win32/Win64 binary but can be run on Linux and macOS (OSX) using Wine. All WinBox interface functions are as close as possible mirroring the console functions, that is why there are no WinBox sections in the manual. Some advanced and system critical configurations are not possible from the WinBox, like MAC address change on an interface.

  From WinBox v3.14, the following security features are used:
  - WinBox.exe is signed with an Extended Validation certificate, issued by SIA MikrotÄ«kls (MikroTik).
  - WinBox uses ECSRP for key exchange and authentication (requires a new WinBox version).
  - Both sides verify that the other side knows the password (no man in the middle attack is possible).
  - WinBox in RoMON mode requires that the agent is the latest version to be able to connect to the latest version routers.
  - WinBox uses AES128-CBC-SHA as an encryption algorithm (requires WinBox version 3.14 or above).
