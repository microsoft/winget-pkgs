ShortDescription: Audio loudness analyzer and gain adjustment tool for mastering and DJ workflows
Description: |-
  headroom simulates the behavior of Rekordbox's Auto Gain feature, but with a key difference:
  it identifies files with available headroom (True Peak below the target ceiling) and applies
  gain adjustment without using a limiter.

  This tool is designed for DJs and producers who want to maximize loudness while preserving
  dynamics, ensuring tracks hit the optimal True Peak ceiling without clipping.
