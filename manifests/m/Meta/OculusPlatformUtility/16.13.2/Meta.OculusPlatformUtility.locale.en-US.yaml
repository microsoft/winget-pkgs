Description: The Oculus platform utility is a command-line tool that enables you upload builds to your release channels much faster than using the developer dashboard web interface, and it enables larger upload packages. It also allows you to incorporate automated uploads into your existing build system. The Oculus platform utility uploads builds faster because it analyzes your build and only uploads the parts that have changed since your last upload.
