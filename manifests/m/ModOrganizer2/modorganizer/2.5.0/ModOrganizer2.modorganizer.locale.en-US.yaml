  Caveats
  - Plugin management is only possible by using the Plugins.txt Enabler mod.
    This can be loaded either with SFSE or an ASI loader.
    If you use the ASI loader you may want to disable this check.
    You must also remove any sTestFile entries from your game INI files.
  - BSA Packer currently does not support the newer Starfield archive formats and will pack files in the Fallout 4 BA2 format.
    This appears to work just fine and we will update to use the Starfield archive formats as soon as we can.
  - The BSA extractor has some trouble with archives containing numerous directories.
    Most archives are fine but you may experience extreme load times with the meshes / geometries base game archives due to them containing hundreds of thousands of individual directories.
  - Due to the nature of the game engine, only ESM files have relatively decent support and using another plugin type will generate warnings to describe the issues with using those plugins.
  - All Starfield diagnostic warnings can be disabled.
  - LOOT sorting is currently disabled by default as the LOOT team has decided that the issues with the engine make sorting too problematic. You can enable sorting in the Starfield settings.
    This could be useful if a future libloot / LOOT update allows sorting and can be hotfixed in MO2.

  Known issues
  Download Issues
  - There are still occasionally issues with index errors, we plan to resolve the remaining issues in 2.5.1
  - There can occasionally be 'failed to communicate' errors when downloading from Nexus
  - Often the download will still start regardless and this can be ignored
  - If not, usually just triggering the download again will continue normally
  Other
  - There are a few graphical issues due to Qt 6, particularly when using themes
  - Some dialogs have strangely colored text which changes when you mouse over it
  - Some icons can be doubled with a slight offset
  - Archive files with a lot of directories can take a very long time to load for BSATK, this is typically only an issue for the Starfield meshes / geometries archives
