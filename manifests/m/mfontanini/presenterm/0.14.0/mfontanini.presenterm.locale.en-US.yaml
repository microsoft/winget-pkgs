ReleaseNotes: |-
  New features
  - Add support for exporting presentations as HTML files (#566) (#595) (#575) (#599) - thanks @JustSimplyKyle.
  - Snippet execution output now contains configurable padding and built-in themes default to the same padding as snippets (2 spaces horizontally, one line vertically) (#592) (#593).
  - Add highlighting and execution support for Jsonnet (#585) - thanks @imobachgs.
  - Allow configuring snippets to be executed sequentially during exports (#584).
  Fixes
  - Skip slides with pauses correctly (#598).
  - Avoid printing text if there's no vertical space for it, which otherwise looks bad particularly when using font size > 1 (#594).

  - Don't add an extra pause after lists if there's nothing left (#580).
  - Allow interleaved spans and variables in footer (#577).
