ReleaseNotes: |-
  Breaking changes
  - The CLI parameter to generate the JSON schema for the config file (--generate-config-file-schema) is now hidden behind a json-schema feature flag. The JSON schema file for the latest version is already publicly available at https://github.com/mfontanini/presenterm/blob/${VERSION}/config-file-schema.json, so anyone can use it without having to generate it by hand. This allows cutting down the number of dependencies in this project quite a bit (#563).
  New features
  - Support for slide transitions is now available (#530):
    - Add fade slide transition (#534).
    - Add slide horizontally slide transition animation (#528).
    - Add collapse_horizontal slide transition (#560).
  - Add --output option to specify the path where the output file is written to during an export (#526) - thanks @marianozunino.
  - Allow specifying start/end lines in file snippet type (#565).
  - Allow letting pauses become new slides when exporting (#557).
  - Allow using images on right in footer (#554).
  - Add max_rows configuration to cap vertical size (#531).
  - Add julia language highlighting and execution support (#561).
  Fixes
  - Center overflow lines when using centered text (#546).
  - Don't add extra space before heading if prefix in theme is empty (#542).
  - Use no typst background in terminal-* built in themes (#535).
  - Use std::env::temp_dir in the external_snippet test (#533) - thanks @Medovi.
  - Respect extends in a theme set via path in front matter (#532).
  Misc
  - Refactor async renders (e.g. mermaid/typst/latex +render blocks, +exec blocks, etc) to work truly asynchronously. This causes the output to be polled faster, and causes jumping to a slide that contains an async render to take a likely negligible (but maybe noticeable) amount of time to be jumped to. This was needed for slide transitions to work seemlessly (#556).
  - Get rid of textproperties (#529).
  - Add links to presentations using presenterm (#544) - thanks @orhun.
  Performance improvements
  - A few performance improvements had to be done for slide transitions to work seemlessly:
    - Pre-scale ASCII images when transitions are enabled (#550).
    - Pre-scale generated images (#553).
    - Cache resized ASCII images (#547).
