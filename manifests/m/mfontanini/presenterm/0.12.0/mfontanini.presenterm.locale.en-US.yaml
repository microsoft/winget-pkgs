ReleaseNotes: |-
  Breaking changes
  - Using incremental lists now adds an extra pause before and after a list. Use the defaults.incremental_lists configuration parameter to go back to the previous behavior (#487) (#498).
  New features
  - PDF exports are now generated by invoking weasyprint rather than by using the now deprecated presenterm-export. This gets rid of the need for tmux and opens up the door for other export formats (#509) (#517).
  - PDF export dimensions can now also be specified in the config file rather than always having them inferred by the terminal size (#511).
  - Allow specifying path for temporary files generated during presentation export (#518).
  - Respect font sizes in generated PDF (#510).
  - Add skip_slide comment command to avoid including a slide in the final presentation (#505).
  - Add alignment comment command to specify text alignment for the remainder of a slide (#493) (#522).
  - Add --current-theme CLI parameter to display the theme being used (#489).
  - Add gruvbox dark theme (#483) - thanks @ret2src.
  Fixes
  - Fix broken ANSI escape code parsing which would cause command output to sometimes be incorrectly parsed and therefore led to its colors/attributes not being respected (#500).
  - Center lists correctly (#512) (#520).
  - Respect end slide shorthand in speaker notes mode (#494).
  - Use more visible colors in snippet execution output in terminal-light/dark themes (#485).
  - Show error if sixel mode is selected but disabled (#525).
  CI
  - Add nightly build job (#496).
  Docs
  - Fix typo in README.md (#490) - thanks @eltociear.
  - Correctly include layout pic (#495) - thanks @Tuxified.
  Misc
  - Cleanup text attributes (#519).
  - Refactor snippet processing (#484).
