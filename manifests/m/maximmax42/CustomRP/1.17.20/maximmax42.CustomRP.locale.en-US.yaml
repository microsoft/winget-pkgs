ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Fixed Discord image links not working.
    Mostly.
    I don't know if the image links will work for more than 2 weeks.
  - The earliest custom timestamp you can now set is 1970-01-01 0:00:01 UTC.
    But it only makes sense if you use a "dumb" presence (the one where you only fill out ID, Timestamp and small image's Key fields).
  - Fixed some labels not being positioned properly.
  - Updated French (new translator, Prototyx5; and a translator I forgot to mention in a previous release, SkyDream).
