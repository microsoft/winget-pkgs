ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Modernize the build toolchain with MSBuild for using MSIX packaging and parallel compilation support. (Thanks to AndromedaMelody, be5invis, 青春永不落幕 and oxygen-dioxide.)
  - Use VC-LTL 5.x toolchain to make the binary size even smaller than the official 7-Zip because we can use ucrtbase.dll directly and the optimizations from modern compile toolchain. (Thanks to mingkuang.)
  - Add the context menu support in Windows 10/11 File Explorer. (Thanks to shiroshan.)
  - New icons. (Designed by Alice (四月天), Chi Lei, Kenji Mouri, Rúben Garrido and Sakura Neko. Thanks to AndromedaMelody and 奕然.)
  - Minor tweaks. (Thanks to adrianghc, Blueberryy, ChuckMichael, Legna, Maicol Battistini, SakuraNeko and Zbynius.)
  - Update 7-Zip from 21.03 to 21.06. (Noticed by Dan, lychichem and sanderdewit. Thanks to Igor Pavlov.)
  - Enable parsing the NSIS script support in the NSIS archives. (Suggested by alanfox2000. Thanks to myfreeer.)
  - Merge features from 7-Zip ZStandard branch. (Suggested by fcharlie. Thanks to Tino Reichardt.)
