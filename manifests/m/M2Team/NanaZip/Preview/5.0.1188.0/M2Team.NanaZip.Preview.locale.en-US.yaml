ReleaseNotes: |
  I'm excited to announce that we've released the NanaZip 5.0 Preview 0 which is now available for download. This update contains several fixes and improvements.
  Important Note: NanaZip 5.0 Preview 0 contains the CVE-2024-11477 fix which was released in NanaZip 3.1.
  Originally I want to delay the next preview version of NanaZip for synchronizing the 7-Zip 24.09 source code. But Rafael Rivera told me that security should be higher priority than features. So, I decided to release this version. So, 7-Zip 24.09 synchronization needs another 5.0 Preview 0 release.

  Release Notes
    - This release includes all the improvements from NanaZip 3.1 (3.1.1080.0) (https://github.com/M2Team/NanaZip/releases/tag/3.1.1080.0).
    - Update Brazilian Portuguese translation. (Contributed by maisondasilva.)
    - Make sure NanaZip Core (except the Self Extracting Executables) and NanaZip Classic using ucrtbase.dll with 10.0.19041.0 version or later.
    - Update Mile.Windows.Helpers to 1.0.671. (https://github.com/ProjectMile/Mile.Windows.Helpers/tree/1.0.671.0)
    - Move NanaZip console version to NanaZip.Core project. (Not used in NanaZip MSIX package because we need to release the next preview to contain the CVE-2024-11477 fix in NanaZip 3.1.)
    - Remove C++/WinRT dependency for NanaZip.Codecs and NanaZip.Frieren.
    - Add GetDpiForWindowWrapper for NanaZip.Frieren.DarkMode to fix the legacy Windows compatibility issues.
    - Remove VC-LTL dependency for the Self Extracting Executables related projects.
    - Adjust the compilation configurations to optimize the binary size for the Self Extracting Executables.
    - Use Mile.Windows.UniCrt (https://github.com/ProjectMile/Mile.Windows.UniCrt) instead of VC-LTL.
    - Update NanaZip.Specification.SevenZip header file.
    - Start to simplify the NanaZip specific decoders and encoders implementation.
    - Synchronize the BLAKE3 implementation to 1.5.5. (https://github.com/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3/releases/tag/1.5.5)
    - Synchronize the RHash implementation to the latest master branch which is after v1.4.5. (rhash/RHash@cf2adf2)
    - Enable disabling child process creation for NanaZip Self Extracting Executables. (Except installer mode of Self Extracting Executables, which compiled binaries is not provided in the NanaZip MSIX package.)
