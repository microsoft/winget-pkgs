ReleaseNotes: |-
  I'm excited to announce that we've released the NanaZip 6.0 Preview 2, now available for download.
  Starting with NanaZip 6.0, the development team will adopt the new release-tag rule. Read https://github.com/M2Team/NanaZip/blob/main/Documents/Versioning.md#release-tags for more information.
  After NanaZip 6.0 Preview 2, I will try to fix some issues in my XAML toolchain and user-reported issues in Preview 2. I plan to release 6.0 Final to NanaZip Preview as the final test several days later. I will submit 6.0 stable to the Microsoft Store and wait for Microsoft's verification on February 18, 2026, because I hope the NanaZip 6.0 stable build may be 1632. That number can play many puns: Hex is 0x660, decimal digits can express all factors for (6, a.k.a. 1, 2, 3, 6). (Beauty of mathematics.)
