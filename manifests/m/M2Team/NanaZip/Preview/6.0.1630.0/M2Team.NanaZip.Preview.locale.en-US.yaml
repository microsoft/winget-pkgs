ReleaseNotes: |-
  I'm excited to announce that we've released the NanaZip 6.0 Final, now available for download.
  Starting with NanaZip 6.0, the development team will adopt the new release-tag rule. Read https://github.com/M2Team/NanaZip/blob/main/Documents/Versioning.md#release-tags for more information.
  I will submit 6.0 stable to the Microsoft Store and wait for Microsoft's verification on February 18, 2026, because I hope the NanaZip 6.0 stable build may be 1632. That number can play many puns: Hex is 0x660, decimal digits can express all factors for (6, a.k.a. 1, 2, 3, 6). (Beauty of mathematics.)
  If this release has no big issues, it will be recompiled as the stable version.
  This release also adjusts the main window UI layout.
  MainWindowLightMode MainWindowDarkMode
  Starting with NanaZip 6.0, we provide the official portable package mainly for testing. NanaZip File Manager is not included in the official portable package because it needs some rewriting in the 6.5 development stage.
  Caution
  NanaZip can be used as portable version if you use the official portable release package. It's designed for debugging/testing/development purpose and scenarios (a.k.a. Server Core, Windows PE, Windows RE, and Wine) really need portable version. But please note that some features is not available, such as context menu and file associations. Some issues will not be fixed if you are using NanaZip in portable mode.
  Caution
  We don't provide any support for users if they are using any non-official release packages, such as extracting the files from the MSIX package or copy from the NanaZipPackage project output. For example, if you are using the files extracted from the MSIX package of NanaZip like Scoop package manager does. We hugely recommend you to use the official release packages of NanaZip. For example, WinGet package manager uses NanaZip official release package to install NanaZip.
