ReleaseNotes: |-
  I'm excited to announce that we've released the NanaZip 6.0 Preview 1, now available for download.
  483664449-cc0d613e-5cac-4ef2-9713-99f06ec9e15c
  You will see many UI changes, although some issues may need to be resolved in future previews before the stable release.
  Huge thanks to dongle-the-gadget for several XAML-based UI changes.
  Starting Community Era
  Starting with NanaZip 6.0, the NanaZip project is governed by multiple Benevolent Dictators For Life who make final decisions by reaching an agreement offline. This structure is chosen to avoid the risks of a single point of control while maintaining efficiency over a large committee. Here are current active Benevolent Dictators For Life:
  - dinhngtu (Tu Dinh), https://github.com/dinhngtu
  - Kenji Mouri, https://github.com/MouriNaruto
  Also, the following contributors are recognized as candidates for the Benevolent Dictator For Life role. In their current capacity, they serve as valued consultants to the active Benevolent Dictators For Life due to their significant and valuable contributions to the project:
  - AndromedaMelody, https://github.com/AndromedaMelody
  - Dongle, https://github.com/dongle-the-gadget
  - Sakura Neko, https://github.com/SakuraNeko
  Read https://github.com/M2Team/NanaZip/blob/main/Documents/People.md for more information.
  We also update several documents for this transitioning:
  - Read https://github.com/M2Team/NanaZip/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md for the contributing guide.
  - Read https://github.com/M2Team/NanaZip/blob/main/Documents/Security.md for the security policy.
  Also, M2-Team began to provide an official Discord-based community. Here is the invitation link: https://discord.gg/YhZYP4QMBx
  System Requirements Changes
  Here are the system requirements starting with NanaZip 6.0:
  - Supported Operating Systems:
    - Windows 10, version 2004 (Build 19041) or later
    - Windows Server 2022 (Build 20348) or later
  - Supported Platforms:
    - x86 (64-bit)
    - ARM (64-bit)
  Note: Due to the Self Extracting Executables (SFX) will be migrated to x86 (64-bit) starting with NanaZip 6.0, it gives users chances to use Self Extracting Executables (SFX) archives under 64-bit Microsoft official Windows PE and Windows RE instances:
  - For ARM (64-bit) Microsoft official Windows PE and Windows RE, you need to make sure you Windows PE and Windows RE images are built with Windows ADK Build 25398 or later and integrated the x64 emulation optional component.
  - For ARM (64-bit) Windows 10, I suggest you to upgrade to Windows 11 because ARM (64-bit) Windows 11 provides x64 emulation support, and Windows 10 is nearly end of support from Microsoft.
