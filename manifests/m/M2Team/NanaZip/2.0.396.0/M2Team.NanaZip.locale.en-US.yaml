  Known issues
  - If you can't find NanaZip in the context menu, please restart all File Explorer processes via Task Manager.
  - Due to the issues in Desktop Bridge file system virtualization, you are unable to use NanaZip in the Safe Mode of Windows.
  - Due to the policy from Microsoft Store, NanaZip is unable to disable Desktop Bridge file system virtualization, so the file operations in %UserProfile%/AppData will be redirected in Windows 10, and file operations in directories other than Local, LocalLow and Roaming in %UserProfile%/AppData will still be redirected in Windows 11.
  - Due to the Microsoft Store limitations, NanaZip 1.2 and later won't support languages not mentioned in https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/publish/supported-languages.
