ReleaseNotes: |-
  I'm excited to announce that we've released the NanaZip 6.0, now available for download.
  MainWindowLightMode MainWindowDarkMode
  First, you will see many UI changes. Huge thanks to dongle-the-gadget for several XAML-based UI changes.
  Starting with NanaZip 6.0 Final (6.0.1630.0), we have fixed some security vulnerabilities reported from haaeein:
  - CVE-2026-26282
  - CVE-2026-27014
  - CVE-2026-27114
  Starting with NanaZip 6.0, we provide the official portable package mainly for testing. NanaZip File Manager is not included in the official portable package because it needs some rewriting in the 6.5 development stage.
  Caution
  NanaZip can be used as portable version if you use the official portable release package. It's designed for debugging/testing/development purpose and scenarios (a.k.a. Server Core, Windows PE, Windows RE, and Wine) really need portable version. But please note that some features is not available, such as context menu and file associations. Some issues will not be fixed if you are using NanaZip in portable mode.
  Caution
  We don't provide any support for users if they are using any non-official release packages, such as extracting the files from the MSIX package or copy from the NanaZipPackage project output. For example, if you are using the files extracted from the MSIX package of NanaZip like Scoop package manager does. We hugely recommend you to use the official release packages of NanaZip. For example, WinGet package manager uses NanaZip official release package to install NanaZip.
  Starting with NanaZip 6.0, the development team will adopt the new release-tag rule. Read https://github.com/M2Team/NanaZip/blob/main/Documents/Versioning.md#release-tags for more information.
  Starting with NanaZip 6.0, the NanaZip project is governed by multiple Benevolent Dictators For Life who make final decisions by reaching an agreement offline. This structure is chosen to avoid the risks of a single point of control while maintaining efficiency over a large committee. Here are current active Benevolent Dictators For Life:
  - dinhngtu (Tu Dinh), https://github.com/dinhngtu
  - Kenji Mouri, https://github.com/MouriNaruto
  Also, the following contributors are recognized as candidates for the Benevolent Dictator For Life role. In their current capacity, they serve as valued consultants to the active Benevolent Dictators For Life due to their significant and valuable contributions to the project:
  - AndromedaMelody, https://github.com/AndromedaMelody
  - Dongle, https://github.com/dongle-the-gadget
  - Sakura Neko, https://github.com/SakuraNeko
  Read https://github.com/M2Team/NanaZip/blob/main/Documents/People.md for more information.
  We also update several documents for this transitioning:
  - Read https://github.com/M2Team/NanaZip/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md for the contributing guide.
  - Read https://github.com/M2Team/NanaZip/blob/main/Documents/Security.md for the security policy.
  Also, M2-Team began to provide an official Discord-based community. Here is the invitation link: https://discord.gg/YhZYP4QMBx
  Here are the system requirements starting with NanaZip 6.0:
  - Supported Operating Systems:
    - Windows 10, version 2004 (Build 19041) or later
    - Windows Server 2022 (Build 20348) or later
  - Supported Platforms:
    - x86 (64-bit)
    - ARM (64-bit)
  Note: Due to the Self Extracting Executables (SFX) will be migrated to x86 (64-bit) starting with NanaZip 6.0, it gives users chances to use Self Extracting Executables (SFX) archives under 64-bit Microsoft official Windows PE and Windows RE instances:
  - For ARM (64-bit) Microsoft official Windows PE and Windows RE, you need to make sure you Windows PE and Windows RE images are built with Windows ADK Build 25398 or later and integrated the x64 emulation optional component.
  - For ARM (64-bit) Windows 10, I suggest you to upgrade to Windows 11 because ARM (64-bit) Windows 11 provides x64 emulation support, and Windows 10 is nearly end of support from Microsoft.
  Read https://github.com/M2Team/NanaZip/tree/main#system-requirements for more information.
