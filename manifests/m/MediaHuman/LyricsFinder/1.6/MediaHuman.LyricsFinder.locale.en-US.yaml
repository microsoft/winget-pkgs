  MediaHuman Lyrics Finder is a free software application that can help you find and add missing lyrics (song text) to all songs in your music library. The found lyrics are automatically saved to files. But don't worry, it's a safe operation because the application will not overwrite the lyrics you already have.
  Very easy to use: just drag and drop some tracks from your favorite music player (e.g. Apple Music/iTunes) and MediaHuman Lyrics Finder will do the rest. The found lyrics will be saved automatically.
  MediaHuman Lyrics Finder gives you access to over a million different lyrics collected from various sources on the Internet.
