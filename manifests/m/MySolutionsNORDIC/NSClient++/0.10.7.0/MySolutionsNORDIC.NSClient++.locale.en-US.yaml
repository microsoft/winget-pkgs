ShortDescription: A fully fledged monitoring agent which can be used with many monitoring tools.
Description: |-
  NSClient++ (nscp) aims to be a simple yet powerful and secure monitoring daemon. It was built for Nagios/Icinga, but nothing in the daemon is Nagios/Icinga specific and it can be used in many other scenarios where you want to receive/distribute check metrics.
  The daemon has 3 main functions:
  - Allow a remote machine (monitoring server) to request commands to be run on this machine (the monitored machine) which return the status of the machine.
  - Submit the same results to a remote (monitoring server).
  - Take action and perform tasks.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  PLEASE NOTE That there is a new legacy-xp binary which can be used on older version of windows..
  NRPE updates
  - NRPE setup now supports 2-way tls
  - Also fixed many issues with the cli to make ti tork more reliable.
  Command to set up 1-way TLS NRPE server
  nscp nrpe install --allowed-hosts 127.0.0.1 --insecure=false ^
  	--verify=none --certificate nsclient.pem --certificate-key nsclient.key
  nscp nrpe install --allowed-hosts 127.0.0.1 --insecure=false ^
  	--verify=peer-cert --certificate nsclient.pem --certificate-key nsclient.key --ca ca.pem
  Installer:
  Added installer option IMPORT_CONFIG to allow copying a configuration during installation.
  This is a great way to simplify configuration distribution during installation if you do not have better tools in place.
  To import the configuration from a http server you can do:
  $ msiexec /i NSClient++.msi IMPORT_CONFIG=http://myserver.com/nsclient.ini
  This release also fixes import of http configuration so you can do:
  $ nscp settings --migrate-from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mickem/nscp/refs/heads/main/tests/rest/nsclient.ini
  Improved how debug in queries work
  Using the debug option with queries is now much simpler.
  First it will return the debug data instead of adding it to the log making it possible to use this remote (please note that many protocols have payload limits).
  The output is now simplified as it includes useful details about the object as well as a standardized list:
  ignored  c:\src\nscp\build\docker\debian-9\Dockerfile
  match    c:\src\nscp\build\docker\files\plugin_pb2.py
  ignored  c:\src\nscp\build\perl\echo_date.pl
  match    c:\src\nscp\build\python\config.py
  warning  c:\src\nscp\build\python\create_plugin_module.py
  match    c:\src\nscp\build\python\create_zip_module.py
  match    c:\src\nscp\build\python\mk_pyzip.py
  Where:
  ignored means the item did not match the filter
  match means the item matched the filter and was not critical nor warning.
  warning and critical means the item is a warning or a critical.
  Windows XP support: is back
  This version brings back experimental Windows XP support.
  As I am unable to get a Windows XP machine up and running I cannot verify it but it runs on Windows 2008 (which is the oldest test machine I have) and in theory it should run on Windows XP with a lot of service packs.
  If you have access to old machines, please do give it a spin and let me know how it goes.
  To install NSClient++ on Windows XP use the Win32-legacy-xp packages below.
  Please note: MSI files might not work (as it requires newer MSI version) but you should be able to use the zip in those cases.
  Documentation
  - Updated links and fixed various markdown issues making the documentation easier to read.
  - A new guide explaining how to configure NRPE with and without certificate authentication making on boarding NRPE much much easier.
  - Many other changes and fixes in the documentation
  Updated to OpenSSL 3.5.x:
  This is actually huge as OpenSSL which I updated to a year or so ago when I started to updated dependencies was the last 1.1.1 version.
  There are numerous changes is 3.5.4 which we will eventually start to benefit from but for now the only benefit is that the certificate generation is a bit improved.
  Various minor improvements:
  - Fixed some configuration keys which where missing the comment describing what they are in the config file.
  - Added option debug verify to show why certificate validation fails, this option will likely be removed and replaced by default handling in the future.
  - check_memory Change text syntax of check_memory from only show used to show "type: used/total"
  - CheckExternalScripts Added new option under [/settings/external scripts] called kill tree=true to kill process tree when exiting process.
  - Fix for update not working on Windows 2025
  - Updated the mongoose web server to latest version (and dependency)
