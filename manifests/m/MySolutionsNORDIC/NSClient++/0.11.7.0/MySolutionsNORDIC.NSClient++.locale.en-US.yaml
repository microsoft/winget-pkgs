ShortDescription: A fully fledged monitoring agent which can be used with many monitoring tools.
Description: |-
  NSClient++ (nscp) aims to be a simple yet powerful and secure monitoring daemon. It was built for Nagios/Icinga, but nothing in the daemon is Nagios/Icinga specific and it can be used in many other scenarios where you want to receive/distribute check metrics.
  The daemon has 3 main functions:
  - Allow a remote machine (monitoring server) to request commands to be run on this machine (the monitored machine) which return the status of the machine.
  - Submit the same results to a remote (monitoring server).
  - Take action and perform tasks.
