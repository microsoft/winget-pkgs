ShortDescription: A fully fledged monitoring agent which can be used with many monitoring tools.
Description: |-
  NSClient++ (nscp) aims to be a simple yet powerful and secure monitoring daemon. It was built for Nagios/Icinga, but nothing in the daemon is Nagios/Icinga specific and it can be used in many other scenarios where you want to receive/distribute check metrics.
  The daemon has 3 main functions:
  - Allow a remote machine (monitoring server) to request commands to be run on this machine (the monitored machine) which return the status of the machine.
  - Submit the same results to a remote (monitoring server).
  - Take action and perform tasks.

  What's Changed
  Minor update which has some code and documentation changes as well as one bugfix:
  - check_process should show memory values in human readable form i.e. 1234567 (bytes) should be converted to 1.236MB. This is similar to how other size related check work.
    An example of how it now looks:
  check_process "warn=working_set > 3G" "crit=working_set > 5G" "detail-syntax=%(exe) working-set: %(working_set)"
  L        cli WARNING: WARNING: clion64.exe working-set: 3.945GB
