  About
  jj is a Git-compatible version control system that is both simple and powerful. See the installation instructions to get started.
  Release highlights
  - Experimental support for transferring the change ID to/from Git remotes behind configuration
    setting git.write-change-id-header. If this is enabled, the change ID will be stored in the Git
    commit itself (in a commit header called change-id), which means it will be transferred by
    regular git push etc. This is an evolving feature that currently defaults to "false". This
    default will likely change in the future as we gain confidence with forge support and user
    expectations.
  Breaking changes
  - jj git push -c/--change no longer moves existing local bookmarks.
  - The editor-*.jjdescription files passed to your editor by e.g. jj describe
    are now written to your system's temporary directory instead of .jj/repo/.
  Deprecations
  - git.subprocess = false has been deprecated, and the old libgit2
    code path for fetches and pushes will be removed entirely in 0.30.
    Please report any remaining issues you have with the Git
    subprocessing path.
  - ui.default-description has been deprecated, and will be migrated to
    template-aliases.default_commit_description. Please also consider using
    templates.draft_commit_description,
    and/or templates.commit_trailers.
  - On macOS, config.toml files in ~/Library/Application Support/jj are
    deprecated; one should instead use $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/jj
    (defaults to ~/.config/jj)
  New features
  - Color-words diff has gained an option to compare conflict pairs without
    materializing.
  - jj show patches can now be suppressed with --no-patch.
  - Added ui.bookmark-list-sort-keys setting to configure default sort keys for the
    jj bookmark list command.
  - New signed revset function to filter for cryptographically signed commits.
  - jj describe, jj commit, jj new, jj squash and jj split add the
    commit trailers, configured in the commit_trailers template, to the commit
    description. Use cases include DCO Sign Off and Gerrit Change Id.
  - Added duplicate_description template, which allows customizing the descriptions
    of the commits jj duplicate creates.
  - jj absorb can now squash a deleted file if it was added by one of the
    destination revisions.
  - Added ui.streampager.show-ruler setting to configure whether the ruler should be
    shown when the builtin pager starts up.
  - jj git fetch now warns instead of erroring for unknown git.fetch remotes
    if other remotes are available.
  - Commit objects in templates now have trailers() -> List<Trailer>, the Trailer
    objects have key() -> String and value() -> String.
  - jj config edit will now roll back to previous version if a syntax error has been introduced in the new config.
  - When using dynamic command-line completion, revision names will be completed
    in more complex expressions. For example, typing
    jj log -r first-bookmark..sec and then pressing Tab could complete the
    expression to first-bookmark..second-bookmark.
  Fixed bugs
  - Fixed crash on change-delete conflict resolution. #6250
  - The builtin diff editor now tries to preserve unresolved conflicts. #4963
  - Fixed bash and zsh shell completion when completing aliases of multiple arguments. #5377
  Packaging changes
  - Jujutsu now uses zlib-rs, a fast compression library written in Rust. Packagers should remove any dependency on CMake and drop the packaging Cargo feature.
