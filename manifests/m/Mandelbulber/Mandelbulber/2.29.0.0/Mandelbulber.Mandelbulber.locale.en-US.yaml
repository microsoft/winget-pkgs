  - Shaders:
    Added parameter to control amount of emitted light by luminosity effect
  - Shaders:
    Fixed bug in ambient occlusion effect and iteration fog
  - Shaders:
    Fixed problem with global positioning of primitives and textures
  - Primitives:
    Modified UI for managing primitive objects (to be like for light sources)
  - Primitives:
    Added button for duplicating of primitives
  - Primitives:
    Added wire-frame previews for primitives
  - Primitives:
    Added possibility to drag primitives using mouse pointer
  - Primitives:
    Added buttons:
    Enable all, Disable all, Only selected in the primitive manager

  - Primitives:
    Added primitive prism
  - Primitives:
    Added bounding boxes for individual primitives
  - Primitives:
    Reworked icons for primitives
  - UI: Added warning message when attempt to stop render when rendering took already 10 minutes
  - UI: fixed bug in calculation of clipping plane for wire-frame objects
  - UI: Added switch to change precision of pop-up sliders
