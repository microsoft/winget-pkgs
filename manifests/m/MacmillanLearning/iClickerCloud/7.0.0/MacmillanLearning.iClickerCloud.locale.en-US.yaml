  - NEW: Security improvements
  - FIXED: Polling’s image capture selection is cleared when the class session ends rather than persisting until the application is relaunched
  - FIXED: Resolved an issue where the image selection dialog would sometimes get captured as part of the first Polling question’s image
  - FIXED: Quiz setup dialogs now float over all other applications, including presentations, rather than opening behind the application in focus.
