ReleaseNotes: |-
  Breaking changes
  - Due to the different signature and configuration file, the WinUI 3 releases (that is, 2.0.0 onwards) are not backwards compatible with the older Islands releases. As such, you will need to manually migrate your rules and uninstall the older version.
  - [NEW] Rule prioritization has now been reverted to be similar to v1.
  New features
  - Turkish translation (thanks to @baglayan)
  Fixes
  - Fixed an issue where restarting Explorer would cause the Mica For Everyone icon to show on the taskbar (#498)
  - Exclude WS_EX_TRANSPARENT windows, so Mica For Everyone no longer hides the recording region when Snipping Tool recording is used.
  Regressions and known issues
  - A Win32 installer is not available.
  - The Custom Title Bar Color option doesn't do anything.
  - Launching the app as administrator on startup is not available.
  - Many languages previously in v1 are not available.
