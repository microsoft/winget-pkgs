ReleaseNotes: |-
  Breaking changes
  - Due to the different signature and configuration file, the WinUI 3 releases (that is, 2.0.0 onwards) are not backwards compatible with the older Islands releases. As such, you will need to manually migrate your rules and uninstall the older version.
  - Rule prioritization has now been reverted to be similar to v1.
  Microsoft Store release
  We are now available on the Microsoft Store!
  Note: the preexisting sideload version and Microsoft Store version will exist independently from each other. We recommend having only one installed to prevent conflicts.
  New features
  - The custom title bar color option is now available. You can select a color using the "Custom color" option.
  - To help in diagnosing issues, this version includes App Center telemetry. This telemetry is anonymous and conforms to this Privacy Policy. You may choose to turn it off in Settings.
  Regressions and known issues
  - A Win32 installer is not available.
  - Launching the app as administrator on startup is not available.
  - Many languages previously in v1 are not available.
  Installation
  You can either download from the Microsoft Store link above or download the MicaForEveryone.appinstaller file below. An Internet connection is required. If you have previously installed Mica For Everyone through the App Installer file, you should automatically receive this update.
