ReleaseNotes: |-
  Features:
  - Moore Threads GPU add support to query number of cores (#1259, GPU)
  - Cache detection result based on last modification time (Packages)
  - Add cmake options to disable certain package managers at compile time
      - Package managers are encouraged to disable some package managers by passing -DPACKAGES_DISABLE_ when running cmake. For example, when building for Arch Linux, -DPACKAGES_DISABLE_APK=ON -DPACKAGES_DISABLE_DPKG=ON -DPACKAGES_DISABLE_RPM=ON ... should be specified.
      - See all available options by running cmake -L | grep PACKAGES_DISABLE_
      - This option does NOT remove the detection code. It just disables the detection at runtime. One can still use --packages-disabled "" to enable all package managers.
  - Add new option --show-localip-{speed,mtu} (LocalIP)
  - Add new module Btrfs, which prints all mounted Btrfs volumes, like Zpool module (#1262, Linux)
  - Improve Wifi module support for macOS Sequoia (Wifi, macOS)
      - Currently it uses system_profiler which costs about 2 seconds on my MBP. I suggest disabling it for now until a better solution is found.
  Bugfixes:
  - Fix invalid CPU temperature detection on FreeBSD (#1260, CPU, FreeBSD)
  - Remove showPeCoreCount support on FreeBSD (#1260, CPU, FreeBSD)
  - Don't use Wifi speed as Ethernet speed (LocalIP, FreeBSD)
  - Fix compiling with old linux headers (Camera, Linux)
  - Fix detecting public ipv6 address (PublicIP, Windows)
  Logo:
  - Fix parrot logo detection
  - Rename TorizonCore to Torizon OS
