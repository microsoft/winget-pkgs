ReleaseNotes: |-
  Deprecation Notice:
  - In fastfetch v2, the JSONC configuration format has been introduced, while command line configuration flags are kept for compatibility. Although they have the same effects, they use two different code paths, and as the number of flags grows, the codebase is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain.
    - Removal of module config flags is planned for v2.50.0, which will also fix a long-standing issue #1477.
    - Removal of most other config flags is also planned for later versions.
  - Keys of JSON configuration files will be all case-sensitive. Currently they are inconsistent. Planned for v2.50.0.
  Changes:
  - Due to more restrictive permissions in macOS Tahoe, SSID detection on macOS 26+ requires root privileges. <redacted> will be displayed otherwise.
    - #1874 reported that 15.6 doesn't work either
  Features:
  - Improve nouveau driver support for --gpu-driver-specific (GPU, Linux)
    - VRAM size detection
    - GPU temperature detection
    - Core count detection (when available)
  - Improve Scoop package manager detection (Packages, Windows)
    - Support scoop-global
    - Read Scoop's config file to find the installation path of Scoop
  - Improve ARM SoC detection (CPU, Android)
    - Make SoC detection more lenient. Higher chance to match at the cost of accuracy.
    - Add more Snapdragon SoC names
  - Support labwc WM version detection, used for XFCE4 on Wayland (WM, Linux)
  - Improve accuracy of GPU temperature detection for Intel dedicated GPUs on Windows (GPU, Windows)
  - Parse unicode escaped strings generated by qt5ct (#1864, Font, Linux)
  - Add --{duration,percent,size,freq,temp}-space-before-unit [always|never] options to add a space before the unit when printing duration, percent, size, frequency and temperature values
  - Add --duration-abbreviation to abbreviate duration values in custom format
    - For example: 1 day, 2 hours, 3 mins will be displayed as 1d 2h 3m
  - Add --percent-width to pad the percent value with spaces to a fixed width
    - For example: --percent-width 3 will display 50% instead of 50%; useful for aligning percent values in custom format
  Bugfixes:
  - Improve accuracy of Flatpak count detection (#1856, Packages, Linux)
  - Remove qi package manager support (#1858, Packages, Linux)
  - Fix LocalIP module on Windows (LocalIP, Windows)
    - Fix default route detection when multiple network interfaces are connected
    - Fix link speed calculation
  - Fix interface status when the interface is up but not connected (Wifi, Linux)
  - Fix variable names in custom format (#1861)
    - full-path to path (Editor)
    - session to session-name (Users)
    - name to project-name (Version)
  - Fix wrong /s assignment in custom format (#1871, DiskIO)
  Logos:
  - Add Aeon
  - Remove Evolinx
