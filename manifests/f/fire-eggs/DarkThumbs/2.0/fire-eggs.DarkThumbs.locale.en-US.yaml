ReleaseNotes: |-
  Feature and bugfix release! Marked as "V2.0" because 7-zip is the new archive engine.
  New file formats supported!
  - 7z / cb7
  - djvu
  Issues addressed:
  - #90 : zip files larger than 2G supported
  - #33 : some zip files weren't working with Unzip
  - #35 : "version is blocked" message when trying to install new version. Note: I still recommend the uninstall / install for preference, as a "replacement" install appears to require a Windows restart!
  Known Limitation!
  Currently requires being installed in "C:\Program Files\DarkThumbs" folder! If you want to install in a different location, you must copy 7z.dll from the install folder into "C:\Windows\System32".
