ShortDescription: Notepad2, a fast and light-weight Notepad-like text editor with syntax highlighting.
Description: |-
  A few years ago, I found myself writing my first PHP projects using metapad. When I was looking
  around for text editors with syntax highlighting, I have come across the Scintilla source code
  editing component. I was very much impressed by this project, so I decided to create my own
  Scintilla-based text editor.

  The result is Notepad2, a fast and light-weight Notepad-like text editor with syntax highlighting.
  This program can be run out of the box without installation, and does not touch your system's registry.
