ShortDescription: A command line interface (CLI) tool for managing Fleet from the command line.
Description: |-
  fleetctl (pronounced "Fleet control") is a command line interface (CLI) tool for managing Fleet from the command line. fleetctl enables a GitOps workflow with Fleet.
  fleetctl also provides a quick way to work with all the data exposed by Fleet without having to use the Fleet UI or work directly with the Fleet API.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Security Engineers
  - Added support for Smallstep certificate authority.
  - Added false-positive filtering for Linux vulnerability scanning.
  - Added support for Arch Linux hosts.
  - Added software inventory ingestion from Arch Linux hosts.
  - Added new rate limiting implementation for Fleet Desktop API endpoints to support all/many hosts of a deployment behind NAT (single IP).
  - Added support for reading server private_key from AWS Secrets Manager.
  - Added support for vulnerabilities feed CPE translation JSON to override sw_edition field.
  - Added filter for removing duplicate RPM python packages and renaming pip packages to match OVAL definitions (same as Ubuntu).
  - Added ability to specify a Fleet host ID when declaring a manual label in a Gitops YAML file.
  - Added a dedicated page, table, and logical integrations with other parts of the UI for managing labels.
  IT Admins
  - Added configuration profile support for Android hosts.
  - Added activity logging for Android profile creation, modification, and deletion.
  - Added support for software installation during Windows setup experience.
  - Added support for Arch Linux hosts.
  - Added software inventory ingestion from Arch Linux hosts.
  - Added support to fleetctl to generate fleetd installers for Arch Linux (.pkg.tar.zst).
  - Added software name into checksum calculation for macOS apps.
  - Added ability to specify a Fleet host ID when declaring a manual label in a Gitops YAML file.
  - Added a dedicated page, table, and logical integrations with other parts of the UI for managing labels.
  - Added OpenTelemetry instrumentation to scheduled jobs and several API endpoints.
  - Added CRON job to reconcile Android profiles.
  - Added retries with backoff when Apple's assets API fails with a timeout error.
  - Added ability to unenroll personal iOS/iPadOS devices from Fleet.
  - Added support for assigning host labels based on idP attributes for iOS and iPadOS hosts.
  - Added ability to turn off MDM for iOS and iPadOS devices when refetcher returns device token is inactive.
    Note: The package will need to be updated out-of-band once, because the pre-removal script from previously-generated packages is called upon an upgrade. The old pre-removal script stopped Orbit unconditionally.
  - Added support for hosts enrolled with Company Portal using the legacy SSO extension (for Entra's conditional access).
  Other improvements and bug fixes
  - Updated DEB and RPM packages generated by fleetctl package to now be safe to upgrade in-band through the Software page.
  - Updated to return count in list host certificates API response, and use it in the certificate table.
  - Updated setup experience to try software installs up to 3 times by default in case of intermittent failures.
  - Modified the Apple profile reconciliation CRON logic to query for installs and removals within a transaction to avoid race conditions around team or label changes.
  - Fixed inconsistent spacing in Controls OS settings headers.
  - Validated setting manual_agent_install option on the server.
  - Ignore warning when LastOpenedAt for software is nil on macOS.
  - Improved install action tooltips and modals including timestamps to VPP successful installs.
  - Changed the response code for UserAuthenticate checkin messages, which are unsupported, from a 5XX to "410 Gone" as specified in the Apple MDM protocol docs for servers that do not implement this method.
  - Ensured UI consistency by adding a border to the empty state of End User Authentication section.
  - Added easy to understand error messages when configuring Entra conditional access in Fleet.
  - Updated docs for the pwd_policy table to better reflect the meaning of days_to_expiration.
  - Improved the layout of the IdP-driven label form.
  - Updated Hosts table > hostname column to truncate overflowing hostnames and place the full name in a tooltip on hover.
  - Removed duplicate tar.gz copies of osqueryd and Fleet Desktop from built packages (DEB/RPM/PKG).
  - Extended the number of errors Fleet looks for when determining whether we should invalidate the prepared statements cache.
  - Updated instructions in Linux key escrow modal.
  - Adjusted log level to "info" instead of "error" when Windows MDM endpoints generate client errors (e.g. empty binary security token).
  - Disabled debug logging by default in fleetctl preview and reformatted login information.
  - Improved handling of host details page label pills for labels with very long names.
  - Modified Controls > OS settings > Custom settings so profile upload time is based on updated_at instead of created_at.
  - Added check to GitOps command to throw error if positional arguments are detected.
  - Added an error message when software is defined in a package YAML file in GitOps but some fields expected in that file were set at the team level. Previously, GitOps would silently ignore the fields set at the team level in this case.
  - Updated the OS updates current versions empty state to match consistancy with other empty states.
  - Updated message shown in the 'Delete Script' modal.
  - Added a delay to the platform compatibility tooltip showing when creating or editing a query.
  - Added error when uploading signed profiles instead of when trying to deliver them.
  - Updated old end user migration workflow preview, and switch to video for product consistency.
  - Replaced outdated Firefox icon with a new one that follows brand guidelines.
  - Updated UI to make policy pass/fail icons and copy consistent across host details, my device, and manage policies tables.
  - Removed the software renaming fix introduced in 4.73.3 due to MySQL DB performance issues.
  - Optimized software ingestione rename functionality to generate less lock contention during high concurrency.
  - Optimized ingestion of software names on macOS apps when vendor-supplied bundle executable names are unclear.
  - Optimized software title reconciliation in vulnerabilities cron job.

  - Fixed required query parameters using field name instead of parameter name in error messages
  - Fixed a bug where blocking of VPP installs on personally enrolled Apple devices was not in place.
  - Fixed edit teams action in VPP table dropdown not being blocked when Fleet is in GitOps mode.
  - Fixed certificate ingest parser to no longer break on multiple equal signs in certificate key pair values.
  - Fixed certificate ingest parser to allow for only multiple relative distinguished names separated by +.
  - Fixed 422 error when hitting /api/v1/fleet/commands endpoint with team filter.

  - Fixed cases where Firefox ESR installations would have false-positive vulnerabilities reported that were backported to the ESR.
  - Fixed clicking the currently selected navbar item would cause a full-page rerender.
  - Fixed EULA path to be relative to the YAML file in fleetctl gitops, as it is for other settings.

  Fleet-maintained app updates and vulnerability fixes are applied, whether or not you upgrade.
  Fleet's agent
  The following version of Fleet's agent (fleetd) support the latest changes to Fleet:
  1. orbit-v1.48.1
  2. fleet-desktop-v1.48.1 (included with Orbit)
  3. fleetd-chrome-v1.3.3
  While newer versions of fleetd still function with older versions of the Fleet server (and vice versa), Fleet does not actively test these scenarios and some newer features won't be available.
