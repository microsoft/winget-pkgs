  Fleet's agent
  The following version of Fleet's agent (fleetd) support the latest changes to Fleet:
  1. orbit-v1.50.2
  2. fleet-desktop-v1.50.2 (included with Orbit)
  3. osquery-5.21.0 (included with Orbit)
  4. fleetd-chrome-v1.3.3
  5. fleetd-android-v1.0.2
  While newer versions of fleetd still function with older versions of Fleet, old versions of fleetd and osquery may not function with new versions of Fleet. We do not actively test these scenarios, and we recommend deploying a minimum of the agent versions above before upgrading to this version of Fleet.
