Description: |-
  fleetctl (pronounced "Fleet control") is a command line interface (CLI) tool for managing Fleet from the command line. fleetctl enables a GitOps workflow with Fleet.
  fleetctl also provides a quick way to work with all the data exposed by Fleet without having to use the Fleet UI or work directly with the Fleet API.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Security Engineers
  - Added support for Microsoft Entra ID conditional access.
  - Updated vulnerabilities feed to fall back to non-primary CVSSv2/v3 sources when primary (NVD) data is not available, instead of omitting scores entirely.
  - Updated custom SCEP proxy implementation to include one-time challenges.
  - Added the source and username fields for host certificates, reporting 'system' or 'user' based on which keychain it was from (for macOS, it will be 'user' if coming from the "login" keychain), and the corresponding username if the source is 'user'.
  - Updated certificates card on the host details and my device page to show a new keychain column.
  IT Admins
  - Added support for Microsoft Entra ID conditional access.
  - Enabled Android MDM support. The functionality is limited to turning on Android MDM and enrolling a BYOD device.
  NOTE: If your server was already using Android via the experimental DEV_ANDROID_ENABLED=1 flag, please turn off Android MDM before updating your Fleet server.
  - Added support for filtering the hosts page for hosts with any of the 3 batch script execution statuses.
  - Extended POST /api/v1/fleet/hosts/:id/wipe endpoint to allow users to specify the type of remote wipe for windows hosts.
  - Improved releasing a macOS device during ADE enrollment, by increasing the frequency of checks for readiness.
  - Added an audit log activity item for automatic install policy creation.
  Other improvements and bug fixes
  - Updated the Open Policy Agent (OPA) dependency to v1.4.2.
  NOTE: This upgrade drops support for YAML 1.1 in configuration files. If you use the -c option to specify a configuration file when starting the Fleet server, you will need to update any yes or on values in the file to true, and any no or off values to false.
  - Improved error and loading state for self-service page.
  - Implemented searching the teams dropdown.
  - Removed sort column buttons for host software columns that do not support sorting.
  - Updated migrations to use the utf8mb4_unicode_ci collation across all tables and added a test to validate that new migrations use this collation.
  - Added new optional parameter --outfile to fleetctl package to override the filename being generated.
  - Updated software detection so that a new installer uploaded over an FMA app does not report as an FMA app.
  - Improved error when trying to apply builtin labels.
  - Updated copy and remove platform callout in manage automations modal.
  - Update UI references to "Frequency" to now say "Interval".
  - Prevented editing the UI MDM > End user migration section when GitOps mode is enabled, since this is GitOps-configurable.
  - Made the gap between characters in password fields consistent.
  - Updated to consistent 14px font size across all input and dropdown fields.
  - Removed username requirements for certain MDM CIS policies.
  - Added macOS redis cluster support.
  - Changed to using DeleteObject S3 api for GCP interoperability.
  - Updated to use the Source Code Pro font in the Disk encryption key modal for clear differentiation betweenvthe letter oh and the number zero.
  - Updated go to 1.24.4
  - Fixed result count shown when running a policy.
  - Fixed bug with the 'Observers can run this query' tooltip due to missing styling rules.
  - Fixed possible user invite race condition.
  - Fixed issue where NDES SCEP admin page was parsed using wrong UTF16 endianness.
  - Fixed manual labels in gitops not selecting hosts by hardware serial or uuid.
  - Fixed a database bug where the host_uuid column was too small in some secondary tables related to ADE-enrollment and IdP accounts.
  - Fixed missing CORS header check for JSON requests.
  - Fixed bug when listing software titles for 'All teams' which caused duplicated entries.
  - Fixed a bug that caused custom OS settings targeted using "include any" label rules to never verify on hosts that only included a subset of the targeted labels
  - Fixed the Docker Fleet-maintained app install script to prevent a successful install from showing
    up as a failure due to directory existence checks (live as of 2025-06-13 FMA update).
  - Fixed issue causing a 500 error when clicking "Manage Automations" from the Queries page when osquery logging has certain configurations.
  - Fixed issue where you could not delete a bootstrap package.
  - Fixed policy autofill using incorrect media-type for query.
  - Fleet Free: Removed the installer dropdown (Premium-only) from the Software page and Host details > Software tab as installer filtering isnâ€™t applicable on the Free tier.
  - Fixed issue where users were not able to reenable end user migration in the UI.
  Fleet's agent
  The following version of Fleet's agent (fleetd) support the latest changes to Fleet:
  1. orbit-v1.44.0
  2. fleet-desktop-v1.44.0 (included with Orbit)
  3. fleetd-chrome-v1.3.2
  While newer versions of fleetd still function with older versions of the Fleet server (and vice versa), Fleet does not actively test these scenarios and some newer features won't be available.
