  Security Engineers

  - Added ability to set conditional access per policy, and update host policy UI to incorporate conditional access data.
  - Added CVE ID as matching criteria for host software queries, in addition to software name. Also rebuild host software querying for better maintainability.
  - Updated Fleet-managed DigiCert, NDES, and SCEP certificates to be renewed 30 days before expiry for those valid longer than 30 days or when half the validity period remains for certificates valid 30 days or less. Applies to certificates requested using this release or later.
  - Added webhook as a logging configuration option.
  - Added webhook query automation logging.
  - Added shell and Powershell syntax highlighting when editing scripts.
  - Added ability to run a script on a batch of hosts with a single user flow.
  - Added download validation and existing-installer matching in GitOps via a new hash_sha256 field in software YAML.
  - Added hash_sha256 field to the response for the GET /software/titles API.
  - Added fleetctl generate-gitops command to generate gitops YAML files based on current Fleet configuration.

  - Added last_mdm_enrolled_at and last_mdm_checked_in_at to host detail endpoints to return the last time a host enrolled, or re-enrolled in MDM and the last time a host checked in via MDM, respectively.
  - Added fleetctl generate-gitops command to generate gitops YAML files based on current Fleet configuration.
  - Updated Fleet-managed DigiCert, NDES, and SCEP certificates to be renewed 30 days before expiry for those valid longer than 30 days or when half the validity period remains for certificates valid 30 days or less. Applies to certificates requested using this release or later.
  - Updated host certificates with serial numbers below 2^63 will now display the decimal represntation of the serial number in addition to hex so that it is easier to match them up to what is displayed in the macOS keychain.
  - Updated Install Status to correctly display available for self-service VPP apps.
  - Logged invalid Windows MDM SOAP message and return 400 instead of 5XX. This change helps debug Windows MDM issues.

  Fleet's agent
  The following version of Fleet's agent (fleetd) support the latest changes to Fleet:
  1. orbit-v1.42.0
  2. fleet-desktop-v1.42.0 (included with Orbit)
