  Fleet's agent
  The following version of Fleet's agent (fleetd) support the latest changes to Fleet:
  1. orbit-v1.40.1
  2. fleet-desktop-v1.41.0 (included with Orbit)
  3. fleetd-chrome-v1.3.1
  While newer versions of fleetd still function with older versions of the Fleet server (and vice versa), Fleet does not actively test these scenarios and some newer features won't be available.
