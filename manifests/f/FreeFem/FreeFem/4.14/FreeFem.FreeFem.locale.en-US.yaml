ReleaseNotes: |-
  [4.14]
  Added
  - Finite element BDM2 and BDM2ortho in test, Bug in BDM2ortho corrected the 4 sept 2014 in version: v4.13-130-g1af52457
  - Conversion of matrix or transpose of matrix in int[int][int] array to get the structure of sparse matrix.
  see tutorial/sparse-matrix.edp example at end

  matrix A = va(Ph,Vh);
  int[int] a = A, at= A';


  - a meshL finite function can be see as real function with 1, or 2 parameters

   meshL ThL = segment(10); fespace VhL(ThL,P1); VhL u= x;
   cout << u(0.5)   << endl;
   cout << u(0.5,0) << endl;


  - Exemple to code convolution of 2 function with one with a small support
  too be not to expanxive
  see tutorial/Convolution-Sample.edp example
  - Support for dense blocks in PETSc matrices
  - GenEO for saddle-point examples with PCHPDDM in PETSc
  - Distributed ParaView output on meshS
  - Interface to mmg2d for two-dimensional mesh
  - Support for Mmg parameters localParameter, -nosizreq, -hgradreq`
  Changed
  - PETSc 3.20.2
  Deprecated
  Removed
  Fixed
  - bug in P3pnc3d in vectorial case (thank to loic.balaziatchynillama@cea.fr )
  - in segment(10,region=1,label=ll); region is now used..
  Sorry the ARM version (Apple-Silicon) was wrong before due to mistake in brew library
  (need to install brew gfortran)The new Mac version (develop) works after security authorization (see README.md) if not please
  send me a Mail frederic.hecht@sorbonne-universite.fr.Remarque: The dev file are the current develop version.
