ReleaseNotes: |-
  Start by downloading OpenKneeboard-v1.8.8.msi; the documentation is on OpenKneeboard.com.v1.8.5 and v1.8.7 were development builds; their changes are included as part of v1.8.6 and v1.8.8 respectively.Changes in v1.8.8
  - Fixed bug that could lead to SimHub integration not functioning
  - Fixed a bug in a workaround for a Microsoft PDV viewer bug which could lead to crashes when closing/reloading a PDF
  Changes in v1.8.6
  Bug fixes
  - Added additional workarounds for bug in the Windows App SDK's PDF library; this fixes some crashes when closing or reloading PDFs
  - Fix some additional rarer issues if PDFs are  rapidly opened and closed
  - Fixed crash if web dashboards that use OpenKneeboard's web API are closed while loading
  Other Improvements
  - The F-5E folder is now searched for DCS kneeboard images, in addition to F-5E-3
  - The active settings path is now written into HKCU, allowing integrations to read OpenKneeboard settings. OpenKneeboard does not read this registry value, and external programs should not modify settings.
