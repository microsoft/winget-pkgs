ReleaseNotes: |-
  Before installing: this might not be the latest release - you can always get the latest release here
  Start by downloading OpenKneeboard-v1.10.14.msi; the documentation is on OpenKneeboard.com.- 🦺 Several common misconfigurations in Games Settings are now prevented or corrected
      - The iRacing UI/launcher is replaced with the game
      - The Elite Dangerous launcher is replaced with the game
      - Some common tools are automatically removed from the games list and can't be re-added; adding something that is not a game to the games list is never beneficial in any way, and can cause severe performance and reliability issues
  - 🐛 Fixed a memory leak when enumerating processes
  - 🐛 Fixed crash if OpenKneeboard is waiting for certain kinds of events, and the waiting is cancelled at the same time the event occurs
  - 🐛 Fixed crash if a folder page source is removed at the same time the contents of the folder is modified
  - 🔊 Replaced 'SteamVR' with 'OpenVR' in renderers.txt in debug logs
  - 🔊 renderers.txt in the debug logs now contains the current and most recent game
  - 🔊 added more tracing for the Lua API
