ReleaseNotes: |-
  Start by downloading OpenKneeboard-v1.8.12.msi; the documentation is on OpenKneeboard.com.- 🐛 If OpenKneeboard is launched elevated and configured to relaunch without elevation, but it is still elevated afterwards, it will now log a failure rather than freeze
  - 🦺 The autoupdater will now show a warning if the new version is a development/test version
  - 🦺 v1.8 will delete a registry value used by v1.9+ to detect if a new backup is needed; this will cause v1.9+ to create a new settings backup if you downgrade to v1.8 then upgrade again, rather than just the first time you run a v1.9+ version
  - 📝 Debug logs now include the active OpenXR runtime if there is one, even if the list of installed/available runtimes is empty; it is possible for a runtime that is not in the list to be active, and this is common for older OpenXR runtimes
  - 📝 Debug logs now include the command line arguments when OpenKneeboard is started
