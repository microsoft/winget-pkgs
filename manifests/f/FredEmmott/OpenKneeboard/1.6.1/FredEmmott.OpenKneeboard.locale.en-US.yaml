ShortDescription: A tool for notes and reference information in flight simulators (VR and non-VR)
ReleaseNotes: |-
  - fixes an issue introduced in v1.6.0 where content could appear out of place and undersized on high-DPI screens (e.g. 4k); this only affected the OpenKneeboard app window, not in-game.
  - can increase the visual quality of content in the app window on high-DPI screens compared to v1.5 and below; the effect depends on the specific content being shown.
  - fixes a bug leading to poor performance of the OpenKneeboard app when it is the active window and a window capture is in progress
  - adds support for cropping captured windows to the 'client area'; this is the area excluding the classic Windows title bar, menu bar, and window frame.
    This feature will not work with apps with a non-standard title bar.
  - added an option to capture the Windows mouse cursor; as OpenKneeboard's tablet input does not move the Windows mouse cursor, tablet input will not result in a visible or captured Windows mouse cursor.
  - updates to the latest version of the Windows App SDK
