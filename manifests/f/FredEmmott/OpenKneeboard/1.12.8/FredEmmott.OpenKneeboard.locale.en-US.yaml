ReleaseNotes: |-
  - 🗑️ Removed the "UAC was previously disabled" warning; this was present because of common third-party issues that affected OpenKneeboard, but have since been fixed by the third-parties. More general problems remain if the system permissions are broken, but it no longer seems common enough to be worth having this extra message. I am likely to re-add it if this becomes a common problem again
  - 🐛 Prevent hang or extremely large file creation on some corrupted trk/miz files
  - 🐛 Don't crash when creating the debug log zips if your windows user doesn't have permission to check if a particular OpenXR API layer exists
  - 🔊 Add a dedicated error message if Direct3D is unavailable
