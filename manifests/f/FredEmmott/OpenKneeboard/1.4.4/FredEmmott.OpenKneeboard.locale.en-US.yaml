ShortDescription: A tool for notes and reference information in flight simulators (VR and non-VR)
ReleaseNotes: |-
  - fixes enabling/disabling double-buffering for Varjo+OpenXR+D3D12 under Settings -> Advanced -> Quirks.
    Previously the option in the UI did not actually change the setting.
  - fixes capturing of windows when they are un-minimized
  - fixes tabs not updating at the expected framerate if the tab list has been changed or reordered; this was especially noticeable for window capture tabs
  - adds an option in tab settings to not require that the window 'class' (type) matches; this option can remove the need to remove and re-add the capture tab every time the captured window is shown/hidden or the captured app is restarted
  - switch default to matching window title and not matching window class when capturing WPF windows, such as SimHub
