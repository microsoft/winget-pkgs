ReleaseNotes: |-
  Before installing: this might not be the latest release - you can always get the latest release here
  Start by downloading OpenKneeboard-v1.10.2.msi; the documentation is on OpenKneeboard.com.For changes between v1.8 and v1.10, see the announcement for v1.10.0Bug Fixes
  - 🐛 web dashboards and plugins: fixed crash if a tab uses OpenKneeboard's page navigation, and multiple views are active
  - 🐛 window capture tabs: fixed crash if 'capture client area' is turned on and the client area is 0px wide or 0px tall
  - 🐛 window capture tabs: if a matching window is minimized when OpenKneeboard is started, it will be captured when it is unminimized
  - 🐛 window capture tabs: fixed calculation of client area
  - 🐛 fix crash if headers are enabled but there is not enough space to render the header
  - 🔊 crash OpenKneeboard (not the game) immediately if there is an unrecoverable error in the frame loop; prior versions would stop updating until OpenKneeboard is restarted, and crash on exit. This makes it easier to see what causes the issue ("it crashes when I do thing"), and provides more useful debugging data
