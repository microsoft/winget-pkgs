ReleaseNotes: |-
  Before installing: this might not be the latest release - you can always get the latest release here
  Start by downloading OpenKneeboard-v1.10.12.msi; the documentation is on OpenKneeboard.com.Changes in v1.10.12
  - üêõ Fix crash if DCS mission name ends with a space (#774); this has recently became a common problem with the campaign "The Serpent's Head"
  - üêõ Fixed 'go to bindings' button in VR settings
  - üîá Fixed log spam if a game is added to the game's list, but the game's anti-cheat prevents OpenKneeboard from inspecting it. OpenXR games do not usually need to be added to OpenKneeboard's games list
