ShortDescription: A tool for notes and reference information in flight simulators (VR and non-VR)
ReleaseNotes: |-
  - fixed OpenKneeboard reloading modified files too quickly and showing [empty file]
  - OpenKneeboard now closes itself properly if it's open when logging out/shutting down/restarting Windows; no longer shows "Would you like to report a crash?" afterwards.
  - OpenKneeboard now records which OpenKneeboard updates are installed and when, and includes this information in the debug information created with Help -> 'Save As...'; this is to help troubleshoot "since I updated..." issues in the future.
