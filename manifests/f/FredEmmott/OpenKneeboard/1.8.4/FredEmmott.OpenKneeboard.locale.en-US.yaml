ReleaseNotes: |-
  Start by downloading OpenKneeboard-v1.8.4.msi; the documentation is on OpenKneeboard.com.Improvements
  - Added path mapping for DCS F-4E
  - Added a note that a 'cross' by a path in the debug information for DCS paths does not indicate an error, just that the folder does not exist
  - Relabeled "Oculus" and "SteamVR" to "Legacy Oculus" and "Legacy SteamVR" in game settings to match VR settings
  - The installation path is now recorded in the registry under HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Fred Emmott\OpenKneeboard\InstallationBinPath; this can be used to locate OpenKneeboard's API DLLs.
  Bugfixes
  - Fixed a crash when attempting to load corrupted PDF files
  - Fix rare crash or failure to load PDFs depending on system-specific timing
  - OpenXR API layer information in debug logs now correctly handles (and indicates) if there are invalid registry values, i.e. not DWORDs
  - Fixed rendering sometimes stalling or exceptions being raised due to ordering issues when rendering to cache and rendering from the same cache (switching the same resource between a shader resource and a render target)
  - Updated Windows App SDK to v1.5.4; this may improve cursor click handling in Web Dashboard tabs, and various other app issues
