ReleaseNotes: |-
  Start by downloading OpenKneeboard-v1.8.10.msi; the documentation is on OpenKneeboard.com.Changes
  This release unfortunately disables functionality that is affected by crash-causing bugs in other software.webp images
  Microsoft's "Webp Image Extensions" component is no longer used if installed, due to a bug in it that can crash OpenKneeboard. On most systems, this will mean that OpenKneeboard no longer supports webp images.Workaround: unfortunately, you need to convert any webp images you use with OpenKneeboard to another format, such as png images.Tablets
  Untrusted WinTab drivers
  WinTab can no longer be enabled if wintab32.dll does not have a signature that Windows trusts.- Gaomon, Huion, and Wacom ARE NOT affected
  - XP-Pen tablets ARE affected
  This is for several reasons:- unsigned DLLs can cause game crashes in games with anti-cheat if WinTab mode is set to 'invasive'
  - XP-Pen's wintab32.dll does not provide a way to identify it, and causes intermittent crashes both in games and OpenKneeboard
  Future versions of OpenKneeboard may ignore specific drivers known to cause crashes, but this change is still needed, and is sufficient to block XP-Pen's drivers.Workaround: use OpenTabletDriver instead if you have an affected tablet. OpenTabletDriver is recommended but not required for other tablets.If you are switching to OpenTabletDriver, you must uninstall your manufacturer's drivers; TabletDriverCleanup can be a useful tool.It is NOT possible to resolve this issue by:- telling WIndows to trust XP-Pen's wintab32.dll; this requires a code signing certificate, and would not fix the underlying crash-causing bugs
  - using a different manufacturer's wintab32.dll
  WinTab and OpenTabletDriver
  WinTab support can no longer be enabled at the same time as OpenTabletDriver. While there are known bugs caused by having both enabled, if OpenTabletDriver is enabled, there is no need for WinTab, so it is no longer possible to load both at the same time. Loading less code means less chance for bugs.
