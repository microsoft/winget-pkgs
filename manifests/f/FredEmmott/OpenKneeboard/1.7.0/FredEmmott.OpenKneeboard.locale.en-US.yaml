ReleaseNotes: |-
  Before installing: this might not be the latest release - you can always get the latest release here
  Start by downloading OpenKneeboard-v1.7.0.msi; the documentation is on OpenKneeboard.com.While OpenKneeboard is primarily intended for flight simulators, this release contains several new features that have been frequently requested by the sim racing community, which are also more broadly useful. It also contains performance improvements, especially for D3D12, Vulkan, and Varjo users, and especially when using multiple views.Sim-racing features
  - added 'Web Dashboard' tab type; this is intended for use with SimHub dashboard 'OBS links'; 'slots' or other links also work, however transparency requires OBS links
  - when used for SimHub dashboards, 'Web Dashboard' tabs will automatically resize to fit the SimHub dashboard
  - the 'dual kneeboards' advanced setting has been replaced with up to 16 views (depending on the game) configurable from VR settings; each view can show different content
  - all 16 views can be positioned independently; for those who want the old 'dual kneeboards' behavior, any view's position can optionally be set to mirror the position of any other view
  - added 'default tab' option for each view
  - OpenKneeboard's in-game UI (header, footer, bookmarks sidebar) can now be turned on/off for each view
  - Wildcards are now supported for window capture executable paths
  - When adding a new window capture tab for an Electron app such as Racelab or Discord, the version number in the path is automatically replaced with a wildcard; this removes the need to recreate or update the tab when the app being captured is updated
  - "Match Window Title" is automatically set to "Exact" when capturing a Racelab window
  Incompatible changes
  - The 'switch kneeboards' binding/remote has been replaced by separate 'swap first two views' and 'cycle active views'.
  - Mouse buttons can no longer be bound by default, due to frequent issues with accidental bindings; binding mouse buttons can be enabled from advanced settings
  - It is no longer possible to bind the left mouse button or the escape key, due to frequently being accidentally bound while trying to click 'Cancel'
  Other improvements
  - Completely rewritten in-game rendering; this improves performance for all renderers (D3D11, D3D12, and Vulkan), especially with multiple kneeboards, and removes the need for Varjo-specific D3D12 behavior. Varjo+OpenXR+D3D12 is now as fast as OpenXR+D3D12 on other headsets
  - The OpenXR Vulkan support has been fixed, but requires that games use XR_KHR_vulkan_enable2 instead of XR_KHR_vulkan_enable; OpenKneeboard will not be visible in  OpenXR games that use the legacy XR_KHR_vulkan_enable extension
  - Legacy SteamVR overlay support is automatically temporarily disabled while an OpenXR game is running
  - Added option to upscale under OpenXR; this is on by default for Varjo, and off-by-default for other headsets. Runtimes are theoretically able to upscale more optimally than OpenKneeboard can. This option should be left off or on automatic unless it is shows a significant improvement on your headset.
  - The font size for plain text pages can now be changed from advanced settings
  - Improved color handling for HDR window captures
  - Improved compatibility with the HTC Vive OpenXR runtime; this does not affect older Vive headsets that require SteamVR
  - Improved Oculus and Non-VR compatibility under slightly-restricted Windows user accounts
  - Improved visual quality of fixed-size images
  - Improved non-VR render quality
  - Improved handling of hotplugged input devices
  - Improved handling of invalid/corrupted JSON settings files
  - Improved performance of show/hide
  - Improved performance of PDF navigation
  - Improved performance when multiple views are showing the same file (not necessarily the same page)
  - Improved PDF hyperlink and table-of-contents compatibility for PDFs produced with Adobe FrameMaker or LaTeX
  - Non-VR: if the Steam (not SteamVR) overlay is present, auto-detect will attempt to render OpenKneeboard even if Direct3D components have been replaced (e.g. Reshade), by hooking the Steam overlay instead of Direct3D itself
  - Added very visible warnings about elevated programs; despite being the first entry in the troubleshooting guide, this is still the most common source of problems
  - The in-game buttons are no longer shown unless a graphics tablet is connected, as they can only be interacted with via a graphics tablet
  - Added alternative indicators of current page pin state and active view when a tablet is not connected
  - Reduced VRAM usage for tabs that have their own cursor handling, such as PDFs
  - Capped Window Capture framerate at OpenKneeboard's own internal framerate
  - Debug log now includes when the various renderers were last active
  - Debug log now includes UAC settings
  - Fixed crash if a PDF is replaced while it's open by Windows 11 Print-to-PDF
  - Fixed OpenTabletDriver dropouts when under heavy load, e.g. when loading PDF navigation
  - Fixed 'jumpy' clock
  - Reduced CPU overhead of enumerating processes while looking for games
  - OpenKneeboard's window will no longer open in the same position it was when closed if that position is not visible on any currently connected/active monitor.
  - It is now possible to correct the paths used for new DCS aircraft when OpenKneeboard is not yet aware of them; see https://openkneeboard.com/troubleshooting/dcs-tabs.html#the-path-is-incorrect-for-some-aircraft
  - OpenKneeboard now exits faster
  - OpenKneeboard-Viewer now supports D3D11, D3D12, or Vulkan; use -G D3D12 for example to switch.
  Changes since v1.7-beta2
  - Fixed some debug spam
  - Added alternative indicators of current page pin state and active view when a tablet is not connected
  - Clearer debug logging when an injected DLL is not in the process module list
  - Log tab changes, including default tab settings
  - Match window title by default when adding Racelab window capture tabs
  - Automatically replace version number in path with * when capturing Electron apps, e.g. Discord and Racelab
