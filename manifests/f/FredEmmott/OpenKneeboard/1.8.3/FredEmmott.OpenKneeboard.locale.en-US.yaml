ReleaseNotes: |-
  Start by downloading OpenKneeboard-v1.8.3.msi; the documentation is on OpenKneeboard.com.Bug Fixes
  - Fix accumulation of rounding errors which could lead to game OpenXR errors with specific combinations of content sizes when headers/footers were disabled
  - Update the Windows App SDK to v1.5.3; this fixes a bug that could lead to OpenKneeboard inappropriately becoming the active window
  - Fix DirectInput bindings from profiles not being loaded when switching profiles
  - Tint/brightness are applied when using the legacy SteamVR API (OpenVR)
  Other enhancements
  - The viewer window title will now include the view number if showing a view other than the first. This is to make it possible to capture multiple viewers in tools like OBS.
