ReleaseNotes: |-
  Start by downloading OpenKneeboard-v1.8.2.msi; the documentation is on OpenKneeboard.com.Bug fixes
  - Fix rare OpenKneeboard app crash when using OpenTabletDriver
  - Fix OpenKneeboard app crash when attempting to enable tablet mouse emulation for windows captured from 32-bit applications such as vPilot
  - 'Would you like to report a crash?' pop-up is no longer shown if OpenKneeboard was closed due to logging out of/shutting down/rebooting Windows
  - Window class is now ignored by default for captured windows built using Windows Forms, such as vPilot
  - DCS: Fix missing content for multiplayer servers that are not dedicated servers
  - DCS: Fix incorrect installation paths for the AH-64D; this fixes misleading indicators in the debug information, however, as the built-in kneeboard pages are Lua, OpenKneeboard remains unable to display them
