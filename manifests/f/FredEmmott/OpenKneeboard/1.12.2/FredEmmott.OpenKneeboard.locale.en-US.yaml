ReleaseNotes: |-
  Start by downloading OpenKneeboard-v1.12.2.msi; the documentation is on OpenKneeboard.com.Changes
  - ✨ Web dashboard tabs now have the ability to disable OpenKneeboard extensions/integrations. This is a workaround for web pages with buggy integrations
  - 🐛 Fix OpenKneeboard intermittently switching tabs the moment tab settings are changed; if a settings popup was still open, this could lead to the app window becoming greyed out and unusable
  - 🔊 More detailed debug logging for monitors, including which GPU they are connected to
  - 🔊 Log OpenXR application and engine information
  - 📄 Relicensed: projects derived from OpenKneeboard must change the name and unique identifiers to reduce confusion and technical conflicts
  - 🔥 Remove RELOAD_CURRENT_TAB remote control/API, as a courtesy to the original contributor. I was unable to reach the original author when proposing the license change.
