ReleaseNotes: |-
  Before installing: this might not be the latest release - you can always get the latest release here
  Start by downloading OpenKneeboard-v1.7.1.msi; the documentation is on OpenKneeboard.com.- OpenXR: OpenKneeboard will no longer consider errors submitting frames to be fatal, and will instead pass the error to the game; the games' response will then vary. This may fix an issue where MSFS ocassionally crashes when recentering shortly after enabling VR.
  - When adding multiple file/folder tabs, the selection dialog will re-open at the same folder as the last file/folder that was added
  - Relabelled "SteamVR support" to "Legacy SteamVR support (OpenVR)"
  - Log which GPU is recommended by the SteamVR runtime
  - Log which GPU captured windows are running on
