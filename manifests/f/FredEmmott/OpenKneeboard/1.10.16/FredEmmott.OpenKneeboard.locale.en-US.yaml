ReleaseNotes: |-
  Before installing: this might not be the latest release - you can always get the latest release here
  Start by downloading OpenKneeboard-v1.10.16.msi; the documentation is on OpenKneeboard.com.- üêõ Fix window capture tabs being blank or not updating on Windows 11 24H2
      - previous versions of Windows (including earlier versions of Windows 11) have a performance issue where Windows constantly says that captured windows have a new frame, even if nothing's changed. OpenKneeboard accidentally depended on this bug
  - üîáStop writing entries in the DCS World log that have turned out to be misleading to people investigating unrelated DCS startup or OpenXR issues
