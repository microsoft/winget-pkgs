ReleaseNotes: |-
  Start by downloading OpenKneeboard-v1.12.0.msi; the documentation is on OpenKneeboard.com.- 🐛 Fix crash if > 16 views are added; added limit to UI
  - 🐛 Fix crash if user doesn't have permission to see if their own Saved Games folder exists
  - 🐛 Fix crash if user doesn't have permission to read/write to their own LOCALAPPDATA folder
  - 💥 OpenKneeboard can no longer be ran as Administrator, or with User Account Control (UAC) turned off
      - this is related to the previous 2 crash fixes
      - the previous warnings were extremely obtrusive, but still widely ignored
      - it is relatively common for people to try running it as administrator just once 'to see if it fixes things'; like most Windows software released since Windows Vista, even running it as admin 'just once' is much more likely to cause problems - including problems that can not reasonably be fixed except by reinstalling windows - than fix them.
      - I will not reconsider this change
  - 🔊 Added a warning if UAC was previously enabled
      - This ties into the previous 2 crash fixes, and several reports of issues in other related software and driver caused by disabling UAC
      - Similar to the previous UAC/Administrator warnings, it is still possible to start OpenKneeboard with this warning. If they are similarly ignored, it will become a hard error in the future
      - I will not reconsider this change
