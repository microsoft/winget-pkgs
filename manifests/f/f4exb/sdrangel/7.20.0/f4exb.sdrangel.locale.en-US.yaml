ReleaseNotes: |-
  This new feature is introduced by @srcejon The purpose of this feature is to detect Sudden Ionospheric Disturbances (SID) due to solar activity and that can be observed by monitoring several VLF transmitters. More information hereA "FT" mode has been added to the ChirpChat modulator and demodulator. It uses the same protocol as FT8 (or FT4) to encode 174 bits with CRC and FEC. Then instead of using a 8-FSK modulation it will use chirp symbols to put the message on the air. It is quite different from the original FT8 however since the bandwidth is significantly larger (minimum 375 Hz) and only one transmission is decoded at a time. However since it uses the chirp synchronization sequence at the start of the transmission it is not tied to the clock. Long distance transmissions have been experimented on HF with a websdr on the Rx side. Due to the relative small bandwidth and slow transmission it is important that there is a minimal clock drift. With websds using the browser as the audio source there is usually a small drift to compensate the clock skew between the web site and the audio device on the computer. This results in possible message loss although the signal is still quite visible on the spectrogram. When using a SDR receiver directly this should not happen.- Removed unused includes and use more direct includes. PR #2062 from @dforsi
