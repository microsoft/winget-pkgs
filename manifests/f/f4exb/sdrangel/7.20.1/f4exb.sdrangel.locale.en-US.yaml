ReleaseNotes: |-
  Following #2089 more functionality added to the Interferometer plugin so that it has now a gain adjustment control in addition to phase difference control. Also it now has the possibility to send the correlated I/Q samples to a Local Input device to be further processed in a source (Rx) stream. Primary purpose is to support noise suppression using two synchronized Rx streams (thus coming from a MIMO device with 2 coherent channels) by connecting these Rx inputs to two different antennas similarly to what is done in SDRuno with a SDRduo device. For now tested successfully on a Red Pitaya in Metis mode (Pavel Demin's firmware) using the Metis MISO plugin.
