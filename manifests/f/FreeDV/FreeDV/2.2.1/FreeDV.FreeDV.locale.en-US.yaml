ShortDescription: Open Source Amateur Digital Voice mode for HF radio.
Description: |-
  FreeDV is a suite of digital voice modes for HF radio. Our flagship mode is the Radio Autoencoder (RADE). You can run RADE using a free GUI application for Windows, Linux and macOS that allows any SSB radio to be used for high quality digital voice.
  FreeDV technology is being developed by an international team of radio amateurs working together on Machine Learning, DSP, coding, design, user interface and testing. The project is managed by a 6 person Project Leadership Team (PLT). Current development is being generously funded by an ADRC grant and our Financial Sponsor is the Software Freedom Conservancy. All software is open source, released under the (a) GNU Lesser Public License version 2.1 (GUI and legacy FreeDV modes) and two-clause BSD license (RADE).
