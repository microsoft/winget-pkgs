Description: |-
  VX Search is an automated, rule-based file search solution allowing one to search files by the file type, category, extension, file name, file size, location, creation, modification and last access dates, regular expressions, user name, file attributes, binary and text patterns, JPEG EXIF tags, etc.

  The user is provided with the ability to categorize and filter file search results, perform file management operations, generate various types of pie and bars charts, save reports to a number of standard formats such as HTML, PDF, Excel, text, CSV, XML and export search results to an SQL database.

  IT administrators are provided with advanced file search capabilities including the ability to search files in multiple servers and/or NAS storage devices simultaneously, periodic file search operations, automatic report generation, conditional file search actions allowing one to send E-Mail notifications and/or execute custom commands when a file search operation finds a user-specified number of files.

  In addition to the VX Search GUI application, the user is provided with a command line utility, which can be used to execute pre-configured file search operations and integrated into user-custom shell scripts and batch files. The VX Search command line utility may be used to execute file search operations locally or control file search operations in one or more VX Search Servers via the network.
