  DupScout is a duplicate files search and removal solution allowing one to search duplicate files in disks, directories, network shares or NAS storage devices. The user is provided with the ability to review detected duplicate files, generate reports, replace duplicate files with shortcuts or hard links, move duplicate files to another directory, compress and move duplicates or delete all duplicate files.

  DupScout allows one to save HTML, PDF, Excel, text, CSV and XML reports. Advanced users are provided with the ability to export reports from multiple servers to a centralized SQL database and perform history trend analysis operations.
