Description: |-
  DiskSorter is a file classification solution allowing one to classify files in local disks, network shares, NAS devices and enterprise storage systems.
  Users are provided with the ability to gain an in-depth visibility into which types of files are using most of the disk space, save reports and perform file management operations on categories of files.

  DiskSorter provides a number of built-in file classification plugins capable of recognizing more than 3,000 types of files and allowing one to classify files by the file type, extension, user name, creation, last modification and last access dates, etc.
  Users are provided with the ability to generate various types of pie charts, categorize and filter file classification results and save file classification reports into a number of standard formats including HTML, PDF, Excel, text, CSV, JSON, XML and the DiskSorter native report format.

  IT and storage administrators are provided with the ability to submit file classification reports from multiple servers and NAS storage devices to a centralized SQL database and analyze disk space usage history trends for one or more file categories per server and/or per user across the entire enterprise.
