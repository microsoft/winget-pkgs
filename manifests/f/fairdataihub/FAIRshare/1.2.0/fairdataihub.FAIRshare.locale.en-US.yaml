ShortDescription: Simplifying data curation for researchers working on COVID-19 research
Description: FAIRshare is a cross-platform desktop software that allows researchers to easily organize and share their biomedical research data according to applicable FAIR guidelines. In our first phase of development we are implementing a process for making biomedical research software FAIR and also working on supporting the FAIRification of COVID-19 and other infectious disease related research data (immunology, genomics, epidemiology, etc.). Learn more about FAIRshare, its impact, the development timeline, and related resources on our group's website at https://fairdataihub.org/fairshare.
