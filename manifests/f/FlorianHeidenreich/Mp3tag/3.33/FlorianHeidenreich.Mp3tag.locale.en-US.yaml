ShortDescription: The universal tag editor and more...
Description: |-
  Mp3tag is a powerful and easy-to-use tool to edit metadata of audio files.
  It supports batch tag-editing of ID3v1, ID3v2.3, ID3v2.4, iTunes MP4, WMA, Vorbis Comments and APE Tags for multiple files at once covering a variety of audio formats.
  Furthermore, it supports online database lookups from, e.g., Discogs, MusicBrainz or freedb, allowing you to automatically gather proper tags and download cover art for your music library.
  You can rename files based on the tag information, replace characters or words in tags and filenames, import/export tag information, create playlists and more.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  FIX: drag and drop from other applications did not work in some cases (since v3.32). (#70532)

  CHG: adding cover art using 'Manage covers...' now opens the same folder as adding cover art via the Tag Panel context menu.

  FIX: writing MP4 tags to specific fragmented/streaming MP4 files is no longer refused.
  FIX: writing MP4 tags to specific fragmented/streaming MP4 files corrupted the file and now simply refuses to tag the file.
  CHG: auto-completion of custom values when editing in File List and Extended Tags is now only enabled if custom values exist for the field. (#70251)
  CHG: function `json_select_array` of Web Sources Framework now supports JSON arrays as unnamed root element. (#70274)
