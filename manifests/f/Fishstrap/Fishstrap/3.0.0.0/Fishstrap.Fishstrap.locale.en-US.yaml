ReleaseNotes: |-
  GitHub Downloads (all assets, specific tag)
  This version primarily addresses Roblox's removal of Fast Flags. Currently, Roblox has removed the ability to set any Fast Flag of your choice. Instead, you are only allowed to use certain Flags approved by Roblox themselves.
  Caution
  ATTEMPTING TO BYPASS THESE RESTRICTIONS WILL GET YOU BANNED FROM ROBLOX. DO NOT ASK FOR BYPASSES.
  Additions
  Global Settings Page
  To lessen the impact of losing a significant number of settings, we have implemented a settings page for GlobalBasicsSettings, allowing you to edit a limited number of settings. These settings are currently allowed to be edited and will not result in a ban or suspension.
  Custom Fishstrap Invites
  Due to numerous requests (and my personal annoyance), we have implemented a custom deeplink feature, allowing you to invite people to your server with just one custom fishstrap.app link. There's no need to paste the deeplink into the run box anymore - now you can click a single link and join your friends.

  Better Server Info
  We have now switched to using an API for fetching server info. This should result in much more accurate server information than before.
  Remote Configuration
  This will allow us to update Fishstrap's settings without needing to make a new release every time, saving significant time and work.
  Fixes
  - Added missing strings
  - Fixed Studio not launching
  - Fixed executable showing up as "Bloxstrap"
  - Fixed some backend issues; no user-side code was changed
  Removals
  - Removed a majority of the FFlag presets due to the reasons mentioned above. You can only use the editor for Studio now.
