ReleaseNotes: |-
  GitHub Downloads
  This release backports fixes from PR #925. In addition, we fixed the singleton mutex check (by replacing it with a check for existing processes) and nuked the ability to modify .mesh files.
  Additions
  - Added a check to skip .mesh files
  Changes
  We modified the workflow again, and this time you will see Fishstrap.exe attached in the assets. Removal of the version tag allows us to fetch latest releases for our official website, https://fishstrap.app.
  Fixes
  - Fixed CleanupVersionsFolder() and TryDeleteRobloxInDirectory() methods
  - Fixed a check for singleton mutex, it'll look for existing processes instead
