  Fishstrap Version 2.9.2.1
  GitHub Downloads (all assets, specific tag)
  Hello! I finally remembered my password and resumed development. I definitely didn't procrastinate for like two months...
  We've finally updated to the latest version of Bloxstrap. We won't be discussing features that Bloxstrap implemented here; please refer to the Bloxstrap patch notes if you need that information.
  Additions
  Upgrades to Custom Integrations
  We've introduced new upgrades to custom integrations! You can now specify if you want your integration to launch before Roblox starts. Normally, integrations launch after Roblox does, but with this option enabled, it will launch beforehand. You can also specify a delay for when Roblox launches.
  Log Cleaner
  Tired of Roblox/Fishstrap logs hogging up space? Now you can clear them without needing to do anything! You can specify how often logs are cleared and which files to clear. This feature is for that person who had over 10 gigabytes in Roblox logs and cache files (I don't know who, since bloodrvn accidentally deleted the suggestions channel like an idiot...).
  Improvements to Custom Bootstrappers
  Alongside the improvements and features added by Bloxstrap, we've also increased the maximum width of the bootstrapper window.
  Tweaked Some Registry Keys
  This shouldn't affect your install; it's just something we're preparing for.
  Winget Support
  You should now be able to install Fishstrap through Winget. Thank you, @UltimatePlayer97, for the PR!
  Fixes
  - Fixed the menu breaking when you changed the theme in the Appearance menu. (This one is my fault. Sorry!)
  - Fixed the download status. It should now actually show the correct size of the package being downloaded.
  - Fixed the 403 error when downloading from a channel.
  - Thank you, @Naveandice, for fixing the workflow... again!
  - And some other bug fixes I can't remember.
