ShortDescription: Markdown-Oxide is a Personal Knowledge Management System(PKM) that composes with your favorite text-editor through the Language Server Protocol(LSP)
Description: |-
  Markdown-Oxide is a Personal Knowledge Management System(PKM) that composes with your favorite text-editor through the Language Server Protocol(LSP).

  While other PKMs implement their own text-editors, markdown-oxide is unbundled: it leaves text-editing to a dedicated text-editor and focuses solely on robust, performant knowledge management.

  It also is inspired by and highly compatible with Obsidian.

  Editor Support:

  - The best-supported text editor is Neovim, but also popular with users are VSCode, Helix, and Zed.

  - Markdown Oxide will work with any text editor implementing the Language Server Protocol, but support for features will depend on the extent to which the editor implements the LSP.

  Markdown-oxide is for you if:

  - You have a favorite text editor -- possibly one that you have spent days configuring and cannot live without -- and it supports the LSP.
  - Your set of Personal Knowledge Management needs can be met by Markdown-oxide.
