ReleaseNotes: |-
  Changelog:
  - Added 'Limit Defender CPU Usage'
  - Added a search bar to easily search the apps to install (thanks to @JVKeller for the suggestion)
  The desktop app may be flagged as a threat by Windows Defender; however, this is a false positive. This occurs because the scripts you create with WinScript can modify system settings. Rest assured, WinScript is safe, transparent, and open-source.
