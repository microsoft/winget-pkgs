ReleaseNotes: |-
  - The "Move to Folder" menu action allows you to press Tab or the "→" key to complete the name of the highlighted folder, which makes it easier to complete a path in long folder hierarchies.
  - Mailspring now properly identifies and formats quoted text from Yahoo and AOL email. (Thanks @nzayatz14)
  - On MacOS, the Mailspring icon in the dock now allows you to compose a new message from the context menu. (thanks @Naroh091)
  - Mailspring's menu bar icon is now red for new mail and blue for unread mail, which makes it easier to spot a new message that needs attention. (#2433, thanks @marivaldojr)
  - Contact sync no longer crashes when a contact has no display name (thanks @ww-daniel-mora)
  - The help menu now offers the standard MacOS "menu search" feature (Thanks @probablykasper)
  - Colons are allowed in URLs and no longer break Mailspring's link highlighting. (thanks @choptastic!)
  - The email preview is no longer in some cases in vertical layout (thanks @glenn2223!)
  - Updated Italian translations (thanks @andy00087!)
  - Mailspring now uses a more restrictive Content-Security-Policy that includes object-src none; media-src mailspring:; manifest-src none;.
    If your plugin packaged media such as sounds, you may need to reference them via the mailspring:// URL syntax (ala 2b75347c)
