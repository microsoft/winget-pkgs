ReleaseNotes: |-
  Features:
  - Grammar check is now available in the composer! (#2612)
    - This feature relies on a deployment of LanguageTool at id.getmailspring.com - when you use Grammar Check, small snippets of your draft are sent to this server, but the requests are not logged and no message data is stored.
    - This feature is disabled by default. To turn it on, click the new icon in the composer toolbar.
  - Mailspring now properly detects "Do Not Disturb" status on MacOS Sequoia and on Windows.
  Bug Fixes:
  - On Wayland, the --background flag now shows the main window briefly then hides it, which is the best we can do under Wayland's rules. (#2623)
  - On Wayland, fixed a keyboard freeze in the composer caused by a double focus() call. (#2622)
  - Fixed sound notifications playing on Windows regardless of the notification preference. (#2619)
  - Fixed the tray icon theme detection on GNOME/Unity Linux desktops. (#2610)
  - Fixed a crash in vCard parsing when the VERSION line is not found.
  - Fixed an issue with the first CardDAV sync incorrectly seeing existing ETags in mailsync.
  - Fixed IMAP IDLE to process VANISHED notifications sent by FastMail (and possibly other providers).
  - Fixed folder priority logic that was incorrectly applied to non-iCloud accounts in mailsync.
  Improvements:
  - Added support for the stnadard biographies / notes field on contacts. (#2621)
  - Rearranged the thread context menu to reduce accidental destructive actions. (#2620)
  - Added an empty state to the calendar when no CalDAV accounts are connected. (#2625)
  - The draft window now uses the message subject as the window title.
  - Improved read receipt tracking pixel reliability. (#2613)
  - Improved mail rules robustness and fixed condition evaluation bugs. (#2616)
  - Added VTIMEZONE to created calendar events so they are created on Yahoo in the correct timezone.
  - Enabled CalDAV discovery to support Fastmail, Yahoo, and other providers in the upcoming calendar.
  - On Windows, the app icon is now a rounded square to better fit with Windows 11 design guidelines.
  Developer:
  - Replaced CSS-based platform hiding with React conditionals in preferences. (#2614)
  - Removed subpixel-antialiased font smoothing overrides. (#2618)
  - Added syncInit to main-calendar to eliminate a 2.5s startup delay. (#2606)
