ReleaseNotes: |-
  This version of Mailspring includes several changes and bug fixes, as well as an update to our Electron core.
  - Mailspring now connects to Outlook accounts using OAuth, resolving connection issues for Hotmail, Outlook and some Office 365 accounts.
  - The autoconfig database used to identify your IMAP and SMTP settings automatically has been upgraded to reflect changes in provider settings.
  - On Windows and Linux, previewing attachments is more robust and works with a wider variety of files. These attachments also have rendered previews in the message view.
  - Mailspring allows you to add Medium, GitHub and YouTube links to email signatures created in the app. (#2484) Thanks @sudeephazra!
  - Subject lines no longer overflow if they contain single long words (#2485) Thanks @probablykasper!
  - The Simplified Chinese translations have been improved - thanks @qiuzhiqian!
  Developer:
  - Mailspring now uses Electron 30, a recent supported release based on Chromium M124 - thanks to @Phylu for lots of PRs and manual testing that helped us move up three years of versions (v17 => v30) in the last 12 months!
  - The Changelog now mentions security contributions by Positive Technologies, Payatu, and Sonar in v1.13.3.
  Note: This release does not fix ongoing issues with Gmail OAuth - we are working through Google's revised certification process for continued access to the Gmail API and expect it to be complete in the next two weeks. Thanks to everyone for your patience, their process changed this year.
