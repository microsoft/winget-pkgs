  üñºÔ∏è Gaussian Splatting improvements
  We have improved gaussian splatting support in F3D!
  You can now open .spz and .ply files along with the existing .splat support.
  Moreover, these new formats support spherical harmonics for high quality renders.

  üî¨ New scivis formats
  Scivis rendering has always been a big part of F3D userbase and we want to make sure we keep improving on that regard!
  You can now open VTKHDF (.vtkhdf) and NetCDF (.nc) in F3D.
  Also you can now open .usd file with embedded EXR textures.
