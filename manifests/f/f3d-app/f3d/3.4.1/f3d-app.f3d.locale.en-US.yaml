ShortDescription: F3D is a fast and minimalist 3D viewer desktop application
Description: F3D is a fast and minimalist 3D viewer desktop application. It supports many file formats, from digital content to scientific datasets (including glTF, USD, STL, STEP, PLY, OBJ, FBX, Alembic), can show animations and support thumbnails and many rendering and texturing options including real time physically based rendering and raytracing.

  🇨 C bindings
  The libf3d now have C bindings for complete intercompatibility
  with other languages:
  https://f3d.app/docs/next/libf3d/LANGUAGE_BINDINGS#c
  Here is a quick prototype of Julia binding that uses the libf3d C bindings:
  https://github.com/joa-quim/F3D.jl
  🔃 Complete examples
  We now have libf3d examples for:
  - C bindings
  - Python bindings
  - Java bindings
  - C++ bindings with multiple usecase
  - FLTK
  - Qt6
  - QML
  See how easy it is to create your own app using the libf3d!
    // Load static/native plugins
    f3d::engine::autoloadPlugins();
    // Create a native-window engine
    f3d::engine eng = f3d::engine::create();
    // Modify options using the struct API
    f3d::options& opt = eng.getOptions();
    opt.render.grid.enable = true;
    opt.render.show_edges = true;
    // UI overlays: axis + some HUD
    opt.ui.axis = true;
    opt.ui.fps = true;
    opt.ui.animation_progress = true;
    opt.ui.filename = true;
    // FXAA + tone mapping
    opt.render.effect.antialiasing.enable = true;
    opt.render.effect.antialiasing.mode = "fxaa";
    opt.render.effect.tone_mapping = true;
    ::AddCustomCommands(eng);
    ::AddCustomBindins(eng);
    try
    {
      // Add a model to the scene
      eng.getScene().add(file);
    }
    catch (const std::exception& e)
    {
      std::cerr << e.what() << '\n';
    }
    // Start interaction loop
    eng.getInteractor().start();
