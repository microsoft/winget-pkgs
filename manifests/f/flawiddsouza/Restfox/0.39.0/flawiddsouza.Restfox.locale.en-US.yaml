ReleaseNotes: |-
  What's New
  - Sidebar > Folder > environment quick switcher (resolves #312)
  - Add support for additional response formats in settings and response panel for bypassing binary response warning on custom content types (resolves #339)
  - Tabs in Settings
  Fixes
  - Import > use the same fetch logic as the rest of the app instead of directly using the fetch method to avoid CORS issues + import not respecting the disable ssl setting (resolves #330, resolves #336)
  - curl import fails for multipart/form-data (resolves #335) + auto focus the textarea when showing the curl import modal
  - Response Panel > remember & restore scroll position when switching tabs, not working correctly for responses that get a large response / binary response warning
  - Backup Restore failing for backups having request or response data larger than 10 MB (resolves #338)
