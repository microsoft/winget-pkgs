  🎁 New Features
  - New text editor 🎉 – I've replaced the old editor with a brand new one that has fewer bugs and enables new features like Step Links and Tables.
  - Step Links – Easily reference any step within a guide.
  - Tables 📝 – You can now add tables directly into the guide or step descriptions.
  - Right-click steps in the steps list to bulk-change their statuses.
  ⭐ Improvements
  - The "New Folder" button has been moved to the guides list, next to the search bar.
  - The NL locale was updated after another thorough proofreading by Jeffrey D.
  🔧 Bug Fixes
  - Fixed an issue on Windows where capturing would get stuck after hovering over the menu.
  - Resolved an issue where Word documents were sometimes corrupted due to invisible UTF characters.
  - Fixed a bug where the Online Guides UI was not loading for some users.
  - You can finally create lists that start with a number other than 1, and add new lines within existing lists. God bless the new text editor 🙏
