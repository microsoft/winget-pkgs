  # What's New in Local 9.2.5

  ## Updates

  - Updated WP-CLI to v2.12.0.
  - Updated Mailpit to v1.24.1.

  ## Fixes

  - Improved Ubuntu 24 and Fedora compatibility by bundling missing dependencies
    that are no longer included in latest Linux releases. Previously, this was
    causing issues installing Local and starting nginx on these operating systems.
  - Logging improvements to remove redundant or excessive log entries that cluttered
    log files and made it more difficult to track down problems.
  - Version bumps to several dependencies to pull in the latest security patches.
