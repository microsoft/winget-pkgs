ReleaseNotes: |-
  Polypane 26
  Polypane 26 brings the most accurate device emulation available anywhere. We now emulate small viewport units (svh) and device-specific safe area insets, two critical factors that affect every mobile layout but were impossible to emulate until now. This means layout bugs that previously only surfaced on real devices can now be caught and fixed fast during development. Full release notes.
