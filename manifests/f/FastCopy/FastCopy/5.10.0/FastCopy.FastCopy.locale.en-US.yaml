ShortDescription: The Fastest Copy/Backup Software on Windows
Description: |-
  FastCopy is the Fastest Copy/Backup Software on Windows.

  It supports UNICODE and over MAX_PATH (260 characters) file pathnames.

  It automatically selects different methods according to whether Source and DestDir are in the same or different HDD (or SSD).
  Diff HDD	Reading and writing are processed respectively in parallel by separate threads.
  Same HDD	Reading is processed until the big buffer fills. When the big buffer is filled, writing is started and processed in bulk.

  Reading/Writing are processed with no OS cache, so other applications do not become slow.
  It can achieve Reading/Writing performance that is close to the device limit.
  Include/Exclude Filter (UNIX Wildcard style) can be specified. ver3.0 or later, Relative Path can be specified.
  It runs fast and does not hog resources, because MFC is not used. (Designed using Win32 API and C Runtime only)

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Added "Move uses Move(No overwrite)" option in the Shell Extension settings. (Pro only)
  Improved write speed to FAT-based file systems(FAT16/FAT32/exFAT) when running with administrator privileges.
  With the "Move(No overwrite)" mode, if a file already exists in the DestDir, it is now treated as Error instead of Skip.
