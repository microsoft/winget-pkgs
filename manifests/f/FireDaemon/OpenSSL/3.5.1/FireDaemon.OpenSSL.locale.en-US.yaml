ShortDescription: OpenSSL Binary Distribution for Microsoft Windows by FireDaemon Technologies
Description: |-
  OpenSSL is a popular open-source, publicly available software library that provides a robust, full-featured set of cryptographic functions and tools to secure communications over computer networks. When we build and ship FireDaemon Certify One, FireDaemon Fusion, and FireDaemon Lozenge we try to ensure they contain the most recent version of OpenSSL. We thought it would be useful to make our OpenSSL Binary Distribution available to you to download and use free of charge. The key advantages of using our OpenSSL Binary Distribution for Microsoft Windows over others that are available are:
  - No need to deploy various software tools to attempt to compile the source from scratch. Our build script is available if you do want to compile OpenSSL yourself
  - No external dependencies. Installing or distributing the Visual C++ Redistributable Runtime (MSVC) is unnecessary. There is an implicit dependency on the Windows Universal C Runtime (UCRT), which is included by default in all modern versions of Microsoft Windows
  - Packaged for simple deployment and use case scenarios, including standalone, embeddable, deployable, or portable
  - Digitally signed with our Extended Validation (EV) code signing certificate to avoid Windows SmartScreen warnings and increase trust by Sectigo's authentication and verification procedures on us: FireDaemon Technologies Limited and validatable binary integrity to meet your compliance requirements.
