ShortDescription: A simple GUI for SCRCPY and other ADB functions
ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Compilation fixes
  (Because Nuxt2 is getting old, Vue wasn't installing properly via yarn. Vue2 had to be pinned at version 2.6.14 to proceed with development)
  - Remove changelog from within the app (refer to github releases for changelogs)
  - Bump SCRCPY to 2.3.1 from 2.3.0
  Additional notes: The future of SCRCPY+
  The flutter rewrite has been scrapped as I don't have much time to work on a complete rewrite. I'll be looking to porting the existing codebase to Vue3 from Nuxt2.
  I've also switched to Fedora Linux as my daily driver OS. Linux builds should become up to date sometime soon.
