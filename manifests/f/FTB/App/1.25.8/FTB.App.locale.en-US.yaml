  ðŸŽ‰ Added
      CurseForge mods will now have a "CurseForge" badge in the mod details that will take you to the mod page on the CurseForge website #716
  ðŸ”§ Changed
      All authentication methods now use the ftb:// protocol instead of a local web server. This should improve the reliability of the authentication process
      We now refresh your Minecraft Authentication token if it's within 6 hours of expiring to ensure you can continue to play your instances without interruption
      Improved the wording around the "Instance relocation system" so it is clear that this is a relocation process and not a just a settings value #1077
      Ram will now actually save if you change it via the input box #1024
      Ram values now show the correct ram calculation. Thanks to @bryce-schultz
      Hopefully fixed the app icon not working on linux machines #1098
      Some modpack names breaking the file path due to trailing spaces #1099
      Instances can now be relocated to basically anywhere instead of having safeguards around nested folders #1061 #1095
