ReleaseNotes: "A small release to build the release binaries with a more recent Go toolchain, and to fix a couple CLI edge cases ( The Go module now exposes a plugin package that provides an age plugin client. That is, Recipient and Identity implementations that invoke a plugin binary, allowing the use of age plugins in Go programs.Finally, Recipients can now return a set of \"labels\" by implementing RecipientWithLabels. This allows replicating the special behavior of the scrypt Recipient in third-party Recipients, or applying policy useful for authenticated or post-quantum Recipients.\n// RecipientWithLabels can be optionally implemented by a Recipient, in which\n// case Encrypt will use WrapWithLabels instead of Wrap.\n//\n// Encrypt will succeed only if the labels returned by all the recipients\n// (assuming the empty set for those that don't implement RecipientWithLabels)\n// are the same.\n//\n// This can be used to ensure a recipient is only used with other recipients\n// with equivalent properties (for example by setting a \"postquantum\" label) or\n// to ensure a recipient is always used alone (by returning a random label, for\n// example to preserve its authentication properties).\ntype RecipientWithLabels interface {\n\tWrapWithLabels(fileKey []byte) (s []*Stanza, labels []string, err error)\n}"
