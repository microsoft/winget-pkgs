ReleaseNotes: |-
  New features
  - Spectral Plots: Create spectral plots for selected detectors and populations.
  - Spectral Population Viewer: Comparing populations using spectral plots.
  - SpectralFX: Optimize spectral compensation matrices from spectral BD cytometers.
    - Known issue: SpectralFX will not work on data produce from BD FACSChorusTM 5.3 and beyond.
  - Advanced Scaling Preferences: Define data-driven per cytometer scaling defaults with as much nuance as you choose to add.
  - Cluster Explorer: Explore added functionality
    - Non-cluster populations can now be visualized in the cluster explorer
    - Clusters can be re-ordered within the heat map view
    - Heatmap columns can be re-ordered or hidden
    - Expanded heat map window
    - Coloring of cluster names in heatmap now corresponds to cluster colors
  - Table creation for MEM scores: Export MEM population names in a tabular format
  - Copy Transforms: In the compensation matrix editor users can now copy the transform from one compensation matrix to another, allowing per parameter transform type, width basis, ranges, etc. to be easily applied to another data set.
  - Hyperfinder: Recapitulate populations identified by a computational approach, as standard gates so that they might be sorted.
  - NxN plot parameter mouseover: Display parameter combinations on NxN plots for easier viewing.
  Improvements
  - The Java version inherent to FlowJo has been updated to Java 17, which improves security and resolution on high-resolution monitors.
  - Calculation speed issues on Windows have been resolved.
  - Navigation menus for data loading have been updated to display more file types.
  - Rectangular spectral matrices can now be included in export / concatenation operations.
  - Improved support for spectral compensation matrices from BD A5SE.
  - The Y-axis scale can now be set on kinetics plots in the layout editor, allowing for easier comparison across samples.
  - The Kinetics platform now handles the time parameter the same as the rest of the program, allowing for easier visualization and adjustment.
  - The BD CellViewTM Lens plugin now has improved integration with the BD Research Cloud
  - Negative numbers can now be entered into a compensation matrix.
  - Multiple gates can now be deleted simultaneously from a group.
  - Requirement to place any sample into a group with the role of ‘control’ has been relaxed for setting manually created gates as ‘control’ gates.
  - New bands have been created for Quad gates and Algorithms to provide for more granular control of ribbon contents and more intuitive groupings. Additionally, Compare Populations has been. moved to the Populations band and the Script Editor was moved to the Power band.
  Bug Fixes
  - File access to cloud drives has been improved for Macs .
  - Unchecking ‘Show Summary Stats’ in the table editor preferences now does indeed turn off the summary stats in exports to .csv.
  - ACS files can now be saved with a # character in the name.
  - Cluster explorer populations with less than 1% of the events are now plotted visibly in the bar chart window.
  - Cluster explorer statistics precision now responds to significant figure preference changes.
  - ‘Optimize weights’ used in combination with AutoSpill during compensation no longer causes a crash.
  - The proxy settings window OK and Cancel buttons are more accessible on Windows.
  - Statistics now displayed properly while using India as the location.
  - During installation, all FlowJo components will be packaged into a folder even when the default installation location is changed.
  - X-axis label will be displayed even if not all concatenated files have a value for a keyword defined parameter.
  - Hot keys for progressing through samples on a Mac have been re-enabled.
  - Creating a group from the Table Editor has been re-enabled.
  Known Issues
  - Gallios LMD files do not reflect LMD defaults.
  - The Moom and Cylance applications interfere with FlowJo performance.
