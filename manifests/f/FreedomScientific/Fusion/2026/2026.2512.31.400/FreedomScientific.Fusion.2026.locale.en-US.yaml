  Screen Sharing
  When you share your screen while ZoomText is running, other participants will by default see your screen at the regular size without any magnification or screen enhancements.
  Laptop Layout Hotkey Improvements
  - In Fusion, if you create a new hotkey while in Laptop Layout mode, the hotkey is retained when you install a newer version of Fusion over the currently installed version.
  - Fusion automatically restarts when you change it to use a different hotkey layout. Now when you switch from Desktop Layout to Laptop Layout mode, the correct mode is indicated with a checkmark in the Fusion menu under Preferences > Hotkey Layout.
  - The hotkey to start OCR is now CAPS LOCK+CTRL+ALT+O when Fusion is configured for Laptop Layout mode.
  - The hotkey to start Picture Smart AI is now CAPS LOCK+CTRL+ALT+P when configured for Laptop Layout mode.
  - Laptop Layouts are now correctly created for all languages based on the Desktop Layout for that locale.
  Signal Messaging App
  - Mouse echo now announces controls and other interface items when running ZoomText with the Signal messaging app.
  - ZoomText now correctly tracks the cursor position when using the Signal messaging app.
  Other Enhancements
  - When Windows is in high contrast mode, the Fusion menu bar now matches the colors of your high contrast theme.
  - You can now quickly access the Fusion menu bar from any Tab toolbar by pressing ALT followed by UP arrow.
  - The Key Tip letters that appear when you press ALT in the Fusion toolbar no longer overlap for the FSCompanion, Quick Access Bar, and Voice Assistant icons located in the upper corner of the toolbar.
  - All highlighted tab and menu items in the Fusion toolbar now appear with the same highlight color.
  - Tooltips in the ZoomText toolbar now display correctly when a button has focus while using the keyboard to navigate the toolbar.
  - The Magnifier/Reader version of ZoomText can be configured to run as ZoomText Magnifier without any Reader features. If ZoomText is configured to run as Magnifier only, it now retains this configuration when a newer version of software is installed.
  - Screenshots taken with apps such as Microsoft Snipping Tool are now captured without magnification or screen enhancements.
  - The following commands are now listed in the Command Keys dialog box when running the Magnifier only version of ZoomText:
    - Move to Tethered Source
    - Open Message Center
    - xFont Bold On/Off
  - The Tab pages in the ZoomText and Fusion About dialog boxes now respond and open faster when selected.
  - The Welcome dialog box in both ZoomText and Fusion has been resized to reduce the amount of scrolling needed to read the text.
  - The Welcome dialog box now clearly displays without any screen artifacts blocking the dialog box.
  - Your web browser password manager can now auto-fill your username and password for your Vispero Account.
  - Improved reliability of the Fusion Repair process.
  - User Account Control (UAC) is a Windows security feature that alerts you when a change requires administrator permission. When you modify a ZoomText or Fusion setting that requires administrator privileges, a UAC shield icon now appears on the OK button in the dialog box to indicate that administrator approval is required.
  - In Fusion, the Alva BC 6 braille display driver now appears in the list of braille displays in the Synthesizer and Braille Manager dialog box.
