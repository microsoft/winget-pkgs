ReleaseNotes: |-
  The following describes improvements made in the February 2026 update.
  Restart Button
  In previous releases, restarting ZoomText required fully closing the software and manually restarting it. While closed, you had to navigate the screen without magnification to locate the ZoomText desktop icon or the Windows Start menu, which can be inconvenient.
  This release now introduces a new Restart button in the Exit dialog box. When selected, it automatically closes and restarts ZoomText for you with no additional steps.
  To restart ZoomText:
  1. In the ZoomText menu, choose Exit. (You can also press CAPS LOCK+F4.)
     The Exit dialog opens.
  2. Select Restart.

  Note: You can automatically restart ZoomText by pressing CAPS LOCK+SPACEBAR, followed by F4 and bypassing the Exit dialog.
  Note: If the "Prompt to confirm intent to exit ZoomText" setting is disabled, ZoomText closes without displaying the Exit dialog.
  JAWS Settings Menu Shortcut in Fusion
  You can now quickly select the JAWS Settings menu in the Fusion Toolbar from anywhere on your screen by pressing INSERT+J followed by J. This works when Fusion is configured for Tab layout or Menu layout.
  New Display Adapter Option for Screen Sharing
  If you experience technical issues such as a black screen during screen sharing, you can now enable the Magnification API (non-magnified screen capture) option in the Display Adapter setting. When enabled, if you are sharing your screen, it is shared without magnification or screen enhancements.
  Other Enhancements
  - When running JAWS and ZoomText together, and JAWS starts first, xFont in ZoomText is now enabled correctly.
  - Performance has improved when typing in the Command Keys Search field.
  - Tethered View now works correctly in the Start menu when running Windows 11 25H2 (Build 26220.6690 Insider Dev Channel).
  - When running JAWS and ZoomText together, values in the Zoom Level spin box are now spoken correctly when navigating this control in the Magnifier tab.
