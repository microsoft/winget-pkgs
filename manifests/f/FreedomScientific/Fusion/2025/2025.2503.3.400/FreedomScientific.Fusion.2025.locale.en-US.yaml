ReleaseNotes: |-
  The following describes new features and improvements made in the March 2025 update.
  ARM64 Support in ZoomText and Fusion
  We are excited to announce that ZoomText and Fusion 2025 now fully support ARM64 devices running Windows 11. This means a faster and smoother experience on the latest Copilot+ PCs, like the Surface Pro (11th edition) and Surface Laptop (7th edition). The ZoomText and Fusion 2025 installers automatically detect ARM64 processors and will install the right version on your device. To verify, open the About dialog (ZoomText or Fusion menu > Help > About) and you will see either ZoomText® 2025 (ARM64) or Fusion® 2025 (ARM64) as your software version.
  Live Text View
  Live Text View is a ZoomText screen magnifier feature that improves the readability of on-screen text in web browsers and other applications. It displays a continuous line of clear, easy-to-read text across the top or bottom of the screen, showing content from the cursor, mouse pointer, or focus location as you navigate documents, emails, and web pages. This content displays in a window known as the Live Text View, where you can customize the font, size, and color contrast to match your reading preferences.

  Here are a few examples of how Live Text View can make it easier to read text on a magnified screen.
  - Some text is hard to read, like yellow on a white background or dark gray on black. Live Text View helps by showing the text in a clear, easy-to-read font with high contrast colors that you choose. Just move your mouse over the text, and it will appear in the view window.
  - Decorative fonts and italic styles are good for attracting attention but can be difficult to read on a magnified screen. Live Text View makes this text readable in the view window.
  - Busy backgrounds can be distracting and cause text and images to blend into the background. Hovering the mouse pointer over this area of the screen can pick up lines of text and display them in the view window.
  - Page layouts with multiple columns and images, like those on a news website, can be a challenge to read with a screen magnifier since only a small portion of the screen is visible at a time. Constantly scrolling in different directions to follow the text can be frustrating and interrupt reading. Live Text View helps by allowing you to (1) lower magnification to see more of the screen and overall layout, (2) move the mouse pointer or focus to the area of interest and the text you want to read, and (3) view the text clearly in the Live Text View window.
  - A settings dialog in an application often includes elements like check boxes, radio buttons, dropdown lists, and spin boxes. By positioning the mouse pointer over any of these items, Live Text View can recognize them and show both the element and its current state clearly in the view window.
  - Pairing Live Text View with AppReader App View combines the best of both. Live Text View provides clear visual text, while AppReader adds speech output and highlights the exact text position. This ensures strong reading support while allowing you to stay active in the document and make text edits as needed.
  Live Text View is an Early Adopter Program Feature
  Live Text View is available for preview as an Early Adopter Program feature. It currently supports single monitor configurations. It is not available in remote desktop configurations or on touch screen devices.

  4. After restarting, Live Text View appears on the Magnifier toolbar tab. It replaces the Navigation button, which is now a submenu in the ZoomText or Fusion menu.

  Using Live Text View and Scrolling Text
  When Live Text View is enabled, any line of text located beneath the mouse pointer, at the cursor position, or the focus location displays in the view window. If the line of text exceeds the width of the view window, a left or right scroll arrow displays at the beginning or end of the displayed text.
  To scroll and display more text in the Live Text View window, do the following:
  - Press CAPS LOCK+RIGHT ARROW to scroll to the right
  - Press CAPS LOCK+LEFT ARROW to scroll to the left
  - With your mouse pointer focused on a line of text, move your mouse to the right or left to continue reading text in the Live Text View window.
