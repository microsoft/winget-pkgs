ReleaseNotes: |-
  The following describes improvements made in the September 2025 update.
  - Unicode characters in ZoomText Message Center now display as normal text instead of showing their code values.
  - Cursor enhancements and focus tracking now work reliably when typing in a Command Prompt window.
  - VMWare is now known as Omnissa. As a result, several VMWare scripts stopped working. This has been resolved and both old VMWare scripts and new Omnissa scripts are now supported.
  - True Center Tracking always keeps tracked objects in the center of the screen. It is now automatically disabled when you enable Live Text View.
  - ZoomText now correctly reads the "Auto renews on" field in the ZoomText About dialog box.
  - ZoomText now announces only the current selection in the Chrome search box instead of both the current and previous selections.
  - The Recorder feature now works correctly after switching between different Vocalizer Expressive 2 voices and languages in ZoomText.
  - Convenient OCR is a feature that lets you recognize text in inaccessible documents and images. In Fusion, Convenient OCR's Mouse Mode is now working again when using it with Outlook messages.
  - The "Run ZoomText As" command is no longer visible in the Fusion Preferences menu.
