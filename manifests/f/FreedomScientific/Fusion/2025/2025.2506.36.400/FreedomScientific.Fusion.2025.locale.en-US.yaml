ReleaseNotes: |-
  The following describes improvements made in the July 2025 update.
  Starting with the July 2025 release, JAWS, ZoomText, and Fusion now support time-based Software Maintenance Agreements (SMAs) for perpetual licenses. This allows users to run any version of the software within a specified time frame. For example, a Fusion two-year timed SMA purchased on July 2, 2025, permits running any release prior to July 2, 2027. Contact Freedom Scientific sales or your local distributor for more information.
  Improved Google Doc Support
  ZoomText now offers noticeably improved support in Google Docs. Features like AppReader, Live Text View, mouse echo, and typing echo now work when reading or navigating documents. You may experience inconsistent results when using the App View tool while scrolling through a Google Doc.
  ZoomText and Fusion 2025: Now with DirectX 11 Support for Better Performance
  ZoomText and Fusion 2025 now support DirectX 11 as an Early Adopter Program feature. This new support:
  - Reduces memory and resource usage
  - Improves compatibility with multiple 4K monitors and modern graphics cards
  - Enhances support for current and future development, which ensures a more responsive and reliable user experience.
  Enable DirectX 11 in Early Adopter Program
  DirectX 11 is part of the new Magnification Engine 2026 update and is available as an Early Adopter Program feature. To use DirectX 11, you must first enable the new Magnification Engine 2026 in the Early Adopter Program dialog.
  - From the ZoomText or Fusion menu, choose Help > Early Adopter Program.
  - In the Early Adopter Program dialog, select Magnification Engine 2026.
  - Click OK and restart the software. The magnification engine and DirectX 11 are now available for use.
  Navigation Quick Keys in Live Text View (Fusion only)
  Live Text View in Fusion now supports Navigation Quick Keys, giving you a faster way to move through content in web pages, documents, and emails.
  What are Navigation Quick Keys?
  Navigation Quick Keys are single letters or keystroke combinations that let you jump to specific types of elements. For example, in a web page:
  - Press H to move to the next heading.
  - Press P to move to the next paragraph.
  - Press B to move to the next button.
  For more, see Navigation Quick Keys for a list of commonly used keystrokes.
  Where can I use them?
  Navigation Quick Keys are supported in:
  - Web pages
  - PDF files
  - Microsoft Word documents
    (Note, you must first enable Navigation Quick Keys by pressing INSERT+Z. You can then type the keystrokes.)
  - Outlook messages
  How does it work in Live Text View?
  When you press a Navigation Quick Key:
  - Live Text View displays the corresponding text.
  - The Position Indicator symbol () appears, indicating you are using Navigation Quick Keys.
  - The text is read aloud using Fusion speech.
  This makes it easier to follow along visually and stay focused as you navigate.
  Picture Smart AI
  Fusion's Picture Smart AI Mouse Mode now analyzes the correct screen area even if the Display Adapter is set to Magnification API.
  Microsoft Outlook
  - The accuracy of the focus enhancement locator has been improved when reading and composing emails in Outlook. You will now see more precise tracking as you move through your messages.
  - The cursor enhancement now appears in the correct position within a line of text and no longer jumps to the beginning of the line when reading a message.
  - While creating a new meeting in Outlook Calendar, program echo now reliably announces each attendee as you add them from the Invite list.
  - Program echo now speaks when composing an email and adding suggested recipients displayed in the To: field.
  Activation
  After completing product activation for a JAWS, ZoomText, or Fusion license, users are now prompted to register their software. This option is currently available for English installations.
  Other Enhancements
  - The Startup Wizard now works as expected in ZoomText. When you click Cancel, your changes will not be applied.
  - ZoomText magnification no longer freezes when editing or entering Reading Zones.
  - When using AppReader in a web browser, it now begins reading from the same location as the text cursor.
  - When navigating the text cursor at the end of a line of text in a web page, ZoomText now correctly reads the text instead of saying blank.
  - Vocalizer Expressive voices (version 2) are now available with ZoomText on ARM64 devices.
  - Improvements have been made to the way ZoomText reads items in Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer tool.
