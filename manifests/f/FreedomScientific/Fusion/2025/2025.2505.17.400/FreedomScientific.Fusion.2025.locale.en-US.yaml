ReleaseNotes: |-
  The following describes improvements made in the May 2025 update.
  Starting with the May 2025 release, JAWS, ZoomText, and Fusion now supports Home and Professional subscription licenses. Please contact Freedom Scientific sales or your local distributor for more information.

  New Live Text View Released
  Live Text View enhances readability on magnified screens by displaying clear, high-contrast text in a separate view window as you hover over hard-to-read content—making it easier to read decorative fonts, low-contrast colors, or text on busy backgrounds. It can also be paired with AppReader for added speech and visual tracking support.
  Live Text View is now part of the Magnifier toolbar tab in ZoomText and Fusion, replacing the Navigation button.

  Below is a list of improvements made between the March 2025 Early Adopter release and the May 2025 update. For more details on how Live Text View works, refer to the Live Text View section (March 2025) later on this page.
  Live Text View Improvements in the May 2025 Update
  - Live Text View now supports multiple monitors. This works with all multiple monitor modes.
  - If you switch from one display to another display, the Live Text View also switches to the currently active display. This works when ZoomText is running multiple monitors and is configured for MultiView Local or MultiView Global zoom windows.
  - Live Text View now works with all single-monitor zoom windows: Full, Overlay, Lens, Line, and Docked.
  - Live Text View is now available in remote desktop environments and can display on both the client and server. This requires ZoomText 2025 (May 2025 update or later) to be installed on the client and server computers.
  - Live Text View operates on touch screen devices. You can now tap the icons in the Live Text View to scroll left or right and select check boxes, radio buttons, and other user interface elements.
  - When an image includes alternative text in a document or web page, the alt text now appears in the Live Text View, highlighted in an accent color.
  - When text is a link in a document or web page, the link text is now underlined in the Live Text View.
  - When using Excel with Live Text View, the contents of a selected cell now appear in the Live Text View in an accent color. This is in addition to the previously mentioned alt text and link text support.
  - Live Text View supports text cursor and mouse hover when reading and navigating in Adobe Acrobat Reader.
  - You can now use Freeze View while Live Text View is enabled.
  - You can now use the Adjust tool while Live Text View is enabled.
  - Live Text View can now be added to and opened from the Quick Access Bar.

  Updated Startup Wizard
  When you install a new version of ZoomText, the Startup Wizard opens automatically to help you get set up. It now includes easy-to-use pages where you can choose your magnification, visual enhancements, and speech settings. If you are using Fusion, you will only see the magnification and visual enhancements page. Speech settings are set up separately in the JAWS Startup Wizard.
  To save your changes after closing the Startup Wizard, in the ZoomText or Fusion menu, choose Configurations > Save As Default.
  The image below shows the new Magnification and Visual Enhancements page.

  Magnification API
  The Display Adapter’s Compatibility Mode setting has been renamed to Magnification API to better reflect its functionality. This functionality is built on a Microsoft-provided technology for screen magnification.
  When enabled, the Magnification API provides two primary benefits:
  1. Magnified Content during Screen Sharing in Video Conferencing
     During screen sharing sessions via applications such as Zoom and Microsoft Teams, viewers will see the same ZoomText enhancements as the presenter, including magnification levels, color filters, and cursor enhancements.
  2. Support for HDR Monitors
     This setting allows ZoomText to function with High Dynamic Range (HDR) monitors, which may otherwise present compatibility challenges.
  All features—such as xFont, AppReader, and visual enhancements—remain fully supported, whether using the Magnification API or the default display mode, which utilizes the system’s graphics card directly.
  To change the Display Adapter setting, in the ZoomText menu, choose Help > Advanced > Display Adapter.
  Other Enhancements
  - ZoomText and Fusion 2025 support Windows Server 2025.
  - Tethered View has been restored when using it with the Windows Start menu in the latest version of Windows 11.
  - The Welcome to ZoomText page has been streamlined and now includes updated, more relevant hotkeys.
  - Three additional delay times have been added to the “Keep the pointer from crossing the border for” setting. The times are 2.5, 5, and 10 seconds. This causes a delay for the selected duration when moving the mouse pointer between multiple displays.
  - When the last character or word in the Live Text View window is selected, the current line continues to display in the Live Text View and does not advance to the next line in the document.
  - After toggling Live Text View off and on, text now appears again in the Live Text View.
  - When you are running Live Text View and you turn on a webcam that is configured for Docked View, Live Text View will now turn off.
  - Performance has been improved when using Teams, New Outlook, or Edge while simultaneously running Live Text View.
  - The FSCompanion, Quick Access Bar, and Voice Assistant buttons, located in the upper right corner of the ZoomText toolbar, now display in the Live Text View when you hover over them using the mouse pointer.
  - In Silent mode, AppReader now correctly displays and responds to the selected Highlight Speed reading rate when Live Text View is on.
  - Performance has been improved when using AppReader to read by word, sentence, line, and paragraph while simultaneously running Live Text View.
  - AppReader performance has improved when running ZoomText on Windows 11 release 24H2.
  - When using ZoomText in a remote Citrix environment, you can now navigate and track the entire magnified screen directly on your local client system.
  - The Voice button on the Reader toolbar tab now updates correctly and shows the Off state when speech is disabled through the Voice Settings dialog.
  - Focus enhancements in ZoomText and Fusion now work correctly when navigating to the Ask Copilot button in the Windows Start menu.
  - Focus enhancement performance has improved when navigating the search box in the Windows Start menu.
  - An issue that affected the Braille and Text Viewer when using Fusion with multiple monitors has been resolved. Previously, if the primary display was positioned on the right and the secondary on the left, the Viewer would appear compressed on the secondary screen. The Viewer now displays properly with this display configuration.
