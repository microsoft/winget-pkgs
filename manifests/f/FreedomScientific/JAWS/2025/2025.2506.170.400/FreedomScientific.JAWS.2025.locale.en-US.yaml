ReleaseNotes: |-
  The following is a list of improvements made between the May 2025 release and the July 2025 update.
  Starting with the July 2025 release, JAWS, ZoomText, and Fusion now supports time-based Software Maintenance Agreements (SMAs) for perpetual licenses. This allows users to run any version of the software within a specified time frame. For example, a JAWS two-year timed SMA purchased on July 2, 2025, permits running any release prior to July 2, 2027. Contact Freedom Scientific sales or your local distributor for more information.
  Label Manager
  The new Label Manager offers a quick and convenient way to manage custom labels you have created for poorly labeled elements on web pages using the CTRL+INSERT+TAB keystroke. Replacing the separate Custom Label, Custom Label Delete, and Custom Label Delete All options, there is now a single dialog for modifying or deleting custom labels. The Label Manager is available in web browsers or anywhere the Virtual Cursor is active, and can be accessed through the Run JAWS Manager dialog (INSERT+F2) or by using the new layered command INSERT+SPACEBAR, ALT+L.
  When the Label Manager opens, you are placed in a list containing any custom labels you have created for the current website or domain. You can then navigate to a specific label and then choose Edit Label or Delete Label depending on the action you want to perform.
  Note: If the AI Labeler feature is enabled through the Early Adopter Program, the Label Manager also includes any labels generated using the INSERT+G command.
  MathCAT Now the Default for Reading Math in Spanish
  MathCAT is now the default for interacting with math content in the Spanish version of JAWS. This offers Spanish users improved access to math content in speech and Braille. The Código Matemático Unificado (CMU) Braille math code is in effect when your translation mode is set to Spanish Grade 1 or Grade 2. MathCAT access includes:
  - When encountering math expressions on web pages or in Word documents, the expression and associated announcements are presented entirely in Spanish using both speech and Braille.
  - When exploring expressions in the Math Viewer, all math content, table coordinates, and other messages are presented in Spanish using both speech and Braille.
  - In the Math Viewer, users have access to all supported MathCAT commands such as setting and reading place markers.
  - The ability for Spanish users to customize various Math options through the Math group in Settings Center.
  Note: Support for the CMU math code in the Braille Math Editor is still a work in progress and will continue to be improved in future updates.
  AI Labeler (Early Adopter Program)
  - AI generated labels using INSERT+G are now saved automatically so the new label is announced each time the specific element is encountered.
  - If you press INSERT+G on a web page element that already contains a custom label, JAWS displays a dialog containing both the current label and a suggested replacement. You can then choose whether or not to replace the current label with the new one.
  - If the AI Labeler feature is enabled, you can now use ALT+INSERT+G to access the legacy Graphics Labeler.
  ARIA and Web
  - JAWS no longer announces the minimum and maximum values for sliders that contain defined text values such as elapsed time. Additionally, improved the consistency of announcing minimum and maximum values for sliders containing no specific text values.
  - When reading with Say All on web pages, JAWS no longer includes tooltip/title information from elements like links as this interrupted the reading flow.
  - Addressed an issue where continuously using the Headings list (INSERT+F6) to move to a heading on a page would unexpectedly stop working after a period of time.
  - The Virtual Cursor now remains in sync with Forms Mode when filling out fields contained in tables.
  Google Suite
  - JAWS now reads the contents of tables in Google Docs as expected when navigating using Table layer commands (INSERT+SPACEBAR, T).
  - Table cells are no longer announced twice while navigating by paragraph in Google Docs.
  - Bullets for list items are no longer spoken twice in some instances in Google Docs.
  - When pressing UP ARROW from a blank line in Google Docs, Addressed an issue where JAWS sometimes read the entire paragraph instead of the last line.
  - Addressed an issue where JAWS was not reading the contents of the Find dialog after pressing CTRL+F in a Google Docs or Google Sheets document.
  - When creating a new message in Gmail that contains a bulleted list, JAWS no longer says “bullet” twice if a line begins with a misspelled word.
  Office Apps
  - JAWS now announces group information as you navigate the View Settings in Outlook (new).
  - Using table navigation commands (ALT+CTRL+ARROWS) in an Outlook (new) message no longer moves focus to the Home tab.
  - After pressing ALT+I in Word to open Copilot, JAWS now speaks the current item as you navigate the available options.
  - Improved JAWS indication of cross references in Word documents. This includes alerting you when text contains a link for moving to the cross referenced section, and announcing when the start of a cross referenced section includes a bookmark.
  - JAWS now says “star” as expected when typing characters into the Password field in the Office 365 Encrypt Document dialog.
  - You can now consistently use TAB to move through links in a PowerPoint slideshow.
  - JAWS now indicates if an image or shape on a PowerPoint slide is decorative.
  - JAWS no longer cuts off when reading long chat messages in Teams.
  - When typing a new chat message in Teams, Addressed an issue where the Braille cursor would no longer be at the correct location if the beginning of the message included a spelling error.
  - Improved navigating through Outlook messages by subject with Unified Keyboard Processing enabled.
  - When navigating to a line in a loop component containing a link, JAWS now reads the entire line as expected.
  Visual Studio Code
  - Added a new Quick Settings option, Show Line Number in Status Cells, which allows you to configure whether or not JAWS includes the current line number in the status cells of your Braille display as you navigate a document.
  Braille
  - Fixed Braille commands for the BrailleSense 6 from Selvas BLV so they work as described in the product documentation.
  - Added a combo box for toggling between Nemeth and UEB Math to the Math > Braille group in Settings Center.
