ReleaseNotes: |-
  The following is a list of improvements made between the initial 2026 release and the December 2025 update.
  AI Labeler
  - On web pages, pressing INSERT+G on an image now creates a concise, natural alt text description that JAWS automatically saves for future visits. This is especially helpful for tasks like online shopping, where you can quickly review multiple product images. When you find something that interests you, you can use Picture Smart AI to get more details and ask follow-up questions.
  - After labeling an element with the AI Labeler, the Virtual Cursor now remains on that element, so you can continue working without losing your place.
  Page Explorer
  Links selected from the Important Links section of Page Explorer now open in the same browser that was active when Page Explorer was launched. Additionally, pressing CTRL+ENTER on a link opens the page in the current tab if you are using a Chromium based browser like Edge or Chrome.
  Picture Smart AI
  When you use Picture Smart AI commands (such as INSERT+SPACEBAR, P, ENTER) to ask a preliminary question to multiple AI services about an image, Picture Smart now immediately displays a response. You no longer have to read a full image description prior to the answer, making it faster and easier to get the information you need.
  Web Pages No Longer Read Automatically When Loaded
  In response to user feedback, JAWS no longer automatically begins reading web pages after they load by default as this has become less helpful with modern websites. While JAWS still announces core page information on load like the title along with the number of regions, headings, and links, focus now remains at the top for immediate use of Navigation Quick Keys and other web navigation features. You can re-enable automatic reading in Settings Center under Web/HTML/PDFs > Reading > Document and web pages automatically read when loaded.
  Aria and Web
  - JAWS now correctly reports the number of edit fields on the Google Gemini website.
  - Extra spaces are no longer inserted before buttons that use the aria-pressed attribute, improving first-letter navigation in the Select a Button dialog (CTRL+INSERT+B).
  - The aria-orientation attribute is now properly recognized by JAWS.
  - JAWS more reliably announces when strikethrough formatting ends when navigating tables with table reading commands.
  - If a web page is inserted using an iframe, JAWS no longer speaks the path and file name of the page.
  - To improve navigation, JAWS is more consistent with ensuring radio buttons along with their associated labels are read on the same line.
  - The currently selected tab in the Microsoft Store is now announced correctly.
  Microsoft Office
  - INSERT+B now reads the contents of most Word dialog boxes more consistently.
  - When typing a new message in Teams with JAWS tutor messages enabled, JAWS now speaks the appropriate tutor help as you move through the toolbar.
  - JAWS no longer says “edit” before certain buttons and links when navigating the Teams help page.
  - In Outlook’s View settings, items in the Select available columns from combo box are no longer spoken multiple times.
  - When opening the sheet tab context menu in Excel, JAWS now announces the menu as it appears.
  - Unnecessary speech and Braille output have been removed for validation dropdown cells in Excel.
  Braille
  - Using the Monarch multiline Braille display in Google Docs, you can now enter Contracted Braille from the display’s Perkins-style keyboard as well as pan through text.
  - JAWS now supports the Dot Pad multiline Braille display on ARM devices.
  - When using Contracted Braille output, file names entered in Save As dialogs are no longer shown in Computer Braille.
  - The Optelec ALVA BC6 Braille display can now be set up and used with JAWS 2026.
  - When navigating a Virtual Viewer window using the JAWS cursor, dots 7 and 8 are now shown on the Braille display as expected to indicate the cursor location.
  - Improved Braille support for various Vispero user account dialogs.
  Other
  - You can now open and read books in the latest updates to the Amazon Kindle for PC app.
  - When running Fusion 2026, the JAWS serial number is now returned correctly for third-party scripts that depend on it for authorization.
  - JAWS now includes the latest MathCAT libraries, offering improved speech and Braille output for math content.
  - Mouse echo now works correctly in the Signal desktop application.
  - Editing text in the JetBrains IntelliJ editor window is now more reliable.
  - After choosing New > Folder in File Explorer, focus now correctly moves to the edit field.
  - Progress bar updates in File Explorer are now consistently announced while copying files.
  - Signing in to your Vispero account now supports saving your username and password in your browser’s password manager.
  - For international releases of JAWS that do not yet support Vispero accounts, you can no longer inadvertently access the Account tab of the About dialog using the Touch cursor.
  - The JAWS Script Manager no longer closes unexpectedly when encountering an assigned text string missing an initial quote.
