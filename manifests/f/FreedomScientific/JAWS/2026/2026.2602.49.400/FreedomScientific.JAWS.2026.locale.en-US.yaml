ReleaseNotes: |-
  The following is a list of improvements made between the December 2025 release and the February 2026 update.
  Updated WhatsApp Support
  The Windows version of the popular WhatsApp messaging application has received a major update, bringing big changes to how the app looks and works. JAWS has been updated to keep pace, restoring reliable access to chat features and making it easier to stay connected.
  With this update, many familiar JAWS keystrokes and features from earlier WhatsApp versions are once again available in the latest release, including:
  - Automatically announce incoming chat messages and indicate when a contact is typing. Announcements can be turned off through JAWS Quick Settings (INSERT+V) if desired.
  - Review the most recent nine messages using ALT+1 through ALT+9 on the number row.
  - Quickly move between key areas of the app, such as the chat edit field (ALT+E), the history for the current chat (ALT+H), or the list of available chats (ALT+C).
  - Announce the name and status of the currently selected contact using ALT+SHIFT+S.
  - Describe selected images with Picture Smart using INSERT+SPACEBAR, P, ENTER.
  For a complete list of available JAWS keystrokes for WhatsApp, press INSERT+H.
  For a complete list of WhatsApp keystrokes, press INSERT+W.

  Aria and Web
  - Improved JAWS reading descriptive information for tab controls on web pages.
  - JAWS now reads descriptive information for grids that use the aria-describedby attribute.
  Microsoft Office
  - JAWS now more reliably reads the options in the Click to Snooze to be reminded in combo box for a Calendar reminder in Outlook (Classic).
  - In recent Office 365 updates, JAWS now lets you navigate and manage comments in the Microsoft Word Comments pane.
  - JAWS no longer speaks multiple messages when using various shortcut keys in Word.
  - Multiple messages are no longer spoken when selecting all content in a Word document using CTRL+A.
  Braille
  - The Message List + Preview Pane Split Braille view is now available in Outlook (New). From Outlook (New), press ALT+INSERT+V (ALT+CAPS LOCK+V in Laptop layout) to switch to this view which displays the message list in region one and the contents of the current message in region two. To use this view, the Reading pane must be set to the bottom or right.
  - JAWS now supports the Zoomax Braille display on ARM devices.
  - The Liblouis Braille translator used by JAWS and Fusion has been updated to version 3.36.0.
  Other
  - If JAWS, ZoomText, or Fusion starts without an internet connection, the account experience now immediately restarts as soon as you’re back online without having to restart the software. You’ll be prompted to sign in if you haven’t already, and if you are signed in, all account-related features will become available right away.
  - A Sign out and Exit option has been added to the account sign-out process. This resets the software sign-in experience, making it easier for distributors to prepare devices while ensuring customers have full time to complete their own account setup.
  - If you have used the JAWS Dictionary Manager to create rules for multiple languages, you can now select a specific language and choose Delete to quickly remove all rules for that language.
