  Release Notes
  Highlights
  - Flow has reach 10K stars!
  - Showcase your plugin on flowlauncher.com! Visit here to find out how. Help users learn more about your plugin, see images and videos of it in action, and read blog posts about it.
  - Use the Windows key to trigger flow.
  - It is now possible to assign multiple action keywords to a plugin, e.g. set * to trigger on global search and b for plugin only results.
  - New 'home page' feature allows plugins to add their results to the search window for quick access.
  - Overall UI look and feel have been further refined
  Previous Windows versions
  On next feature release v2.0.0, Flow will only be compatible with Windows 10 & 11 onwards. This is because the newer libraries and framework we would like to move towards, are no longer compatible with older versions of Windows. This means v1.20.x will still be Windows 7+ compatible, but when v2.0.0 is released, flow may no longer be compatible with versions prior to Windows 10.
