  Highlights
  Dialog Jump
  - Use Alt+G to quickly jump the Open/Save As dialog window path to the path of the active file manager.
  - Search for a file/folder and quickly jump to its path in the Open/Save As dialog window. This is enabled via settings 'General' section.
  Automatic Plugin Update Check
  - A new option to enable automatic checking for plugin updates.
  - A new update dialog will allow for selective plugin updating.
  Release Notes Window
  - A release notes window will be available when a new update arrives, allowing you to check the release notes directly from the app. You can also access this window from the "About" section in settings.

  - When the "Search with Pinyin" option is enabled via settings, a new option for Double Pinyin search will also be available.
  Previous Windows Versions
  From this release onward, Flow will only be compatible with Windows 10, 11, and future versions. This is because the newer libraries and frameworks we plan to adopt are no longer compatible with older versions of Windows. Only v1.20.x will remain compatible with Windows 7 and above.
  New & Updated Plugins
  New and updated plugins will no longer be available for versions of flow prior to v2.0.0. This is because the default plugins have been upgraded to .NET 9, making them incompatible with older versions.
