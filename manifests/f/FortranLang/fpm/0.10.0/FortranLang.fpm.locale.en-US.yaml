ShortDescription: A Fortran package manager and build system
Description: |-
  fpm is a package manager that helps you create Fortran projects from source -- it automatically determines dependencies!
  Most significantly fpm lets you draw upon other fpm packages in distributed git repositories as if the packages were a basic part of your default programming environment, as well as letting you share your projects with others in a similar manner.
  All output goes into the directory "build/" which can generally be removed and rebuilt if required. Note that if external packages are being used you need network connectivity to rebuild from scratch.
