ShortDescription: A Fortran package manager and build system
Description: |-
  Fortran Package Manager (fpm) is a package manager and build system for Fortran.
  Its key goal is to improve the user experience of Fortran programmers.
  It does so by making it easier to build your Fortran program or library, run the executables, tests, and examples, and distribute it as a dependency to other Fortran projects.
