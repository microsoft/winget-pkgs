  Kubernetes compatibility
  This release is compatible with the following Kubernetes versions:
  ──────────────────┬────────────────
  Kubernetes version│Minimum required
  ──────────────────┼────────────────
  v1.33             │>= 1.32.0
  ──────────────────┼────────────────
  v1.34             │>= 1.34.1
  ──────────────────┼────────────────
  v1.35             │>= 1.35.0
  ──────────────────┴────────────────
  Note
  Note that the Flux project offers support only for the latest three minor versions of Kubernetes.
  Backwards compatibility with older versions of Kubernetes and OpenShift is offered by vendors such as
  ControlPlane that provide enterprise support for Flux.
  OpenShift compatibility
  Flux can be installed on Red Hat OpenShift cluster directly from OperatorHub using Flux Operator. The operator allows the configuration of Flux multi-tenancy lockdown, network policies, persistent storage, sharding, vertical scaling and the synchronization of the cluster state from Git repositories, OCI artifacts, and S3-compatible storage.
  Upgrade procedure
  ⚠️ The Flux APIs v1beta2 and v2beta2 (deprecated in 2024) have reached end-of-life and have been removed from the CRDs.
  Please follow the Upgrade Procedure for Flux v2.7+ for a smooth upgrade from older versions of Flux to v2.8.
