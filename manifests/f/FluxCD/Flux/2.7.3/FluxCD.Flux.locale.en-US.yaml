  Highlights
  Flux v2.7.3 is a patch release that comes with various fixes. Users are encouraged to upgrade for the best experience.
  ℹ️ Please follow the Upgrade Procedure for Flux v2.7+ for a smooth upgrade from Flux v2.6 to the latest version.
  Fixes:
  - Restore SOCKS5 proxy support in all controllers
  - Fix status reporting of HelmReleases with RetryOnFailure strategy
  - Automated retries for ImagePolicies when no image tags are found in the database
  - Fix alerting for Telegram's message_thread_id
  - Allow running kustomize-controller and helm-controller on the same loopback interface as source-watcher
