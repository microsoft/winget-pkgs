  What's Changed

  - installation: windows users - the installer now uses 64-bit mode, and now (correctly) installs into "Program Files" by default.
  If you are upgrading from a previous version, you need to uninstall the old version in "Program Files (x86)" manually.
  - feature: remove page from fixed size document (thanks to @PhilDevProg)
  - feature: specify page order when exporting documents with layouts that expand in horizontal and vertical directions (thanks to @Kneemund)
  - feature: inertial touch scrolling (thanks to @Kneemund)
  - feature: ability to toggle drawing cursor visibility
  - feature: "focus mode" that hides the toolbars, improving the experience on low-resolution tablets
  - feature: dedicated zoom tool, making navigating while touch-drawing is enabled easier
  - improvement: selection highlights for brush-strokes
  - improvement: ctrl + scroll following the pointer
  - improvement: scale-ratio when resizing the selection with locked aspect-ratio
  - improvement: provide selection content as Svg and Png when copying/cutting to the clipboard
  - improvement: save file logic in close tab/window dialogs
  - improvement: memory consumption when loading rnote files
  - UI: page controls for the fixed-size layout were moved into the canvas menu dropdown
  - UI: undo/redo buttons were moved to the pen switcher toolbar
  - fix: apply pressure curves when exporting to xopp
  - fix: single element/position strokes were not rendered
  - fix: stop document autoexpanding when scrolling with scrollbars
