  WINDOWS USER ONLY
  I'm sorry, but due to unexpected changes and an internal error in the Windows QT Installer (issue description), I have to release an updated QLog version for this platform with instructions how to install it. Please follow these steps:- If you already have  older versions (< 0.35.2) installed, perform a manual uninstall of that version.
  - Install the new version of QLog from qlog-installer0.36.0_1.exe package
  Please follow the above instructions even if you already have QLog version 0.36 installed.There is no need to worry about your QSOs during the uninstall, as the uninstall procedure does not delete the internal data of QLog. Of course, a backup is always recommended.I hope that future versions will be installed correctly.Windows Libraries:
