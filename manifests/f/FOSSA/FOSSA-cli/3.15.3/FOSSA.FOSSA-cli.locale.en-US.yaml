ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Remove fossa snippets subcommand and documentation (#1623).
    The fossa snippets subcommand has been replaced by fossa analyze --snippet-scan (documentation). If you are still using fossa snippets, you can temporarily keep using it by using versions of the CLI previous to this release. We will eventually be sunsetting the services that back fossa snippets, but will keep them running to mid-February at the very earliest. Once those services stop running then fossa snippets will no longer work at all, even when using older versions of the CLI. Please reach out to support@fossa.com if you have any questions.
  - Allow snippet scanning of binary files. This allows us to find exact matches for binary files. (No PR. This was implemented in a separate binary that does snippet scanning for us.)
