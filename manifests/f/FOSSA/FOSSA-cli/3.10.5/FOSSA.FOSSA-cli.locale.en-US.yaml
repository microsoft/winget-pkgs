ReleaseNotes: |-
  Container scanning: Resolved a large number of issues with scanning containers (#1514, #1521)
  - Pulling containers from recent versions of Docker are properly supported.
  - OCI container hosts are better supported.
  - Scanning exported containers from recent versions of Docker are properly supported.
  - Authentication is better supported overall, it now integrates with native Docker authentication providers.
  - The old container scanning functionality still exists in FOSSA CLI as a fallback if the new functionality fails.
  Note
  FOSSA built a separate binary to handle pulling images; refer to its repository for details.
  This binary is bundled into FOSSA CLI, you don't need to do anything special to use it.
