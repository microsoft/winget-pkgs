  Febooti Command Line Email is a powerful but easy to use email-sending utility that supports all basic and advanced email client's sending capabilities

  The email client allows sending mail directly from Windows command line (DOS prompt). Attach an unlimited number of files to emails, use rich formatted HTML or simple text email, and use CC or BCC, all over a secure SSL connection. Use febootimail in Scheduled Tasks, CGI scripts, and VBA, from virtually any software.

  Corporate users can authenticate against the Microsoft Active Directory and send mail via Exchange Server, while others can use mail server authentication secured with industry-standard SSL data encryption, such as Gmail. Febootimail also supports STARTTLS secure communication and most of the other authentication methods, including LOGIN, PLAIN, NTLM, and CRAM-MD5.

  - SSL (Secure Socket Layer) and STARTTLS provide maximum security by encrypting communication sessions between the Command Line Email client and SMTP server, including Gmail, Exchange Server, and Lotus Notes.
  - Multiple AUTH methods—NTLM, and CRAM-MD5 authentication methods are added to basic PLAIN and LOGIN, as well as awesome automatic authentication method detection.
  - Intensive, extended debugging and testing have led to a significant number of improvements and bugfixes, making Command Line Email even more stable, fast, and efficient.
