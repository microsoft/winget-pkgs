Description: |-
  Automation Workshop is a software tool for Windows that allows automating time-consuming, complex, repetitive, and recurring processes

  Automation Workshop is a job scheduler tool that is orchestrated by an automation studio with an intelligent automation user interface. No programming is required to create event-driven and scheduled jobs with advanced automation technology—Triggers, Actions, Variable Wizard.

  By effectively uniting an intuitive visual interface with rich parameter specificity, Automation Workshop allows designing Tasks of script-like complexity. Thus, without requiring any coding experience, you are equipped with tools capable of automatically joining normally unconnected (i.e., manually connected) processes.

  Automate virtually any task using advanced Job Scheduler Trigger, intelligent file and remote Folder Watchers, or simply system startup triggers. These Triggers can be dynamically linked with 100+ workload automation Actions allowing users to create automated tasks for jobs like file and folder operations, compressing files with popular Windows or Linux archiver support, uploading or downloading files from secure FTP servers or even a cloud.

  Automation Workshop includes the necessary management, monitoring, reporting, and logging features that allow the user to uniquely identify processes and problems and to stay informed about relevant system operations.
