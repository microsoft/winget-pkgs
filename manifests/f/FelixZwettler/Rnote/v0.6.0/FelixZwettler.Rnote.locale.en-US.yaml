  What's Changed

  - orga: Rnote now follows a new versioning scheme - feature updates will increment x, while patches will increment y in versions 0.x.y . Breakages in the file format will be explicitely announced (but we'll work as hard as possible to avoid it!) and are not reflected in the version anymore.
  - orga: the app is now available for Windows and MacOS! Check the installation section on the website / README, you'll find links to the installer and app bundle there.
