  New Features and Improvements in Foxit PDF Reader 2025.2.0.33046
  - New features and enhancements for AI Assistant
    - Foxit PDF Reader is the first PDF solution to natively support Model Context Protocol (MCP), seamlessly connecting your documents to external tools. With MCP integration, the built-in AI Assistant lets you trigger actions like “Create a Jira issue” or “Send to Salesforce” directly from your PDF, no app-switching, fewer clicks, and more time saved.
    - Enhance the Intelligent Read feature by enabling the reading of document summaries aloud and turning document content into a two-person podcast-style conversation, offering a faster, more engaging way to consume documents.
    - Integrate live Web Search to bring up-to-date, relevant external context from the web into conversations, accessible directly within the AI Chat interface.
    - Agentic document chatting supports advanced reasoning and context-aware answers, minimizes hallucinations and guesswork, and improves accuracy when navigating complex content.
  - Provide a native 64-bit version of the application to enhance the performance on 64-bit systems.
  - Provide support for Microsoft’s Double Key Encryption (DKE), which protects highly sensitive data by using two encryption keys—one controlled by the user and another stored securely in Microsoft Azure (MSI package only).
  - Enable admins to use deployment tools to configure a shared location for stamp templates across the organization.
  - Compatible with USB writing pads for users to add handwritten signatures as stamps in PDFs conveniently.
