ShortDescription: The AI-powered customer service platform built for collaboration
Description: Front is a platform that brings all your work communication to one place. Instead of logging in to Gmail or Outlook to check your email, youâ€™ll log into Front. If you communicate for work over email groups, text, website chat, or social media, you can manage those messages in Front, too.
