ShortDescription: The AI-powered customer service platform built for collaboration
Description: Front is a platform that brings all your work communication to one place. Instead of logging in to Gmail or Outlook to check your email, you’ll log into Front. If you communicate for work over email groups, text, website chat, or social media, you can manage those messages in Front, too.
