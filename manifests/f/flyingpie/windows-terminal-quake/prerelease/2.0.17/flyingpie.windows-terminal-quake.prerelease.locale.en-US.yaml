ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Breaking change: On Windows, when using a hotkey with the "Shift" modifier and the "KeyChar" in the settings, you need to use the non-shifted character now:
    "Apps": [
      {
        // Before:
        "Hotkeys": [{ "Modifiers": "Control, Shift", "KeyChar": "!" }], // Shifted "1" => "!"
        // After:
        "Hotkeys": [{ "Modifiers": "Control, Shift", "KeyChar": "1" }]
      }
    ]
  }
  - Bugfix: Use "WindowHandle" as the unique window id for Win32, as that turns out to be deterministic. Also fixes the "Windows" page in the GUI.
  - Bugfix: (Windows) Some hotkey combos were broken when using the "Super" (Windows key) modifier.
  - Bugfix: (Windows) In some cases, toggling apps could lead to the selected keyboard layout disappearing (wild, I know).
  - Bugfix: GUI - Logs can be filtered on category and parameter values now.
  - Refactor: Startup/shutdown - More straigh-forward now, and fixed a bunch of cases where part of the process stayed alive when stopping.
  - Refactor: Windows - Make foreground window tracking a bunch more efficient.
  - Feature: AUR release; Flatpak release (custom remote); Scoop release has been moved to the official "extras" bucket".
  - Feature: Build script can directly install WTQ now, using "build.ps1|sh install".
  - Feature: Periodically update 'window props', e.g. opacity, always-on-top and taskbar icon visibility. Eases issues around these properties being reset on workspace switches.
  - Feature: Windows - "MainWindow": Match on whether a window is a process's "main" window.
  - Feature: GUI - Can show "DEBUG" and "VERBOSE" logs now, regardless of WTQ's global log level.
  - Feature: Nicer (I mean, that's what I think) out-of-the-box experience, with a (mostly empty) sample wtq.jsonc, and pops the GUI at first (with a quick "turn off" button nearby).
  - Feature: When saving settings from the GUI, special characters are no longer encoded, which makes the resulting settings file way more readable.
    "Apps": [
      {
        // Before:
        "FileName": "notepad\u002B\u002B",
        // After:
        "FileName": "notepad++"
      }
