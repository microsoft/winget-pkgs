ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Bugfix: Implemented missing parts for "ArgumentList" to work.
  - Bugfix: Properly close & dispose logger when the application fully exits.
  - Bugfix: Scoop - Removed "persist"-property from the Scoop manifest, since settings are loaded from the same location regardless of installation method (thanks to Chuckie Chen, #187).
  - Bugfix: Windows - In some cases a window couldn't be brought to the foreground, due to Windows preventing abuse of said function.
  - Feature: API & CLI to control WTQ programmatically (thanks to Tim Gilevich #194).
  - Feature: Added 'WindowClass' as a property to match windows on (Windows only).
  - Feature: Added 'WorkingDirectory' setting, for use when starting a new process.
  - Feature: Apps can now be matched on their window title (see "WindowTitle" property in app settings).
  - Feature: Feature flags, for scary features (such as the new window capture mentioned earlier, and the new hotkey registration through SharpHook).
  - Feature: GUI - Make JSON settings visible on "Settings (JSON)" page. Cannot be saved yet.
  - Feature: GUI - Suspend key presses when the hotkey field has focus (for Windows, only works with the SharpHook hotkey registration for now) #66.
  - Feature: New hotkey registration subsystem through the use of SharpHook, which allows binding the "Windows" modifier on Windows.
  - Feature: User events - Run command when an event is fired (such as when an app toggles on or off) (thanks to Sergio Compean, #181).
  - Refactor: Docs - Unified much of the documentation around settings, to use the same (comment based) data source across the GUI, the documentation page, and the JSON schema.
  - Refactor: Docs - Updated documentation page.
  - Refactor: Tweaked log levels to be less verbose (thanks to Maarten).
  - Refactor: Windows - Reworked how window handles are found. Before, a process was looked up, and its main window could be attached to. Now, the search process starts at the list of available windows, regardless of process.
