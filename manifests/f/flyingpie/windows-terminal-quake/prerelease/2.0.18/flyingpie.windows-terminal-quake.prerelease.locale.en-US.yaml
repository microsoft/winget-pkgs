ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Bugfix: Updated example for "Process Explorer" to correct start- and attach to new instance.
  - Bugfix: Updated CLI to load settings and fetch listening endpoint.
  - Bugfix: When a window gets minimized, WTQ could not longer toggle it.
  - Bugfix: When adding an app without any matching criteria, any window would be attached to (now only attaches when at least 1 criterion is present).
  - Feature: "Resize" option (defaults to "Always"), can be used to disable resizing the app's window (disables alignment settings). Useful for apps that don't respond well to being resized, like some Electron apps.
    "Apps": [
      {
        "Resize": "Always | Never"
      }
    ]
  }
  - Feature: GUI - "Off-Screen Locations" can now be configured from the GUI.
