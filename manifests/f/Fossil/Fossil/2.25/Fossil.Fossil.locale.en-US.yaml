ReleaseNotes: |-
  - The "fossil ui /" command now works even for repositories that have non-ASCII filenames
  - Add the fossil tree command.
  - On case-insensitive filesystems, store files using the filesystem's preferred case rather than the case typed in by the user.
  - Change the name "fossil cherry-pick" command to "fossil cherrypick", which is more familiar to Git users. Retain the legacy name for compatibility.
  - Add new query parameters to the /timeline page: d2=, p2=, and dp2=.
  - Add options to the fossil tag command that will list tag values.
  - Add the -b|--brief option to the fossil status command.
  - Add ability to upload unversioned files via the /uvlist page.
  - Add history search to the /chat page.
  - Add Unix socket support to the server command.
  - On Windows, use the root certificates managed by the operating system (requires OpenSSL 3.2.0 or greater).
  - Take into account zero-width and double-width unicode characters when formatting the command-line timeline.
  - Update the built-in SQLite to version 3.47.0. Precompiled binaries are linked against OpenSSL 3.4.0.
  - Numerous minor fixes and additions.
