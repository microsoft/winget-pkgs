ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Added the chat-timeline-user setting. If it is not an empty string, then any changes that would appear on the timeline are announced in the chat room.
  - The /unsubscribe page now requests confirmation. Email notifications now contain only an "Unsubscribe" link, and not a link to subscription management.
  - Added the "fossil branch lsh" subcommand to list the most recently modified branches.
  - More elements of the /info page are now inside of an accordion.
  - Replace the --dryrun flag with --dry-run in all commands which still used the former name, for consistency.
  - Rebuilt the stock Dockerfile to create a "from scratch" Busybox based container image via an Alpine Linux intermediary
  - Added a new document describing how to customize, use, and run that container.
  - Added "by hour of day" report to the /reports page.
  - Improved correctness, usability, and efficiency for the case when values in a TICKET's column tend to be long and volatile.
  - Fixed a bug introduced in 2.17 that prevented clone --unversioned from completing the retrieval of UV files from the remote repo.
    While fixing that, enabled UV tracing output with clone --unversioned --verbose, making it consonant with uv sync --verbose.
