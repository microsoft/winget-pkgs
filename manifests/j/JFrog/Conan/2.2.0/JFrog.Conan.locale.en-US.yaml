ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Feature: Raise for toolchains different than CMakeToolchain if using universal binary syntax. (
  - Feature: Warn on misplaced requirement function calls (
  - Feature: Print options conflicts in the graph caused by different branches recipes defining options values. ( Docs: :page_with_curl:
  - Feature: Add macOS versions 14.2, 14.3, 14.4 to settings.yml. ( Docs: :page_with_curl:
  - Feature: New graph html: more information, test-requires, hiding/showing different packages (build, test). ( Docs: :page_with_curl:
  - Feature: Add --backup-sources flag to conan cache clean. (
  - Feature: Add conan graph outdated command that lists the dependencies that have newer versions in remotes ( Docs: :page_with_curl:
  - Feature: Set CMAKE_VS_DEBUGGER_ENVIRONMENT from CMakeToolchain to point to all binary directories when using Visual Studio. This negates the need to copy DLLs to launch executables from the Visual Studio IDE (requires CMake 3.27 or newer). ( Docs: :page_with_curl:
  - Feature: Add a parameter to trim_conandata to avoid raising an exception when conandata.yml file doesn't exist. ( Docs: :page_with_curl:
  - Feature: Added build_context_folder  to PkgConfigDeps. ( Docs: :page_with_curl:
  - Feature: Included build.pkg_config_path  in the built-in options section in the MesonToolchain template. ( Docs: :page_with_curl:
  - Feature: Update _meson_cpu_family_map to support arm64ec. (
  - Feature: Added support for Clang 18. ( Docs: :page_with_curl:
  - Feature: Add basic support in CMakeToolchain for universal binaries. ( Docs: :page_with_curl:
  - Feature: New tools.cmake.cmake_layout:build_folder config that allows re-defining cmake_layout local build-folder. ( Docs: :page_with_curl:
  - Feature: New tools.cmake.cmake_layout:test_folder config that allows re-defining cmake_layout output build folder for test_package, including a $TMP placeholder to create a temporary folder in system tmp. ( Docs: :page_with_curl:
  - Feature: (Experimental) Add conan config install-pkg myconf/[*] new configuration inside Conan packages with new package_type = "configuration". ( Docs: :page_with_curl:
  - Feature: (Experimental) New core.package_id:config_mode that allows configuration package reference to affect the package_id of all packages built with that configuration. ( Docs: :page_with_curl:
  - Feature: Make cppstd_flag public to return the corresponding C++ standard flag based on the settings. ( Docs: :page_with_curl:
  - Feature: Allow self.name and self.version in build_folder_vars attribute and conf. ( Docs: :page_with_curl:
  - Feature: Add conan list --filter-xxx arguments to list package binaries that match settings+options. ( Docs: :page_with_curl:
  - Feature: Add detect_libc to the detect_api to get the name and version of the C library. ( Docs: :page_with_curl:
  - Feature: New CommandAPI subapi in the ConanAPI that allows calling other commands. ( Docs: :page_with_curl:
  - Fix: Avoid unnecessary build of tool_requires when --build=missing and repeated tool_requires. (
  - Fix: Fix CMakeDeps set_property(... APPEND argument order. (
  - Fix: Raising an error when an infinite loop is found in the install graph (ill-formed dependency graph with loops). (
  - Fix: Make sure detect_default_compiler() always returns a 3-tuple. (
  - Fix: Print a clear message for conan graph explain when no binaries exist for one revision. (
  - Fix: Add package_type="static-library" to the conan new msbuild_lib template. (
  - Fix: Avoid platform_requires to fail when explicit options are being passed via requires(.., options={}). (
  - Fix: Make CMakeToolchain end with newline. (
  - Fix: Do not allow conan list binary filters or package query if a binary pattern is not provided. (
  - Fix: Avoid CMakeToolchain.preprocessor_definition definitions to "None" literal string when it  has no value (Python None). (
  - Fix: Improved conan install <path> --deployer-package=* case that was crashing when using self.package_folder. (
  - Fix: Fix conan graph info --format=html for large dependency graphs. (
  - Fix: Make all recipe and plugins python file print() to stderr, so json outputs to stdout are not broken. (
  - Fix: Fix getting the gnu triplet for Linux x86. (
  - Bugfix: Solve backslash issues with conan_home_folder in global.conf when used in strings inside lists. (
  - Bugfix: Fix CMakeDeps multi-config when there are conditional dependencies on the build_type. (
  - Bugfix: Move get_backup_sources() method to expected CacheAPI from UploadAPI. (
  - Bugfix: Avoid TypeError when a version in conandata.yml lists no patches. (
  - Bugfix: Solve package_type=build-scripts issue with lockfiles and conan create. (
  - Bugfix: Allow --channel command line argument if the recipe specifies user attribute. (
  - Bugfix: Fix cross-compilation to Android from Windows when using MesonToolchain. (
  - Bugfix: Fix CMakeToolchain GENERATOR_TOOLSET when compiler.update is defined. (
  - Bugfix: Solved evaluation of conf items when they matched a Python module (
  - Bugfix: Fix PkgConfigDeps generating .pc files for its tool_requires when it is in the build context already. (
  - Bugfix: Adding VISIBILITY flags to CONAN_C_FLAGS too. (
  - Bugfix: Fix conan profile show --format=json for profiles with scoped confs. (
