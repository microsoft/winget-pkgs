  About
  jj is a Git-compatible version control system that is both simple and powerful. See
  the installation instructions to get started.
  Breaking changes
  - In revsets, symbol expressions (such as change ID prefix) no longer resolve to
    multiple revisions, and error out if resolved to more than one revisions. Use
    change_id(prefix) or bookmarks(exact:name) to query divergent changes or
    conflicted bookmarks. Commands like jj rebase no longer require all: to
    specify multiple destination revisions.
  - jj op abandon now discards previous versions of a change (or predecessors)
    if they become unreachable from the operation history. The evolution history
    is truncated accordingly.
    Once jj op abandon and jj util gc are run in a repository, old versions of
    jj might get "commit not found" error on jj evolog.
  - commit.working_copies() template method now returns List<WorkspaceRef>
  - The previously predefined amend alias has been removed. You can restore it
    by setting the config aliases.amend = ["squash"].
  Deprecations
  - The all: revset modifier and ui.always-allow-large-revsets setting is
    planned to be removed in a future release.
    #6016
  - Rename the core.fsmonitor and core.watchman settings to
    fsmonitor.backend, and fsmonitor.watchman respectively.
  New features
  - jj workspace list now accepts -T/--template option to customize its
    output via templates.
  - Added templates.workspace_list template to customize the output of
    jj workspace list.
  - jj fix now buffers the standard error stream from subprocesses and emits
    the output from each all at once. The file name is printed before the output.
  - jj status now collapses fully untracked directories into one line.
    It still fully traverses them while snapshotting but they won't clutter up
    the output with all of their contents.
  - Add the working-copy.eol-conversion config which is similar to the git
    core.autocrlf config. A heuristics is used to detect if a file is a binary
    file to prevent the EOL conversion from changing binary files unexpectedly.
  - Add a .parents() method to the
    Operation type in the templating
    language.
  - Merge tools config can now explicitly forbid using them as diff editors or
    diff formatters. Built-in tools that do not function well as diff editing
    tools or as diff formatters will now report an error when used as such.
  - jj diffedit now accepts filesets to edit only the specified paths.
  - AnnotationLine objects in templates now have a original_line_number() -> Integer method.
  - Commit templates now support .files() to list all existing files at that
    revision.
  - Glob patterns now support {foo,bar} syntax. There may be subtle behavior
    changes as we use the globset library now.
  - The new bisect(x) revset function can help bisect a range of commits to
    find when a bug was introduced.
  - New first_parent() and first_ancestors() revset functions which are
    similar to parents() and ancestors(), but only traverse the first parent
    of each commit (similar to Git's --first-parent option).
  - New signing.backends.ssh.revocation-list config for specifying a list of revoked
    public keys for commit signature verification.
  - jj fix commands now replace $root with the workspace's root path. This is
    useful for tools stored inside the workspace.
  Fixed bugs
  - Fixed an error in jj util gc caused by the empty blob being missing from
    the Git store. #7062
  - jj op diff -p and jj op log -p now show content diffs from the first
    predecessor only. #7090
  - jj git fetch no longer shows NaN% progress when connecting to slow remotes.
    #7155
