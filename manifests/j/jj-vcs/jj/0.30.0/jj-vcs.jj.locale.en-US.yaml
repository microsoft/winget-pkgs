  About
  jj is a Git-compatible version control system that is both simple and powerful. See the installation instructions to get started.
  Release highlights
  - The experimental support from release 0.29.0 for transferring the change ID
    to/from Git remotes has been enabled by default. The change ID is stored in
    the Git commit itself (in a commit header called change-id), which means
    it will be transferred by regular git push etc. Please let us know if you
    run into any problems with it. You can disable it setting
    git.write-change-id-header. Note that some Git remotes (e.g GitLab) and
    some Git commands (e.g. git rebase) do not preserve the change ids when
    they rewrite commits.
  - jj rebase now automatically abandons divergent commits if another commit
    with the same change ID is already present in the destination with identical
    changes.
  - jj split has gained --message, --insert-before, --insert-after, and
    --destination options.
  - jj evolog can show associated operations for commits created by new jj
    versions.
  Breaking changes
  - The old libgit2 code path for fetches and pushes has been removed,
    and the git.subprocess setting along with it.
  - In templates, bookmark/tag/remote names are now formatted in revset symbol
    notation. The type of bookmark.remote() is changed to Option<_>.
    bookmark.remote() == "foo" still works, but bookmark.remote().<method>()
    might need if(bookmark.remote(), ..) to suppress error.
  - jj rebase now automatically abandons divergent commits if another commit
    with the same change ID is already present in the destination with identical
    changes. To keep these divergent commits, use the --keep-divergent flag.
  - The deprecated --skip-empty flag for jj rebase has been removed. Use the
    --skip-emptied flag instead.
  - The deprecated jj branch subcommands have been removed. Use the jj bookmark subcommands instead.
  - jj util completion now requires the name of the shell as a positional
    argument and no longer produces Bash completions by default. The deprecated
    optional arguments for different shells have been removed.
  Deprecations
  - The ui.diff.format and ui.diff.tool config options have been merged as
    ui.diff-formatter. The builtin format can be specified as :<format>
    (e.g. ui.diff-formatter=":git" for Git diffs.)
  - The .normal_hex() method will be removed from the CommitId template type.
    It's useful only for the ChangeId type.
  New features
  - jj split has gained a --message option to set the description of the
    commit with the selected changes.
  - jj split has gained the ability to place the revision with the selected
    changes anywhere in the revision tree with the --insert-before,
    --insert-after and --destination command line flags.
  - Added git.track-default-bookmark-on-clone setting to control whether to
    track the default remote bookmark on jj git clone.
  - Templates can now do arithmetic on integers with the +, -, *, /, and
    % infix operators.
  - Evolution history is now stored in the operation log. jj evolog can show
    associated operations for commits created by new jj versions.
  Fixed bugs
  - Work around a git issue that could cause subprocess operations to hang if the
    core.fsmonitor gitconfig is set in the global or system gitconfigs.
    #6440
  - jj parallelize can now parallelize groups of changes that start with an
    immutable change, but do not contain any other immutable changes.
  - jj will no longer warn about deprecated paths on macOS if the configured
    XDG directory is the deprecated one (~/Library/Application Support).
  - The builtin diff editor now correctly handles splitting changes where a file
    is replaced by a directory of the same name.
    #5189
  Packaging changes
  - Due to the removal of the libgit2 code path, packagers should remove any
    dependencies on libgit2, libssh2, Zlib, OpenSSL, and pkg-config, and
    ensure they are not setting the Cargo git2 or vendored-openssl features.
