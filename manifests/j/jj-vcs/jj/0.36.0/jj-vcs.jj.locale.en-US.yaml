  About
  jj is a Git-compatible version control system that is both simple and powerful. See
  the installation instructions to get started.
  Release highlights
  - The documentation has moved from https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/ to
    https://docs.jj-vcs.dev/.
    301 redirects are being issued towards the new domain, so any existing links
    should not be broken.
  - Fixed race condition that could cause divergent operations when running
    concurrent jj commands in colocated repositories. It is now safe to
    continuously run e.g. jj log without --ignore-working-copy in one
    terminal while you're running other commands in another terminal.
    #6830
  - jj now ignores $PAGER set in the environment and uses less -FRX on most
    platforms (:builtin on Windows). See the docs for
    more information, and #3502 for
    motivation.
  Breaking changes
  - In filesets or path patterns, glob matching
    is enabled by default. You can use cwd:"path" to match literal paths.
  - In the following commands, string pattern
    arguments are now parsed the same way they
    are in revsets and can be combined with logical operators: jj bookmark delete/forget/list/move, jj tag delete/list, jj git clone/fetch/push
  - In the following commands, unmatched bookmark/tag names is no longer an
    error. A warning will be printed instead: jj bookmark delete/forget/move/track/untrack, jj tag delete, jj git clone/push
  - The default string pattern syntax in revsets will be changed to glob: in a
    future release. You can opt in to the new default by setting
    ui.revsets-use-glob-by-default=true.
  - Upgraded scm-record from v0.8.0 to v0.9.0. See release notes at
    https://github.com/arxanas/scm-record/releases/tag/v0.9.0.
  - The minimum supported Rust version (MSRV) is now 1.89.
  - On macOS, the deprecated config directory ~/Library/Application Support/jj
    is not read anymore. Use $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/jj instead (defaults to
    ~/.config/jj).
  - Sub-repos are no longer tracked. Any directory containing .jj or .git
    is ignored. Note that Git submodules are unaffected by this.
  Deprecations
  - The --destination/-d arguments for jj rebase, jj split, jj revert,
    etc. were renamed to --onto/-o. The reasoning is that --onto,
    --insert-before, and --insert-after are all destination arguments, so
    calling one of them --destination was confusing and unclear. The old names
    will be removed at some point in the future, but we realize that they are
    deep in muscle memory, so you can expect an unusually long deprecation period.
  - jj describe --edit is deprecated in favor of --editor.
  - The config options git.auto-local-bookmark and git.push-new-bookmarks are
    deprecated in favor of remotes.<name>.auto-track-bookmarks. For example:
    [remotes.origin]
    auto-track-bookmarks = "glob:*"
    For more details, refer to
    the docs.
  - The flag --allow-new on jj git push is deprecated. In order to push new
    bookmarks, please track them with jj bookmark track. Alternatively, consider
    setting up an auto-tracking configuration to avoid the chore of tracking
    bookmarks manually. For example:
    [remotes.origin]
    auto-track-bookmarks = "glob:*"
    For more details, refer to
    the docs.
  New features
  - jj commit, jj describe, jj squash, and jj split now accept
    --editor, which ensures an editor will be opened with the commit
    description even if one was provided via --message/-m.
  - All jj commands show a warning when the provided fileset expression
    doesn't match any files.
  - Added files() template function to DiffStats. This supports per-file stats
    like lines_added() and lines_removed()
  - Added join() template function. This is different from separate() in that
    it adds a separator between all arguments, even if empty.
  - RepoPath template type now has a absolute() -> String method that returns
    the absolute path as a string.
  - Added format_path(path) template that controls how file paths are printed
    with jj file list.
  - New built-in revset aliases visible() and hidden().
  - Unquoted * is now allowed in revsets. bookmarks(glob:foo*) no longer
    needs quoting.
  - jj prev/next --no-edit now generates an error if the working-copy has some
    children.
  - A new config option remotes.<name>.auto-track-bookmarks can be set to a
    string pattern. New bookmarks matching it will be automatically tracked for
    the specified remote. See
    the docs.
  - jj log now supports a --count flag to print the number of commits instead
    of displaying them.
  Fixed bugs
  - jj fix now prints a warning if a tool failed to run on a file.
    #7971
  - Shell completion now works with non‑normalized paths, fixing the previous
    panic and allowing prefixes containing . or .. to be completed correctly.
    #6861
  - Shell completion now always uses forward slashes to complete paths, even on
    Windows. This renders completion results viable when using jj in Git Bash.
    #7024
  - Unexpected keyword arguments now return a parse failure for the coalesce()
    and concat() templating functions.
  - Nushell completion script documentation add -f option, to keep it up to
    date.
    #8007
  - Ensured that with Git submodules, remnants of your submodules do not show up
    in the working copy after running jj new.
    #4349
