  About
  jj is a Git-compatible version control system that is both simple and powerful. See
  the installation instructions to get started.
  Release highlights
  - Support for uploading changes to Gerrit Code Review with jj gerrit upload.
    This lets you submit trees or multiple stacks of work at once. Support
    for fetching changes, submitting changes, and other operations is not yet
    implemented. This should be considered experimental, and we welcome feedback
    on using it.
  - Support for automated bisection using jj bisect run; this will continuously
    bisect a commit range until a given commit is found to trigger a bug.
  Breaking changes
  - Git-based repositories are now colocated by default. Configure git.colocate = false to keep the previous behavior.
  - Conflicts written by jj < 0.11 are no longer supported. They will now appear
    as regular files with a .jjconflict suffix and JSON contents.
  - The minimum supported Rust version (MSRV) is now 1.88.
  Deprecations
  - Various flags on jj describe and jj commit have been deprecated in favor
    of jj metaedit. They are:
    - describe: --author, --reset-author, --no-edit
    - commit: --author, --reset-author
  - The storage format of remote bookmarks and tags has changed. Remote bookmarks
    will be written in both old and new formats to retain forward compatibility.
    Git-tracking tags are also recorded for future native tagging support. This
    change should be transparent, but let us know if you see anything odd.
  New features
  - The new command jj bisect run uses binary search to find a commit that
    introduced a bug.
  - The default editor on Unix is now nano instead of pico.
  - New config option merge.hunk-level = "word" to enable word-level merging.
  - New config option merge.same-change = "keep" to disable lossy resolution
    rule for same-change conflicts.
    #6369
  - Templates now support a replace() method on strings for pattern-based
    string replacement with optional limits. Supports all string patterns, including
    regex with capture groups (e.g. "hello world".replace(regex:'(\w+) (\w+)', "$2 $1")).
  - A new builtin hyperlink(url, text) template alias creates clickable
    hyperlinks using OSC8 escape sequences
    for terminals that support them.
  - Added a new conditional configuration --when.platforms to include
    settings only on certain platforms.
  - External diff commands now support substitution variable $width for the
    number of available terminal columns.
  - The new jj gerrit upload command allows you to upload given revisions to an
    instance of Gerrit Code Review.
  - jj bookmark create/set/move use the working copy as a default again and
    no longer require an explicit revision argument. This walks back a
    deprecation from jj 0.26, as the community feedback was mostly negative.
  - The revset function exactly(x, n) will now evaluate x and error if it does
    not have exactly n elements.
  - jj util exec now matches the exit status of the program it runs, and
    doesn't print anything.
  - jj config get now supports displaying array and table config values.
  - jj util exec sets the environment variable JJ_WORKSPACE_ROOT
  Fixed bugs
  - Fetching repositories that have submodules no longer errors even if
    submodule.recurse=true is set in .gitconfig (but jj still isn't able to
    fetch the submodules or to operate on them).
