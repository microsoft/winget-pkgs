  About
  jj is a Git-compatible version control system that is both simple and powerful. See
  the installation instructions to get started.
  Release highlights
  - jj undo is now sequential: invoking it multiple times in sequence
    repeatedly undoes actions in the operation log. Previously, jj undo would
    only undo the most recent operation in the operation log. As a result, a new
    jj redo command has been added.
  - Experimental support for improving query performance over filesets and file
    queries (like jj log path/to/file.txt) has been added. This is not enabled
    by default. To enable this, you must use the jj debug index-changed-paths
    command.
  Breaking changes
  - jj evolog templates now accept CommitEvolutionEntry as context type. To
    get Commit properties, use commit.<method>(). To customize the default
    output, set templates.evolog instead of templates.log.
  - jj op show now uses templates.op_show configuration for its default template
    instead of templates.op_log.
  - The deprecated config option git.auto-local-branch has been removed. Use
    git.auto-local-bookmark instead.
  - The deprecated Signature.username() template method has been removed. Use
    Signature.email().local() instead.
  - The deprecated --config-toml flag has been removed. Use
    --config=NAME=VALUE or --config-file=PATH instead.
  - jj undo can now undo multiple operations progressively by calling it
    repeatedly, whereas previously, running jj undo twice was previously a no-op
    (it only undid the last change).
  - jj git fetch will now only fetch the refspec patterns configured on remotes
    when the --bookmark option is omitted. Only simple refspec patterns are
    currently supported, and anything else (like refspecs which rename branches)
    will be ignored.
  - The conflict label used for coloring log graph nodes was renamed to
    conflicted.
  Deprecations
  - The on-disk index format has changed. jj will write index files in both old
    and new formats, so old jj versions should be able to read these index
    files. This compatibility layer will be removed in a future release.
  - jj op undo is deprecated in favor of jj op revert. (jj undo is still
    available, but with new semantics. See also the breaking changes above.)
  - The argument <operation> of jj undo is deprecated in favor of
    jj op revert <operation>.
  - The --what flag on jj undo is deprecated. Consider using
    jj op restore --what instead.
  New features
  - The new command jj redo can progressively redo operations that were
    previously undone by multiple calls to jj undo.
  - Templates now support any() and all() methods on lists to check whether
    any or all elements satisfy a predicate. Example: parents.any(|c| c.mine())
    returns true if any parent commit is authored by the user.
  - Add experimental support for indexing changed paths, which will speed up jj log PATH query, jj file annotate, etc. The changed-path index can be
    enabled by jj debug index-changed-paths command. Indexing may take tens of
    minutes depending on the number of merge commits. The indexing command UI is
    subject to change. #4674
  - jj config list now supports -T'json(self) ++ "\n"' serialization output.
  - jj file show now accepts -T/--template option to insert file metadata.
  - The template language now allows arbitrary whitespace between any operators.
  - The new configuration option git.colocate=boolean controls whether or not
    Git repositories are colocated by default.
  - Both jj git clone and jj git init now take a --no-colocate flag to
    disable colocation (in case git.colocate is set to true.)
  - jj git remote add and jj git clone now support --fetch-tags to control
    when tags are fetched for all subsequent fetches.
  - jj git fetch now supports --tracked to fetch only tracked bookmarks.
  - jj diff --stat now shows the change in size to binary files.
  - jj interdiff, jj evolog -p, and jj op log -p now show diff of commit
    descriptions.
  - jj log and jj op log output can now be anonymized with the
    builtin_log_redacted and builtin_op_log_redacted templates.
  - jj git init now checks for an upstream remote in addition to origin when
    setting the repository-level trunk() alias. The upstream remote takes
    precedence over origin if both exist.
  - Add the jj metaedit command, which modifies a revision's metadata. This can
    be used to generate a new change-id, which may help resolve some divergences.
    It also has options to modify author name, email and timestamp, as well as to
    modify committer timestamp.
  - Filesets now support case-insensitive glob patterns with the glob-i:,
    cwd-glob-i:, and root-glob-i: pattern kinds. For example, glob-i:"*.rs"
    will match both file.rs and FILE.RS.
  - jj op show now accepts -T/--template option to customize the operation
    output using template expressions, similar to jj op log. Also added
    --no-op-diff flag to suppress the operation diff.
  - A nearly identical string pattern system as revsets is now supported in the
    template language, and is exposed as string.match(pattern).
  Fixed bugs
  - jj git clone now correctly fetches all tags, unless --fetch-tags is
    explicitly specified, in which case the specified option will apply for both
    the initial clone and subsequent fetches.
  - Operation and working-copy state files are now synchronized to disk on save.
    This will mitigate data corruption on system crash.
    #4423
  Packaging changes
  - The test suite no longer optionally uses Taplo CLI or jq, and packagers can
    remove them as dependencies if present.
