  About
  jj is a Git-compatible version control system that is both simple and powerful. See
  the installation instructions to get started.
  Release highlights
  - Workspaces can now have their own separate configuration. For instance, you
    can use jj config set --workspace to update a configuration option only in
    the current workspace.
  - After creating a local bookmark, it is now possible to use jj bookmark track
    to associate the bookmark with a specific remote before pushing it. When
    pushing a tracked bookmark, it is not necessary to use --allow-new.
  - The new jj git colocation enable and jj git colocation disable commands
    allow converting between colocated and non-colocated workspaces.
  Breaking changes
  - The remote_bookmarks(remote=pattern) revset now includes Git-tracking
    bookmarks if the specified pattern matches git. The default is
    remote=~exact:"git" as before.
  - The deprecated flag --summary of jj abandon has been removed.
  - The deprecated command jj backout has been removed, use jj revert instead.
  - The following deprecated config options have been removed:
    - signing.sign-all
    - core.watchman.register_snapshot_trigger
    - diff.format
  Deprecations
  - jj bisect run --command <cmd> is deprecated in favor of
    jj bisect run -- <cmd>.
  - jj metaedit --update-committer-timestamp was renamed to
    jj metaedit --force-rewrite since the old name (and help text)
    incorrectly suggested that the committer name and email would not
    be updated.
  New features
  - Workspaces may have an additional layered configuration, located at
    .jj/workspace-config.toml. jj config subcommands which took layer options
    like --repo now also support --workspace.
  - jj bookmark track can now associate new local bookmarks with remote.
    Tracked bookmarks can be pushed without --allow-new.
    #7072
  - The new jj git colocation command provides sub-commands to show the
    colocation state (status), to convert a non-colocated workspace into
    a colocated workspace (enable), and vice-versa (disable).
  - New jj tag set/delete commands to create/update/delete tags locally.
    Created/updated tags are currently always exported to Git as lightweight
    tags. If you would prefer them to be exported as annotated tags, please give
    us feedback on #7908.
  - Templates now support a .split(separator, [limit]) method on strings to
    split a string into a list of substrings.
  - -G is now available as a short form of --no-graph in jj log, jj evolog,
    jj op log, jj op show and jj op diff.
  - jj metaedit now accepts -m/--message option to non-interactively update
    the change description.
  - The CryptographicSignature.key() template method now also works for SSH
    signatures and returns the corresponding public key fingerprint.
  - Added template-aliases.empty_commit_marker. Users can override this value in
    their config to change the "(empty)" label on empty commits.
  - Add support for --when.workspaces config scopes.
  - Add support for --when.hostnames config scopes. This allows configuration to
    be conditionally applied based on the hostname set in operation.hostname.
  - jj bisect run accepts the command and arguments to pass to the command
    directly as positional arguments, such as
    jj bisect --range=..main -- cargo check --all-targets.
  - Divergent changes are no longer marked red in immutable revisions. Since the
    revision is immutable, the user shouldn't take any action, so the red color
    was unnecessarily alarming.
  - New commit template keywords local/remote_tags to show only local/remote
    tags. These keywords may be useful in non-colocated Git repositories where
    local and exported @git tags can point to different revisions.
  - jj git clone now supports the --branch option to specify the branch(es)
    to fetch during clone. If present, the first matching branch is used as the
    working-copy parent.
  - Revsets now support logical operators in string patterns.
  Fixed bugs
  - jj metaedit --author-timestamp twice with the same value no longer
    edits the change twice in some cases.
  - jj squash: fixed improper revision rebase when both --insert-after and
    --insert-before were used.
  - jj undo can now revert "fetch"/"import" operation that involves tag updates.
    #6325
  - Fixed parsing of files(expr) revset expression including parentheses.
    #7747
  - Fixed jj describe --stdin to append a final newline character.
