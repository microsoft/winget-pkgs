  About
  jj is a Git-compatible version control system that is both simple and powerful. See
  the installation instructions to get started.
  Release highlights
  - A new syntax for referring to hidden and divergent change IDs is available:
    xyz/n where n is a number. For instance, xyz/0 refers to the latest
    version of xyz, while xyz/1 refers to the previous version of xyz.
    This allows you to perform actions like jj restore --from xyz/1 --to xyz to
    restore xyz to its previous contents, if you made a mistake.
    For divergent changes, the numeric suffix will always be shown in the log,
    allowing you to disambiguate them in a similar manner.
  Breaking changes
  - String patterns in revsets, command
    arguments, and configuration are now parsed as globs by default. Use
    substring: or exact: prefix as needed.
  - remotes.<name>.auto-track-bookmarks is now parsed the same way they
    are in revsets and can be combined with logical operators.
  - jj bookmark track/untrack now accepts --remote argument. If omitted, all
    remote bookmarks matching the bookmark names will be tracked/untracked. The
    old <bookmark>@<remote> syntax is deprecated in favor of <bookmark> --remote=<remote>.
  - On Windows, symlinks that point to a path with / won't be supported. This
    path is invalid on Windows.
  - The template alias format_short_change_id_with_hidden_and_divergent_info(commit)
    has been replaced by format_short_change_id_with_change_offset(commit).
  - The following deprecated config options have been removed:
    - git.push-bookmark-prefix
    - ui.default-description
    - ui.diff.format
    - ui.diff.tool
  - The deprecated commit_id.normal_hex() template method has been removed.
  - Template expansion that did not produce a terminating newline will not be
    fixed up to provide one by jj log, jj evolog, or jj op log.
  - The diff conflict marker style can now use \\\\\\\ markers to indicate
    the continuation of a conflict label from the previous line.
  Deprecations
  - The git_head() and git_refs() functions will be removed from revsets and
    templates. git_head() should point to the first_parent(@) revision in
    colocated repositories. git_refs() can be approximated as
    remote_bookmarks(remote=glob:*) | tags().
  New features
  - Updated the executable bit representation in the local working copy to allow
    ignoring executable bit changes on Unix. By default we try to detect the
    filesystem's behavior, but this can be overridden manually by setting
    working-copy.exec-bit-change = "respect" | "ignore".
  - jj workspace add now also works for empty destination directories.
  - jj git remote family of commands now supports different fetch and push URLs.
  - [colors] table now supports dim = true attribute.
  - In color-words diffs, context line numbers are now rendered with decreased
    intensity.
  - Hidden and divergent commits can now be unambiguously selected using their
    change ID combined with a numeric suffix. For instance, if there are two
    commits with change ID xyz, then one can be referred to as xyz/0 and the
    other can be referred to as xyz/1. These suffixes are shown in the log when
    necessary to make a change ID unambiguous.
  - jj util gc now prunes unreachable files in .jj/repo/store/extra to save
    disk space.
  - Early version of a jj file search command for searching for a pattern in
    files (like git grep).
  - Conflict labels now contain information about where the sides of a conflict
    came from (e.g. nlqwxzwn 7dd24e73 "first line of description").
  - --insert-before now accepts a revset that resolves to an empty set when
    used with --insert-after. The behavior is similar to --onto.
  - jj tag list now supports --sort option.
  - TreeDiffEntry type now has a display_diff_path() method that formats
    renames/copies appropriately.
  - TreeDiffEntry now has a status_char() method that returns
    single-character status codes (M/A/D/C/R).
  - CommitEvolutionEntry type now has a predecessors() method which
    returns the predecessor commits (previous versions) of the entry's commit.
  - CommitEvolutionEntry type now has a inter_diff() method which
    returns a TreeDiff between the entry's commit and its predecessor version.
    Optionally accepts a fileset literal to limit the diff.
  - jj file annotate now reports an error for non-files instead of succeeding
    and displaying no content.
  - jj workspace forget now warns about unknown workspaces instead of failing.
  Fixed bugs
  - Broken symlink on Windows. #6934.
  - Fixed failure on exporting moved/deleted annotated tags to Git. Moved tags are
    exported as lightweight tags.
  - jj gerrit upload now correctly handles mixed explicit and implicit
    Change-Ids in chains of commits (#8219)
  - jj git push now updates partially-pushed remote bookmarks accordingly.
    #6787
  - Fixed problem of loading large Git packfiles.
    GitoxideLabs/gitoxide#2265
  - The builtin pager won't get stuck when stdin is redirected.
  - jj workspace add now prevents creating an empty workspace name.
  - Fixed checkout of symlinks pointing to themselves or .git/.jj on Unix. The
    problem would still remain on Windows if symlinks are enabled.
    #8348
  - Fixed a bug where jj would fail to read git delta objects from pack files.
    GitoxideLabs/gitoxide#2344
