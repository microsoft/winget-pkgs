      About
      - jj is a Git-compatible version control system that is both simple and powerful. See the installation instructions to get started.
      Release highlights
      - New `jj absorb` command automatically squashes changes from the current commit into relevant ancestor commits.
      - Experimental dynamic shell completions have been added; see the docs for configuration.
      - `jj duplicate` now accepts `--destination`/`--insert-before`/`--insert-after`.
      - Some deprecated commands have been removed (`jj move`, `jj checkout`, `jj merge`).
      Breaking changes
      - `jj move` has been removed. It was deprecated in 0.16.0.
      - `jj checkout` and the built-in alias `jj co` have been removed.
      - It was deprecated in 0.14.0.
      - `jj merge` has been removed. It was deprecated in 0.14.0.
      - `jj git push` no longer pushes new bookmarks by default. Use `--allow-new` to
      - bypass this restriction.
      - Lines prefixed with "JJ:" in commit descriptions and in sparse patterns (from
        `jj sparse edit`) are now stripped even if they are not immediately followed
      - by a space. #5004
      Deprecations
      New features
      - Templates now support the `==` and `!=` logical operators for `Boolean`,
        `Integer`, and `String` types.
      - New command `jj absorb` that moves changes to stack of mutable revisions.
      - New command `jj util exec` that can be used for arbitrary aliases.
      - `jj rebase -b` can now be used with the `--insert-after` and `--insert-before`
      - options, like `jj rebase -r` and `jj rebase -s`.
      - A preview of improved shell completions was added. Please refer to the
      - documentation
      - to activate them. They additionally complete context-dependent, dynamic values
      - like bookmarks, aliases, revisions, operations and files.
      - Added the config setting `snapshot.auto-update-stale` for automatically
      - running `jj workspace update-stale` when applicable.
      - `jj duplicate` now accepts `--destination`, `--insert-after` and
        `--insert-before` options to customize the location of the duplicated
      - revisions.
      - `jj log` now displays the working-copy branch first.
      - New `fork_point()` revset function can be used to obtain the fork point
      - of multiple commits.
      - The `tags()` revset function now takes an optional `pattern` argument,
      - mirroring that of `bookmarks()`.
      - Several commands now support `-f/-t` shorthands for `--from/--to`:
      - `diff`
      - `diffedit`
      - `interdiff`
      - `op diff`
      - `restore`
      - New `ui.conflict-marker-style` config option to change how conflicts are
      - materialized in the working copy. The default option ("diff") renders
      - conflicts as a snapshot with a list of diffs to apply to the snapshot.
      - The new "snapshot" option renders conflicts as a series of snapshots, showing
      - each side and base of the conflict. The new "git" option replicates Git's
        "diff3" conflict style, meaning it is more likely to work with external tools,
      - but it doesn't support conflicts with more than 2 sides.
      - New `merge-tools.<TOOL>.conflict-marker-style` config option to override the
      - conflict marker style used for a specific merge tool.
      - New `merge-tools.<TOOL>.merge-conflict-exit-codes` config option to allow a
      - merge tool to exit with a non-zero code to indicate that not all conflicts
      - were resolved.
      - `jj simplify-parents` now supports configuring the default revset when no
         `--source` or `--revisions` arguments are provided with the
         `revsets.simplify-parents` config.
      Fixed bugs
      - `jj config unset <TABLE-NAME>` no longer removes a table (such as `[ui]`.)
