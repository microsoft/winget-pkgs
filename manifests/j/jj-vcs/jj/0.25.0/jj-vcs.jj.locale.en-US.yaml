      About
      - jj is a Git-compatible version control system that is both simple and powerful. See the installation instructions to get started.
      Release highlights
      - It's the holidays, and this release was overall pretty quiet, without many major
      - changes. Two select improvements:
      - Improvements to configuration management, including support for [conditional
      - variables](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/v0.25.0/config#conditional-variables) in config files.
      - Large files in the working copy will no longer cause commands to fail; instead
      - the large files will remain intact but untracked in the working copy.
      Breaking changes
      - Configuration variables are no longer "stringly" typed. For example, `true` is
      - not converted to a string `"true"`, and vice versa.
      - The following configuration variables are now parsed strictly:
        `colors.<labels>`, `git.abandon-unreachable-commits`,
        `git.auto-local-bookmark`, `git.push-bookmark-prefix`, `revsets.log`,
        `revsets.short-prefixes` `signing.backend`, `operation.hostname`,
        `operation.username`, `ui.allow-init-native`, `ui.color`,
        `ui.default-description`, `ui.progress-indicator`, `ui.quiet`, `user.email`,
        `user.name`
      - `jj config list` now prints inline tables `{ key = value, .. }` literally.
      - Inner items of inline tables are no longer merged across configuration files.
      - See the table syntax documentation for details.
      - `jj config edit --user` now opens a file even if `$JJ_CONFIG` points to a
      - directory. If there are multiple config files, the command will fail.
      - `jj config set` no longer accepts a bare string value that looks like a TOML
      - expression. For example, `jj config set NAME '[foo]'` must be quoted as `jj
      - config set NAME '"[foo]"'`.
      - The deprecated `[alias]` config section is no longer respected. Move command
      - aliases to the `[aliases]` section.
      - `jj absorb` now abandons the source commit if it becomes empty and has no
      - description.
      Deprecations
      - `--config-toml=TOML` is deprecated in favor of `--config=NAME=VALUE` and
        `--config-file=PATH`.
      - The `Signature.username()` template method is deprecated for
        `Signature().email().local()`.
      New features
      - `jj` command no longer fails due to new working-copy files larger than the
        `snapshot.max-new-file-size` config option. It will print a warning and large
      - files will be left untracked.
      - Configuration files now support conditional variables.
      - New command options `--config=NAME=VALUE` and `--config-file=PATH` to set
      - string value without quoting and to load additional configuration from files.
      - Templates now support the `>=`, `>`, `<=`, and `<` relational operators for
        `Integer` types.
      - A new Email template type is added. `Signature.email()` now returns an Email
      - template type instead of a String.
      - Adds a new template alias `commit_timestamp(commit)` which defaults to the
      - committer date.
      - Conflict markers are now allowed to be longer than 7 characters, allowing
      - conflicts to be materialized and parsed correctly in files which already
      - contain lines that look like conflict markers.
      - New `$marker_length` variable to allow merge tools to support longer conflict
      - markers (equivalent to "%L" for Git merge drivers).
      - `jj describe` now accepts a `JJ: ignore-rest` line that ignores everything
      - below it, similar to a "scissor line" in git. When editing multiple commits,
      - only ignore until the next `JJ: describe` line.
      Fixed bugs
      - The `$NO_COLOR` environment variable must now be non-empty to be respected.
      - Fixed incompatible rendering of empty hunks in git/unified diffs. #5049
      - Fixed performance of progress bar rendering when fetching from Git remote. #5057
      - `jj config path --user` no longer creates new file at the default config path.
      - On Windows, workspace paths (printed by `jj root`) no longer use UNC-style
        `\\?\` paths unless necessary.
      - On Windows, `jj git clone` now converts local Git remote path to
      - slash-separated path.
      - `jj resolve` no longer removes the executable bit on resolved files when using
      - an external merge tool.
