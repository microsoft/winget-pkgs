  About
  - jj is a Git-compatible version control system that is both simple and powerful. See the installation instructions to get started.
  Release highlights
  - Improved Git push/fetch compatibility by spawning an external `git` process.
  - This can be enabled by the `git.subprocess=true` config knob, and will be the
  - default in a future release.
  - `jj log` can now show cryptographic commit signatures. The output can be
  - controlled by the `ui.show-cryptographic-signatures=true` config knob.
  Breaking changes
  - `jj abandon` now deletes bookmarks pointing to the revisions to be abandoned.
  - Use `--retain-bookmarks` to move bookmarks backwards. If deleted bookmarks
  - were tracking remote bookmarks, the associated bookmarks (or branches) will be
  - deleted from the remote on `jj git push --all`.
    #3505
  - `jj init --git` and `jj init --git-repo` have been removed. They were
  - deprecated in early 2024. Use `jj git init` instead.
  - The following deprecated commands have been removed:
  - `jj cat` is replaced by `jj file show`.
  - `jj chmod` is replaced by `jj file chmod`.
  - `jj files` is replaced by `jj file list`.
  - The deprecated `-l` short alias for `--limit` in `jj log`, `jj op log`
  - and `jj obslog` has been removed. The `-n` short alias can be used instead.
  - The deprecated `--siblings` options for `jj split` has been removed.
    `jj split --parallel` can be used instead.
  - The deprecated `fix.tool-command` config option has been removed.
  - In colocated repos, the Git index now contains the changes from all parents
  - of the working copy instead of just the first parent (`HEAD`). 2-sided
  - conflicts from the merged parents are now added to the Git index as conflicts
  - as well.
  - The following change introduced in 0.25.0 is reverted:
  - `jj config list` now prints inline tables `{ key = value, .. }` literally.
  - Inner items of inline tables are no longer merged across configuration
  - files.
  - `jj resolve` will now attempt to resolve all conflicted files instead of
  - resolving the first conflicted file. To resolve a single file, pass a file
  - path to `jj resolve`.
  - `jj util mangen` is replaced with `jj util install-man-pages`, which can
  - install man pages for all `jj` subcommands to a given path.
  - In `jj config list` template, `value` is now typed as `ConfigValue`, not as
    `String` serialized in TOML syntax.
  - `jj git remote add`/`set-url` now converts relative Git remote path to
  - absolute path.
  - `jj log`/`op log` now applies `-n`/`--limit` *before* the items are reversed.
  - Rationale: It's more useful to see the N most recent commits/operations, and
  - is more performant. The old behavior can be achieved by `jj log .. | head`.
    #5403
  - Upgraded `scm-record` from v0.4.0 to v0.5.0. See release notes at
    <https://github.com/arxanas/scm-record/releases/tag/v0.5.0>.
  - The builtin pager is switched to
  - streampager. It can handle large
  - inputs better and can be configured.
  - Conflicts materialized in the working copy before `jj 0.19.0` may no longer
  - be parsed correctly. If you are using version 0.18.0 or earlier, check out a
  - non-conflicted commit before upgrading to prevent issues.
  Deprecations
  New features
  - `jj git {push,clone,fetch}` can now spawn an external `git` subprocess, via
  - the `git.subprocess = true` config knob. This provides an alternative that,
  - when turned on, fixes SSH bugs when interacting with Git remotes due to
     `libgit2`s limitations #4979.
  - `jj describe` now accepts `--edit`.
  - `jj evolog` and `jj op log` now accept `--reversed`.
  - `jj restore` now supports `-i`/`--interactive` selection.
  - `jj file list` now supports templating.
  - There is a new `builtin_op_log_oneline` template alias you can pass to `jj op
  - log -T` for a more compact output. You can use `format_operation_oneline` and
    `format_snapshot_operation_oneline` to customize parts of it.
  - New template function `config(name)` to access to configuration variable from
  - template.
  - New template function `pad_centered()` to center content within a minimum
  - width.
  - Templater now supports `list.filter(|x| ..)` method.
  - The `diff` commit template keyword now supports custom formatting via
    `diff.files()`. For example, `diff.files().map(|e| e.path().display())` prints
  - changed file paths.
  - The `diff.stat()` template method now provides methods to get summary values.
  - `jj log` can now show cryptographic commit signatures. The output can be
  - controlled by the `ui.show-cryptographic-signatures=true` config knob. The
  - signature template can be customized using
    `format_detailed_cryptographic_signature(signature)` and
    `format_short_cryptographic_signature(signature)`.
  - New `git.sign-on-push` config option to automatically sign commits which are
  - being pushed to a Git remote.
  - New `git.push-new-bookmarks` config option to push new bookmarks without
    `--allow-new`.
  - `jj status` now shows untracked files when they reside directly under a
  - tracked directory. There's still an issue that files under untracked
  - directories aren't listed. #5389
  - New `merge-tools.<TOOL>.diff-expected-exit-codes` config option to suppress
  - warnings from tools exiting with non-zero exit codes.
  - New `fix.tools.TOOL.enabled` config option to enable/disable tools. This is
  - useful for defining disabled tools in user configuration that can be enabled
  - in individual repositories with one config setting.
  - Added `--into` flag to `jj restore`, similarly to `jj squash` and `jj
  - absorb`. It is equivalent to `--to`, but `--into` is the recommended name.
  - Italic text is now supported. You can set e.g. `color.error = { fg = "red",
  - italic = true }` in your config.
  - New `author_name`/`author_email`/`committer_name`/`committer_email(pattern)`
  - revset functions to match either name or email field explicitly.
  - New `subject(pattern)` revset function that matches first line of commit
  - descriptions.
  - Conditional configuration now supports `--when.commands` to change
  - configuration based on subcommand.
  - The Jujutsu documentation site now publishes a schema for the official
  - configuration file, which can be integrated into your editor for autocomplete,
  - inline errors, and more.
  - Please see the documentation for more
  - on this.
  Fixed bugs
  - `jj git fetch` with multiple remotes will now fetch from all remotes before
  - importing refs into the jj repo. This fixes a race condition where the
  - treatment of a commit that is found in multiple fetch remotes depended on the
  - order the remotes were specified.
  - Fixed diff selection by external tools with `jj split`/`commit -i FILESETS`.
    #5252
  - Conditional configuration now applies when initializing new repository.
    #5144
  - `[diff.<format>]` configuration now applies to `.diff().<format>()` commit
  - template methods.
  - Conflicts at the end of files which don't end with a newline character are
  - now materialized in a way that can be parsed correctly.
    #3968
  - Bookmark and remote names written by `jj git clone` to
    `revset-aliases.'trunk()'` are now escaped if necessary.
    #5359
