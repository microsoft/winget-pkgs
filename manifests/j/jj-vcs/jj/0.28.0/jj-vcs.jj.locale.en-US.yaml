  About
    jj is a Git-compatible version control system that is both simple and powerful. See the installation instructions to get started.

  Release highlights
  - jj's configuration can now be split into multiple files more easily.
  - `jj resolve` now accepts built-in tools `:ours` and `:theirs`.
  - In colocated repos, newly-created files will now appear in `git diff`.
  - A long-standing bug relating to empty files in the built-in diff editor was
    fixed. #3702

  Breaking changes
  - The minimum supported Rust version (MSRV) is now 1.84.0.
  - The `git.push-branch-prefix` config has been removed in favor of
    `git.push-bookmark-prefix`.
  - `jj abandon` no longer supports `--summary` to suppress the list of abandoned
    commits. The list won't show more than 10 commits to not clutter the console.
  - `jj unsquash` has been removed in favor of `jj squash` and
    `jj diffedit --restore-descendants`.
  - The `jj untrack` subcommand has been removed in favor of `jj file untrack`.
  - The following deprecated revset functions have been removed:
  - `branches()`, `remote_branches()`, `tracked_remote_branches()`, and
    `untracked_remote_branches()`, which were renamed to "bookmarks".
  - `file()` and `conflict()`, which were renamed to plural forms.
  - `files(x, y, ..)` with multiple patterns. Use `files(x|y|..)` instead.
  - The following deprecated template functions have been removed:
  - `branches()`, `local_branches()`, and `remote_branches()`, which were
    renamed to "bookmarks".
  - The flags `--all` and `--tracked` on `jj git push` by themself do not cause
    deleted bookmarks to be pushed anymore, as an additional safety measure. They
    can now be combined with `--deleted` instead.

  Deprecations
  - `core.watchman.register_snapshot_trigger` has been renamed to `core.watchman.register-snapshot-trigger` for consistency with other configuration options.
  - `jj backout` is deprecated in favor of `jj revert`.

  New features
  - `jj sign` can now sign with PKCS#12 certificates through the `gpgsm` backend.
  - `jj sign` will automatically use the gpg key associated with the author's email
    in the absence of a `signing.key` configuration.
  - Multiple user configs are now supported and are loaded in the following precedence order:
  - `$HOME/.jjconfig.toml`
  - `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/jj/config.toml`
  - `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/jj/conf.d/*.toml`
  - The `JJ_CONFIG` environment variable can now contain multiple paths separated
    by a colon (or semicolon on Windows).
  - The command `jj config list` now supports showing the origin of each variable
    via the `builtin_config_list_detailed` template.
  - `jj config {edit,set,unset}` now prompt when multiple config files are found.
  - `jj diff -r` now allows multiple revisions (as long as there are no gaps in
    the revset), such as `jj diff -r 'mutable()'`.
  - `jj git push` now accepts a `--named NAME=REVISION` argument to create a named
    bookmark and immediately push it.
  - The 'how to resolve conflicts' hint that is shown when conflicts appear can
    be hidden by setting `hints.resolving-conflicts = false`.
  - `jj op diff` and `jj op log --op-diff` now show changes to which commits
    correspond to working copies.
  - `jj op log -d` is now an alias for `jj op log --op-diff`.
  - `jj bookmark move --to/--from` can now be abbreviated to `jj bookmark move -t/-f`
  - `jj bookmark list` now supports `--sort` option. Similar to `git branch --sort`.
    See `jj bookmark list --help` for more details.
  - A new command `jj revert` is added, which is similar to `jj backout` but
    adds the `--destination`, `--insert-after`, and `--insert-before` options to
    customize the location of reverted commits.
  - A new command `jj git root` is added, which prints the location of the Git
    directory of a repository using the Git backend.
  - In colocated repos, any files that jj considers added in the working copy will
    now show up in `git diff` (as if you had run `git add --intent-to-add` on
    them).
  - Reversing colors is now supported. For example, to highlight words by
    reversing colors rather than underlining, you can set
    `colors."diff token"={ underline = false, reverse = true }` in your config.
  - Added `revsets.log-graph-prioritize`, which can be used to configure
    which branch in the `jj log` graph is displayed on the left instead of `@`
    (e.g. `coalesce(description("megamerge\n"), trunk())`)
  - `jj resolve` now accepts new built-in merge tools `:ours` and `:theirs`.
    These merge tools accept side #1 and side #2 of the conflict respectively.

  Fixed bugs
  - `jj log -p --stat` now shows diff stats as well as the default color-words/git
    diff output. #5986
  - The built-in diff editor now correctly handles deleted files.
    #3702
  - The built-in diff editor now correctly retains the executable bit on newly
    added files when splitting. #3846
  - `jj config set`/`--config` value parsing rule is relaxed in a way that
    unquoted apostrophes are allowed.
    #5748
  - `jj fix` could previously create new conflicts when a descendant of a fixed
    revision was already correctly formatted.
