  Changelog (since v1.8.0)
  Change log
  - Added: more key names
  - Added(macOS): add missing mappings for F keys
  - Fix(macOS): allow devices null product strings, preventing some crashes
  - Fix(Windows): fix screenshot output for non-scancode read with scancode output (default binary behaviour)
  Sample configuration file
  The attached kanata.kbd file is tested to work with the current version. The one in the main branch of the repository may have extra features that are not supported in this release.
  Windows
  Instructions
  NOTE: All Windows binaries are compiled for x86-64 architectures only.
  Download kanata.exe. Optionally, download kanata.kbd. With the two files in the same directory, you can double-click the exe to start kanata. Kanata does not start a background process, so the window needs to stay open after startup. See this discussion for tips to run kanata in the background.
  You need to run kanata.exe via cmd or powershell to use a different configuration file:
  kanata.exe --cfg <cfg_file>
  NOTE: The kanata_winIOv2.exe variant contains an experimental breaking change that fixes an issue where the Windows LLHOOK+SendInput version of kanata does not handle defsrc consistently compared to other versions and other operating systems. This variant will be of interest to you for any of the following reasons:
  - you are a new user
  - you are a cross-platform user
  - you use multiple language layouts within Windows and want kanata to handle the key positions consistently
  This variant contains the same output change as in the scancode variant below, and also changes the input to also operate on scancodes.
  NOTE: The kanata_legacy_output.exe variant has the same input defsrc handling as the standard kanata.exe file. It uses the same output mechanism as the standard kanata.exe variant in version 1.6.1 and earlier. In other words the formerly experimental_scancode variant is now the default binary. The non-legacy variants contain changes for an issue; the fix is omitted from this legacy variant. The legacy variant is included in case issues are found with the new output mechanism.
  Linux
  Instructions
  NOTE: All Linux binaries are compiled for x86 architectures only.
  Download kanata.
  Run it in a terminal and point it to a valid configuration file. Kanata does not start a background process, so the window needs to stay open after startup. See this discussion for how to set up kanata with systemd.
  chmod +x kanata   # may be downloaded without executable permissions
  sudo ./kanata --cfg <cfg_file>`
  To avoid requiring sudo, follow the instructions here.
  macOS
  Instructions
  WARNING: feature support on macOS is limited.
  Instructions for macOS 11 and newer
  Please read through this issue comment:
  #1264 (comment)
  Also have a read through this discussion:
  #1537
  Old instructions for macOS 11 and newer
  Click to expand First install Karabiner driver for macOS 11 and newer:
  - Install the V5 Karabiner VirtualHiDDevice Driver.
  To activate it:
  sudo /Applications/.Karabiner-VirtualHIDDevice-Manager.app/Contents/MacOS/Karabiner-VirtualHIDDevice-Manager activate
  Then you need to run the daemon. You should run this in the background somehow or leave the terminal window where you run this command open.
  sudo '/Library/Application Support/org.pqrs/Karabiner-DriverKit-VirtualHIDDevice/Applications/Karabiner-VirtualHIDDevice-Daemon.app/Contents/MacOS/Karabiner-VirtualHIDDevice-Daemon'
  Install Karabiner driver for macOS 10 and older:
  - Install the Karabiner kernel extension.
  After installing the appropriate driver for your OS (both macOS <=10 and >=11)
  Download a kanata_macos variant.
  Run it in a terminal and point it to a valid configuration file. Kanata does not start a background process, so the window needs to stay open after startup.
  Example
  chmod +x kanata_macos_arm64   # may be downloaded without executable permissions
  sudo ./kanata_macos_arm64 --cfg <cfg_file>`
  If the above shows Kanata running but keys are not being sent, you may need to add permissions: #1211.
  cmd_allowed variants
  Explanation
  The binaries with the name cmd_allowed are conditionally compiled with the cmd action enabled.
  Using the regular binaries, there is no way to get the cmd action to work. This action is restricted behind conditional compilation because I consider the action to be a security risk that should be explicitly opted into and completely forbidden by default.
  wintercept variants
  Explanation and instructions
  Warning: known issue
  This issue in the Interception driver exists: oblitum/Interception#25. This will affect you if you put your PC to sleep instead of shutting it down, or if you frequently plug/unplug USB devices.
  Description
  These variants use the Interception driver instead of Windows hooks. You will need to install the driver using the release or from the copy in this repo. The benefit of using this driver is that it is a lower-level mechanism than Windows hooks. This means kanata will work in more applications.
  Steps to install the driver
  - extract the .zip
  - run a shell with administrator privilege
  - run the script "command line installer/install-interception.exe"
  - reboot
  Additional installation steps
  The above steps are those recommended by the interception driver author. However, I have found that those steps work inconsistently and sometimes the dll stops being able to be loaded. I think it has something to do with being installed in the privileged location of system32\drivers.
  To help with the dll issue, you can copy the following file in the zip archive to the directory that kanata starts from: Interception\library\x64\interception.dll.
  E.g. if you start kanata from your Documents folder, put the file there:
  C:\Users\my_user\Documents\
      kanata_wintercept.exe
      kanata.kbd
      interception.dll
  kanata_passthru.dll
  Explanation and instructions
  The Windows kanata_passthru.dll file allows using Kanata as a library within AutoHotkey to avoid conflicts between keyboard hooks installed by both. You can channel keyboard input events received by AutoHotkey into Kanata's keyboard engine and get the transformed keyboard output events (per your Kanata config) that AutoHotkey can then send to the OS.
  To make use of this, download kanata_passthru.dll, then the simulated_passthru_ahk folder with a brief example, place the dll there, open kanata_passthru.ahk to read what the example does and then double-click to launch it.
