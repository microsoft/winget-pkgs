ShortDescription: Convert, browse and clear cached images and files.
Description: |-
  Images you see online are never deleted immediately, unless you delete them of course.
  Most desktop apps have a cache directory, not all provide the tools to clear it.
  CacheMonkey not only lets you purge cache files, but browse and filter through them too.
