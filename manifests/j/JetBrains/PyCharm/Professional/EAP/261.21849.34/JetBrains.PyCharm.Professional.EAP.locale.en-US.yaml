ReleaseNotes: |-
  The sixth EAP build for the 2026.1 cycle delivers significant advancements in environment management for remote and WSL workflows, alongside a major architectural shift for the Jupyter debugger.
  Environment Management & uv
  - uv Workspace Refinements: Resolved issues where uv workspace member dependencies were ignored - PY-86568.
  - Project Integrity: Fixed a critical issue where opening projects created in older versions led to project duplication in 2026.1 - PY-87454.
  Jupyter & Debugging Evolution
  - DAP Debugger: The Jupyter debugger has officially moved to the Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP) and is now enabled by default, providing a more modern and stable debugging experience - PY-85606 and PY-87792.
  - Debugger UX: Improved the Jupyter DAP interface by ensuring the stop button is active in the upper panel (PY-87385) and removing excessive STDOUT from run configurations (PY-83875).
  Type System & Code Insight
  - Variance Handling: Enhanced the type engine's precision regarding variance, resolving issues with incorrect invariant variance on subtypes (PY-87831) and ensuring variance for Protocol type parameters is correctly inferred as bivariant (PY-87731).
  - Inference Accuracy: Fixed false positives where the IDE claimed a function doesn't return anything within lambda expressions - PY-87768.
  - Modern Python Refinements: Corrected tuple typing when using dict.values() (PY-64359) and fixed resolution offsets in the pyflyby integration (PY-87791).
