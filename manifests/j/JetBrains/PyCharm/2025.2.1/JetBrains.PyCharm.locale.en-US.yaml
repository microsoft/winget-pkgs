ReleaseNotes: |-
  Release highlights:
  - PyCharm now autodetects Python interpreters installed with pyenv.
  - When you use the Extract Method refactoring, PyCharm will automatically infer and insert parameter type hints.
  - Instead of hard-coding a path, you can now use built-in macros (like $PROJECT_DIR$) to define the working directory in your Python test configurations.
  - During a remote debug session, the IDE will open your local project files instead of a copy of remote sources.
  - PyCharm no longer incorrectly flags code after a finally block as unreachable if the try statement contains a nested if.
  - The original PYTHONPATH entries are now preserved when running configurations with a Docker Compose interpreter.
  - PyCharm no longer reports a false warning when @classmethod is not the last decorator applied.
  - The remote debug server can now be stopped reliably.
  - The debugger no longer gets stuck on Collecting data... when a Mock local variable exists in a frame.
  AI Playground improvements:
  - You can now use models via OpenRouter in AI Playground by adding your own API key, giving you access to more providers.
  - You can now easily create a new playground session with the same model and settings.
  - Model settings have been reorganized for an improved selection and parameter editing experience.
  - Redesigned model filtering makes it easier to choose specific models from each provider.
