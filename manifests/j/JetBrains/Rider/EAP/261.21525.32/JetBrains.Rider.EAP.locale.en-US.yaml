ReleaseNotes: |-
  Rider 2026.1 EAP 5 comes with the following updates:
  Debug Unreal Engine projects on iOS mobile and VR devices
  Following Android debugging for mobile and VR devices introduced in Rider 2025.3, we're now completing the mobile game development picture with iOS support.
  On macOS, you can now debug Unreal Engine games on iOS-based mobile and VR devices directly from Rider. Set breakpoints, inspect variables, step through code, and analyze call stacks – all within the familiar debugger interface.
  Initial Xcode setup for provisioning and signing is still required per Apple's requirements.
  F# support
  Stepping during debugging is now supported for async and task expressions.
