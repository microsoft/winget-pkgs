ReleaseNotes: |-
  Rider 2025.2 EAP 2 build comes with:
  Step filters in C++ debugging
  Rider now supports step filters for C++, helping you skip over library or framework code when stepping into functions during debugging. It reads both default and user-defined .natstepfilter files, which define which functions should be excluded from step-into actions. Rider also recognizes .natjmc files and treats them as step filters. These filters can also be configured manually in Settings/Options | Build, Execution, Deployment | Debugger | Stepping.
  For the full list of changes included in this build, please see our issue tracker.
