  Rider 2024.3 EAP1 Is Here!
  Support for hot reloading C++ with Live++
  We've been working with the folks at Live++ to bring seamless C++ hot reloading support to Rider! There's no new UI, but the user experience should be a lot smoother.
  Other features and improvements
  - Ability to select the Code Cleanup profile for each file and to skip code cleanup from running on a file.
  - New options to adjust C# naming rules more precisely.
  - Built-in live templates to generate UE_LOG and UE_LOGFMT logging statements in Unreal Engine solutions.
  You can find more details about these updates in this blog post.
