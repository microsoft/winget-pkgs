ReleaseNotes: |-
  Rider 2024.1 EAP 8 comes with the following updates:
  Code With Me
  After much anticipation, preliminary Code With Me support has finally been added to Rider! To enable it, go to Tools | Enable Code With Me. Please share your feedback with us by commenting on the corresponding YouTrack issue!
  Blazor support
  You can now generate additional files like .razor.cs, .razor.css, .razor.js on generating a Blazor Component file template.
  Refactorings
  We’ve made several improvements to the Change Signature refactoring. For more details, refer to the ReSharper page.
  Unity support
  We’ve dropped the extended support for Unity versions predating 2019.2. This means Rider no longer offers features related to Unity Editor integration.
  For the full list of changes included in this build, please refer to the issue tracker.
