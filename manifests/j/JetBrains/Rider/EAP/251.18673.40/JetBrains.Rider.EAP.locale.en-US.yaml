ReleaseNotes: |-
  Rider 2025.1 EAP 2 build comes with:
  Easier environment variable configuration with .env files
  Rider 2025.1 EAP 2 simplifies the management of environment variables. Instead of entering variables manually, you can now use .env files directly in your run/debug configurations.
  Look for the folder icon (Browse) next to the Environment Variables field to attach your .env files, and Rider will take care of loading them before launch. You can even use multiple files across different projects to maintain consistent configurations.
  A Load .env option is also available as a pre-launch task to ensure your environment variables are ready when your application starts.
  Faster debugging for C++ projects
  Rider 2025.1 brings faster stepping times to debugging large C++ projects, particularly in Unreal Engine development. Thanks to targeted optimizations in our custom LLDB debugger, delays during step-over and step-into operations have been dramatically reduced. This blog post has all the details.
  Improvements for remote development environments
  This build also brings improvements to workflows in Docker containers and other remote environments. Check out this blog post to learn more.
