ReleaseNotes: |-
  Rider 2025.2 EAP 4 comes with:
  SQL project support via bundled plugin
  Rider now provides support for SQL database projects via a bundled plugin. The plugin works out of the box and delivers a smoother experience for working with SQL database projects. Key capabilities include:
  - Support for Microsoft.Build.Sql SDK-style projects
  - Project templates for creating new SDK-style SQL database projects
  - Schema comparison
  - Project publishing
  - Importing projects from a database
  - Adding database references
  C# support
  C# 14's null-conditional assignments
  Rider now provides initial support for a?.b = c and a?[i] = c syntax from C# 14, allowing you to write safer, more concise conditional assignments without explicit null checks.
  LoggerMessageAttribute refactoring
  When working with Microsoft.Extensions.Logging package, there's now a new context action to convert ILogger method calls into LoggerMessageAttribute-based methods for improved performance.
  Smarter ILogger<T> completion
  Now when you write ILogger<>, Rider will suggest the current type as a context-aware completion inside the angled brackets.
  inside the angled brackets.
