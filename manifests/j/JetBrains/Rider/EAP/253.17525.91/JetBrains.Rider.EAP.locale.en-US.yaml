  The Early Access Program for Rider 2025.3 Is Here!
  This first build brings a variety of updates for Unity, Unreal Engine, Godot, and more.
  Unity
  - Added an IL Viewer for Unity projects.
  Unreal Engine
  - Customizable folders and files in the .uproject project model.
  Godot
  - Added support for typed Dictionary in GDScript.
  - Inconsistent leading whitespace inspection for GDScript files.
  - New project template for developing GDExtensions.
