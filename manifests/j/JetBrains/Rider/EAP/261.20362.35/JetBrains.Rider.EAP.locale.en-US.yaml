ReleaseNotes: |-
  Rider 2026.1. EAP 3 is out with the following changes:
  F# debugging
  - Smart Step Into lets you skip intermediate calls and step directly into the selected function.
  - Function return values are now shown in the Local Values view.
  - Stepping behavior has been reworked to handle curried functions, constructors, and other F#-specific patterns correctly. This also avoids unintended stepping into compiler-generated tuple code, resulting in more predictable debugging.
  C++ debugging
  We continue to improve Rider's expression evaluator used for Unreal Engine debugging. This update includes better handling of runtime evaluation errors [RIDER-134740], implicit array decay in expressions [RIDER-135055], support for string literal operations [RIDER-135267], and new Natvis-based intrinsics such as strstr() and wcsstr()[RIDER-134815].
  See our blog post for details on the broader Unreal Engine debugging improvements.
