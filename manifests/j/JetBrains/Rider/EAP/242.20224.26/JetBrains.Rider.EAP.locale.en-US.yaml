ReleaseNotes: |-
  Rider 2024.2 EAP 7 comes with:
  Semantic highlighting for C#, C++
  We've added support for optional semantic highlighting for C# and C++. This feature is designed to help you distinguish between different parameters and local variables in the code by color. You can enable or disable semantic highlighting in Settings/Preferences| Editor | Color Scheme | Language Defaults | Semantic Highlighting.
  Navigation improvements
  Target framework, project, and shader context selectors have been moved from breadcrumbs to the inspection widget.
  We've also resolved the issue where Navigation bar members took up too much space [RIDER-114327].
  Debugging performance on macOS
  After much investigation and refactoring, we were able to improve the startup time of applications debugged in Rider on macOS by an average of 6 seconds. For more information and to share feedback on your experience, please see this issue.
  Code With Me (CWM)
  We've been working hard to bring you a better version of Code With Me (CWM) in the 2024.2 release of Rider. With the latest set of refinements now completed, we're at the stage where your feedback is crucial and will guide all our further refinement and development efforts.
  This iteration we've made improvements to various aspects of the typing experience when using CWM. Enhancements include better code completion, more seamless code editing, improved syntax highlighting, refined live templates, and a more robust Undo functionality. You can find a more technical status update here.
  Please take the time to test CWM and tell us about your experience.
  Monitoring tool
  The Monitoring tool window now displays information about managed heaps for .NET Framework applications [DPA-1954]. Please note that information about managed heaps and garbage collection in the Monitoring tool is only available with Dynamic Program Analysis (DPA) enabled.
  This build also contains 2 bug-fixes pertaining to Monitoring: DPA-2036, DPA-1952.
  CQRS validation
  Rider now supports Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS). CQRS helps in using different models for updating and reading information, improving code architecture and performance. The support includes inspections to identify CQRS violations, with highlighting and quick fixes available for many issues. You can enable SQRS analysis by looking up "CQRS validation" in Rider's Settings/Preferences.
  For the full list of changes included in this build, please refer to our issue tracker.
