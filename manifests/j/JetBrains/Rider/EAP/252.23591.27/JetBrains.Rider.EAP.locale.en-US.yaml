ReleaseNotes: |-
  Rider 2025.2 EAP 7 comes with:
  Low-level exception suppression for C++ and game development
  You can now suppress low-level exceptions and signals triggered by manual breakpoints like int3 across all platforms. This gives you more control when debugging C++ game projects and lets you skip over certain asserts without constantly resuming execution.
  Read the blog post for all the details.
  For the full list of changes included in this build, please see our issue tracker.
