ReleaseNotes: |-
  Rider 2024.1 EAP 2 comes with the following updates:
  Revamped Terminal
  This build brings an overhauled Terminal that gains both visual and functional enhancements designed to elevate the convenience and simplicity of terminal-based tasks. This update both improves the tool visually and expands its feature set.
  Support for .NET process dumps
  When you're debugging, process dumps are crucial because they allow you to examine the program's state at the time of an error, even if the issue is not easily reproducible. Previously, Rider was only able to process C++ core dumps. Starting with this EAP 2 build, the IDE will also allow you to import dumps for .NET processes. To import a process dump, go to Run | Debug Core Dump or drag and drop the dump file into the editor.
  Improvements to Godot support
  - We've implemented highlighting for major Godot file types (.gd, .tscn, .tres, .godot), and improved highlighting for .gdshader. Click here for more information.
  - The IDE now offers automatic runtime detection for Godot 4, including for launchSettings.json [https://github.com/JetBrains/godot-support/pull/125].
  - There's now a Start Godot Editor button in the main toolbar, similar to the one we have for Unity [https://github.com/JetBrains/godot-support/pull/119].
  Performance and memory profiling
  The built-in dotTrace and dotMemory profilers now support MAUI and .NET macOS applications.
  Supported target frameworks:
  - MAUI Windows: net8.0-windows, net7.0-windows
  - MAUI Mac: net8.0-maccatalyst, net7.0-maccatalyst
  - macOS applications: net8.0-macos, net7.0-macos
  Profiling MAUI applications with Rider on macOS is only possible in Run with Timeline and Attach with Timeline modes. Click here for more information on the profiling modes available.
