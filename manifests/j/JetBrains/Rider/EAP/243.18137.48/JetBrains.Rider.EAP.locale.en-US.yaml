ReleaseNotes: |-
  Rider 2024.3 EAP 3 is out with:
  Windows Forms Designer for .NET projects
  At long last, Windows Forms Designer now works for projects that target .NET 6.0 and up, helping you create, observe, and modify the UI of your Windows Forms applications. You will get pretty much the same experience and functionality as in Windows Forms Designer for the classic .NET Framework.
  As for limitations, please keep in mind that third-party controls and VB.NET Windows Forms applications are not supported.
  The embedded decompiler
  The IL Viewer now provides IL code for assembly manifest files, including:
  - Assembly and module info such as name, custom attributes, etc.
  - Referenced assemblies and modules.
  - Forwarded types.
  - A list of files and resources.
  This IL code is shown when the caret in the text editor is on an assembly or module attribute, or somewhere inside an <AssemblyName>.cs file for external assemblies.
  Docker and Kubernetes
  - Cluster-level Kubernetes log streaming and analysis with pattern matching.
  - Support for network policies in the Kubernetes UI.
  - New Docker Compose build attributes.
  More details can be found on our blog.
  Infrastructure as Code
  - OpenTofu support.
  - Terraform usage indicators.
  - Terraform fmt support.
  More details can be found on our blog.
  For the full list of improvements and fixes included in this build, please refer to our issue tracker.
