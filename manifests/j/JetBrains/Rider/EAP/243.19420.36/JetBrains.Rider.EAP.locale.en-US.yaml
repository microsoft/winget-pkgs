ReleaseNotes: |-
  Rider 2024.3 EAP 4 is out with:
  User experience
  Run widget: Launch multiple configurations simultaneously
  The updated Run widget now allows launching multiple configurations at once by holding Ctrl and clicking the debug icon. It also displays the controls for all running configurations, simplifying management.

  Increased default tab limit
  The default tab limit in the editor has been increased to 30, allowing more tabs to stay open before closing the least recently used ones. You can adjust this in Settings | Editor | General | Editor Tabs.

  Updated UI for the new terminal
  We've updated the new terminal's UI with a more compact design, reducing padding to maximize your screen real estate. The smaller padding saves space, giving you enhanced visibility while working with commands without sacrificing readability.

  Unity
  The solution scope now correctly displays only the files listed in the generated .csproj files. Additionally, the All Places and Non-Solution Items search scopes now function as expected, including files from the Assets, ProjectSettings, UserSettings, and all Unity package directories.
  For the full list of updates, please refer to our issue tracker.
