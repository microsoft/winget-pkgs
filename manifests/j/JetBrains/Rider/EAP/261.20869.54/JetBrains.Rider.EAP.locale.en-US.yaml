ReleaseNotes: |-
  Rider 2026.1 EAP 4 comes with the following updates:
  Support for file-based C# programs
  Rider now supports working with single-file C# programs that can be run using dotnet run file.cs. You can open a standalone .cs file without a .csproj and run it directly from the IDE.
  Rider's editor recognizes file-based programs with top-level statements, #! shebangs, and #: directives, including #:package and #:sdk. Code highlighting, completion, run markers, and debugging are all available, allowing you to create quick scripts, prototypes, and one-off tools written as a single C# file.
  Push-to-Hint in Remote Development
  Push-to-Hint is now available in Remote Development mode.
  You can temporarily reveal inline hints that are normally hidden by activating Push-to-Hint (double-press and hold Ctrl). This shows additional code hints without permanently enabling them. The widget for this feature lets you pin the mode or quickly access related settings.

  At the moment, hints displayed in Push-to-Hint mode are informational only – actions on hints are not yet available in Remote Development.
  Notable fixes
  We've fixed an issue where disabling the Code With Me plugin prevented any run configuration from being launched. [RIDER-135511]
