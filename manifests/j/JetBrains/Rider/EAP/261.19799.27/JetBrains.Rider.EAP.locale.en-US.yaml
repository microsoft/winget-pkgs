ReleaseNotes: |-
  Rider 2026.1 EAP 2 is out with the following changes:
  New design for the Hot Reload function
  The UI shown when source code changes are detected during run and debug sessions has been updated. The previous banner-style prompt has been replaced with a compact floating toolbar in the top-right corner of the editor.
  The toolbar displays a fire icon to prompt applying code changes, which is replaced by a green check indicator after the changes are successfully applied. A kebab menu is also available to configure Hot Reload behavior.
  New C++ folding settings
  In addition to the C++ naming rule improvements introduced in EAP 1, this build introduces new C++ folding settings under Code Folding | C/C++. You can choose to fold template parameters by default, to fold lambdas, and to use space instead of a new line before { in a collapsed state.
  For the full list of changes included in this build, please refer to our issue tracker.
