ReleaseNotes: |-
  Rider 2024.2 EAP 6 is out with:
  Full line code completion for C#
  Rider introduces support for a new type of code completion: gray text single-line suggestions that complete lines based on the context of the current file. These suggestions are powered by language models that run locally without sending any code over the internet. As of EAP 6, full line code completion is only available for C#, with C++, JS/TS, and CSS support to follow shortly.
  Reworked navigation bar
  The navigation bar in Rider has been reimagined. Now, the path from the project root to the file you're working on also features the symbol where the caret is currently positioned. Clicking on any symbol in the chain reveals a popup that displays neighboring symbols in the file. You can navigate to these neighboring symbols directly from the popup with a single click.
  Improvements to debugging C++ projects
  This build introduces a number of fixes and quality-of-life improvements:
  More user-friendly error messages: Previously, debugging optimized code with LLDB in Rider would sometimes result in unclear internal error messages. These have now been replaced with more user-friendly messages, helping you understand issues more easily. (RIDER-67319)
  Evaluation and visualization of partially available variables: Now, even if some variables are not fully accessible, the debugger can still provide useful information about them. (RIDER-94876).
  Improved data breakpoint experience: The handling of data breakpoints in Rider has been significantly improved. Previously, many data breakpoints, especially those involving items generated by the Natvis visualization framework, did not work correctly and failed silently. This meant that users were not informed when a breakpoint did not function. Data breakpoints should now work more reliably, as any item with an address in memory can be added to a data breakpoint. Moreover, when a data breakpoint cannot be added (for instance, if a Natvis item expression lacks an address), Rider will inform the user about the error instead of failing silently. (RIDER-71394, RIDER-113879, RIDER-113875)
  Notable fixes:
  - Correct parsing of the dateTime and Timestamp database columns has been restored. (RIDER-114175)
  - We've introduced the option to disable automatic adding of DDL data sources to the Database tool window to avoid overconsumption of resources and resulting IDE freezes. You can enable and disable the option by going to Settings/Preferences | Build, Execution, Deployment | SQL Projects. (RIDER-92646)
  - VCS color hints in the tool window or popup structure for C++ once again work correctly. (RIDER-112441)
  - Code Vision no longer flickers on startup. (RIDER-106697)
