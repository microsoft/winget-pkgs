ReleaseNotes: |-
  Rider 2025.1 EAP 4 comes with the following updates:
  Game development
  NoesisGUI framework support: We've added support for the NoesisGUI for Unity and Unreal Engine projects, expanding the range of C++ game UI libraries available for game development in Rider.
  We've also resolved an issue where the NoesisGUI preview on Windows would get stuck in an endless loading state. [RIDER-122145]
  Godot improvements: Rider now supports .uid files in Godot 4.4. When files are moved within Rider, the corresponding .uid files are moved together to maintain project integrity.
  C++ native debugger (LLDB) improvements for Windows
  In addition to the performance enhancements we revealed in EAP 2, we've also made improvements to Natvis support, stepping accuracy, and debugging stability for Unreal Engine and other C++ projects on Windows. Here are some highlights:
  - We improved type visualization by adding support for Synthetic items in Natvis, enhancing Unreal Engine debugging. [RIDER-116407]
  - We added support for the NVO format specifier in Natvis. [RIDER-120524]
  - We enabled Natvis intrinsics in expression evaluation, within other Natvis types, and in conditional breakpoints. [RIDER-111190]
  - We added support for char8_t from C++20. [RIDER-120687]
  - We added a link to apply an expression fix with a single click. [RIDER-114653]
  - We implemented support for exclamation syntax (module.dll!expr) in the context operator for expression evaluation and conditional breakpoints. [RIDER-119956]
  - We improved stepping accuracy in debugging. Stop-over no longer falls into inline functions incorrectly, and the Step-in and Step-over actions now stop at the correct lines. [RIDER-119314]
  - We resolved an issue where debugging sessions could crash the target process due to access violations, particularly in optimized Unreal Engine builds. [RIDER-121706]
  .NET debugger fixes
  We've fixed an issue where expressions in the Immediate Window were evaluated twice, ensuring correct debugging behavior. [RIDER-83380]
  Code navigation
  We added support for the Next Highlighted Usage and Previous Highlighted Usage actions to improve code navigation. [RIDER-15896]
  Decompiler improvements
  - Support has been added for the allows ref struct generic anti-constraint from C#13. [DOTP-8182]
  - Support has been added for ref fields and scoped parameter modifiers. [DOTP-8181]
  - Support has been added for file-scoped namespaces. [DOTP-8184]
