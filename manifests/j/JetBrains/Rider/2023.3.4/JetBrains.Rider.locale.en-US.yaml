ReleaseNotes: |-

  - Proper code highlighting has been restored. [RIDER-103999]
  - Rider 2023.3 running on macOS 13.6 or older no longer causes Xamarin.Mac projects to hang, lack logs, or have issues with debugging. [RIDER-104817]
  - The correct code style is applied when pasting code copied from the AI Assistant chat. [RIDER-102425]
  - AI Assistant chat no longer has trouble finding types in F# code. [RIDER-104282]
  - The IDE is able to trigger builds when attempting to run unit tests with uncompilable code. [RIDER-104574]
  - Unit test coverage no longer fails to start due to an invalid symbol ":" in the environment variable, which previously prevented profiling initiation. [RIDER-104491]
