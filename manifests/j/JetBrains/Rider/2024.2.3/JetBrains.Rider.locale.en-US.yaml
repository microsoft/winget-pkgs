ReleaseNotes: |-
  Rider 2024.2.3 is out with the following changes:
  Code coverage
  Reworked continuous testing workflow
  We've reworked the continuous testing workflow to improve usability:
  - Before: Each unit test session could be converted into a continuous testing session, which could lead to confusion when there are multiple sessions running.
  - Now: There is a single, separate continuous testing session. This change makes it easier to manage and understand your testing workflow.
  Continuous testing indicator
  Rider has a new icon/indicator for continuous testing. The icon shows the current testing state, including whether there are any failed tests. In addition, it provides several quick actions: enabling or disabling continuous testing, viewing coverage results, toggling code highlighting, and more.
  Adjustable code coverage highlighting colors
  Now, you can adjust the colors used to highlight code coverage in the editor. The colors are applied to coverage markers in the gutter, line background, and coverage progress bar, and can be configured individually.
  Notable bug fixes
  - Rider now renders the href attribute correctly in XML documentation for a wider range of tags, namely <see> and <seealso>. [RSRP-440682]
  - We've resolved an issue where running an instance of JetBrains Rider for Unreal Engine game development was causing hitches for other applications. [RIDER-116060]
  - Explicit tests are no longer executed when Rider is running all tests. [RSRP-498451]
  - We've restored the ability of Rider's debugger to attach to projects with Alpine-based Docker images. [RIDER-115068]
  - Rider is once again able to run an application in a Docker container in debug mode on macOS. [RIDER-115759]
  - We fixed a bug causing unresolved symbols to appear in test descriptions when debugging is stopped from the Debug tool window. [RIDER-112650]
