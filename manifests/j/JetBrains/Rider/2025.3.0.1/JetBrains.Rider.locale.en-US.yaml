ReleaseNotes: |-
  Rider 2025.3.0.1
  This update fixes a critical issue that prevented plugins from being upgraded from previously installed to their latest compatible versions. [IJPL-218019]
  Our sincere apologies for any inconvenience this bug may have caused.
  Additionally, we have fixed several regressions:
  - Addressed the delay in completing both code analysis and solution-wide analysis in some solutions. [RIDER-132309]
  - No more false errors in the code generated by source generators. [RIDER-132269]
  If you are upgrading from Rider 2025.2.X, here are the highlights of the 2025.3 release:
  - Day-one support for the .NET 10 SDK and comprehensive C# 14 support.
  - Noticeably faster startup and performance, with core functionality like code completion, search, and navigation available earlier in the startup process.
  - A refreshed UI, with the new Islands theme set as default.
  - Automatic ASP.NET and database issue detection in the Monitoring tool.
  - Perforce MCP support.
  - Game development updates, including initial Unreal Engine mobile development for Android, Unity code in IL Viewer, and typed Dictionary structures for Godot.
  - Improved support for native/C++ code, including highlighting in inactive preprocessor branches and debugging of constexpr code.
  - A smoother experience when working with OpenTelemetry traces.
