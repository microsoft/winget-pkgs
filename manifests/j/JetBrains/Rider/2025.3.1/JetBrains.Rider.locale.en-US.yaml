ReleaseNotes: |-
  Rider 2025.3.1 is out with the following changes:
  Next edit suggestions (NES)
  Rider 2025.3.1 introduces next edit suggestions, a major new capability from JetBrains AI Assistant. NES analyzes the edits you make and proposes follow-up changes elsewhere in the file to help keep your code consistent as you work. Suggestions appear inline as you type, much like code completion, and are highlighted in light purple. When updates involve other parts of the file, Rider prompts you to review and apply them.
  Data sharing for better AI in JetBrains IDEs
  This update delivers the refined, optional data-sharing functionality previewed earlier this year. Its purpose is to improve the reliability and quality of AI-powered features by learning from real usage patterns, always under your control.
  - No data is shared unless you explicitly opt in.
  - Organizations manage participation at the admin level.
  - Individual users can adjust their preferences at any time.
  - For non-commercial users, detailed data sharing is enabled by default, but no information is collected until after the in-IDE notice appears.
  This build also delivers important bug fixes and addresses several security vulnerabilities.
  More on these and other changes included in this build in our blog post.
