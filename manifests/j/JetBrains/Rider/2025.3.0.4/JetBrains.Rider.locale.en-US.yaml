ReleaseNotes: |-
  Rider 2025.3.0.4 is out with the following updates:
  JetBrains AI upgrades
  - Native support for Junie and Claude Agent inside the AI Chat window.
  - Transparent AI quota tracking inside the IDE
  - Bring Your Own Key (coming soon)
  Game development
  Rider now provides cloud-powered multi-line code completion for shaders in Unity, Unreal Engine, and Godot projects. For Godot developers, cloud completion suggestions are also available for GDScript files.
  Working with databases
  Rider replaces the term query console with query file – because consoles have essentially always been files, and it's time the UI reflected that. We've also simplified the workflow, making it more discoverable and consistent. You can learn more about the change in this post.
  Learn more about these updates from our blog post.
  This update also brings a number of bug-fixes and stability improvements, including a fix for excessive memory usage when opening large solutions [RIDER-132952]. For the complete list of resolved issues, please refer to our issue tracker.
