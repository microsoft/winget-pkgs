ReleaseNotes: |-
  Rider 2024.2.5 Has Been Released!
  For versions 2024.2 and newer, certain users encountered troublesome behavior in Rider (RIDER-116340) where file analysis would stop, resulting in the loss of syntax and semantic highlightings, navigation, and other smart features. Only restarting Rider or invalidating the cache would occasionally provide a temporary solution. However, we have successfully resolved this critical issue, and updating to the latest build will ultimately restore everything to normal.
  We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused by this issue!
  Here is the list of other notable fixes:
  - The Go to definition action on an external symbol opens the file and scrolls down again to the definition of that symbol (RIDER-115756).
  - The Ctrl+C shortcut to cancel a process works again in the embedded console (RIDER-116718).
  - The Delete and Backspace shortcuts no longer misbehave in the Solution Explorer’s search bar (RIDER-111046).
  - Modifying an sln file no longer causes an internal crash in Rider while in remote development mode (RIDER-116778).
