ReleaseNotes: |-
  Revised windowed/pairwise operations
  - windowed function now has its step parameter defaulting to 1.
  - pairwise function name was too confusing, it was unclear how it paired the elements together. Now it is called zipWithNext, so it is more clear that each element is zipped with the next element in a collection.
  - constants: PI and E;
  - trigonometric: cos, sin, tan and inverse of them: acos, asin, atan, atan2;
  - hyperbolic: cosh, sinh, tahn;
  - exponentation: pow (an extension function), sqrt, hypot, exp, expm1;
  - logarithms: log, log2, log10, ln, ln1p;
  - rounding:
  - ceil, floor, truncate, round (half to even) functions;
  - roundToInt, roundToLong (half to integer) extension functions;
  - sign and absolute value:
  - abs and sign functions;
  - absoluteValue and sign extension properties;
  - withSign extension function;
  - max and min of two values;
  - binary representation:
  - ulp extension property;
