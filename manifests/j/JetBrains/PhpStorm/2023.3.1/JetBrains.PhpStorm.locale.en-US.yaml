ReleaseNotes: |-
  PhpStorm 2023.3.1 is available
  Here are the highlights of this update:
  - Fixed a bug preventing users from logging in to AI Assistant.
  - Provided the opportunity to check the access status for users with corporate IDE licenses from the AI Assistant tool window.
  In the latest 2023.3 release, AI features are turned off by default for corporate IDE licenses. While the plugin is already bundled, we want to let companies make their own decision about whether to use JetBrains AI Assistant or not.
  Enabling AI Assistant for developers with a corporate license might take up to one hour, so we've implemented the ability to refresh the access status from the AI Assistant tool window immediately by clicking the Check access link.
  You can find detailed instructions on how to troubleshoot other common issues here.
