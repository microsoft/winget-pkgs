  ​
  Here’s a quick roundup of the main improvements:
  ​
  Generics for PHP

  We have added preliminary support for generics via the @template annotation. Working with collections is now much simpler, because the suggestions will contain elements of the expected type.

  PHP 8.1 Enums

  PhpStorm now offers support for one of the most anticipated PHP features, enums, which will be added in the next language update. This means you can already start preparing your code.

  Array shapes

  Annotate your code with one-line array shapes where you expect small object-like structures: array{key: type, key: type, ...}. PhpStorm provides code completion for such annotated arrays and saves you from introducing mistakes.

  ​
  PhpStorm 2021.2 also makes PHP code formatting better, includes improved Extract Method refactoring, new inspections and quick-fixes, ability to run tests before commit, configure actions on save, and many more.
