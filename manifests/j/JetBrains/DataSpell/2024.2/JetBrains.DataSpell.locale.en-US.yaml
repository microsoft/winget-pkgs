ReleaseNotes: |-
  AI cells
  New AI cells allow you to prompt AI Assistant directly in your Jupyter notebook, providing the AI assistant with the context of your data analysis. Additionally, the lightbulb icon next to AI cells gives suggestions about the next steps in your workflow.
  Improved UX for Jupyter notebooks
  You can now expand and collapse both code and Markdown cells. The Run Cell button is now also located next to each cell. Additionally, cells now display their execution statuses and assigned tags.
  The new UI has been made default for all users
  With DataSpell 2024.2, the new UI is now the default for all users, leaving the classic one available as a plugin.
