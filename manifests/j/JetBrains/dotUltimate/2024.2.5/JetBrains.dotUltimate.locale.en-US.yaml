ReleaseNotes: |-
  ReSharper 2024.2.5 Has Been Released!
  ReSharper
  - If you experienced a hang of Visual Studio on startup when ReSharper AI was installed, it is likely that the problem will go away after installing this build.
  - A suppression by comment for the Possible multiple enumeration inspection works again (RSRP-498212).
  dotMemory
  This release brings a new feature to improve your user experience – Automatic View Selection. If you open an object set that results in a single element (e.g., a number of String objects), dotMemory automatically switches to a more relevant view. Let's look at an example when you open a set of strings:
  - Before: dotMemory opens the String object set in the Types view, displaying only a single String item, which requires manually switching to a different view for further analysis.
  - Now: dotMemory automatically opens the set in the Similar Retention view, and the Types view is disabled.
  Dynamic Program Analysis
  - The Monitoring window in Rider no longer prevents you from starting debugging with the Support for C++ Language plugin disabled (DPA-2258).
  - We brought back showing custom metrics in the Monitoring window (DPA-2284).
  dotTrace
  - The dotTrace command line tool no longer fails to attach to a single-file .NET application on Linux arm64 (DTRC-31181).
