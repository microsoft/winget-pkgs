ReleaseNotes: |-
  ReSharper 2024.3.4
  - We have fixed local privilege escalation in the ETW Host Service (CVE-2025-23385).
  - We've fixed an issue where the foreach statement would fail to compile when iterating over a ref struct in an async method, even though the code compiled successfully using dotnet build.
  - We've resolved a code analysis bug where implicit type arguments involving cast operators caused incorrect errors, even though the code compiled successfully. [RSRP-499411]
  - We've resolved a bug in the testing platform where navigation to the test source did not work correctly for tests created with TUnit. [RSRP-498832]
  - We've fixed an issue in the testing platform where test gutter marks were not displayed near tests, particularly for classes or methods with parameters. [RSRP-498834]
