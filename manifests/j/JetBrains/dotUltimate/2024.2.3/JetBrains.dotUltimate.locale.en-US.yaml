ReleaseNotes: |-
  ReSharper 2024.2.3 is out with the following changes:
  Crucial bug fixes
  - ReSharper now renders the href attribute correctly in XML documentation for a wider range of tags, namely <see> and <seealso>. [RSRP-440682]
  - ReSharper no longer erroneously asks for re-authorization. [RSRP-498536]
  - Explicit tests are no longer executed when ReSharper is running all tests. [RSRP-498451]
  - We fixed a bug causing XUnit v3 tests to fail with an System.ArgumentNullException. [RSRP-498222].
  - Code analysis no longer breaks in C++ files that import complex C++20 modules.[RSCPP-35959]
  - Async method names are once again displayed in the dotTrace Viewer. [DTRC-31183]
  dotCover
  Reworked continuous testing
  We've reworked the continuous testing workflow to improve usability:
  - Before: Each unit test session could be converted into a continuous testing session, which could lead to confusion when there are multiple sessions running.
  - Now: There is a single, separate continuous testing session. This change makes it easier to manage and understand your testing workflow.
  Continuous testing indicator
  ReSharper has a new icon/indicator for continuous testing. The icon shows the current testing state, including whether there are any failed tests. In addition, it provides several quick actions: enabling or disabling continuous testing, viewing coverage results, toggling code highlighting, and more.
