ShortDescription: Install JetBrains Fleet on a remote machine for remote development
Description: You can install JetBrains Fleet on a remote machine for remote development. This addresses the case when you have a powerful box at home or in the office, and you want to use your local workstation as a thin client. This approach allows you to leverage higher compute capacity and avoid running heavy tasks locally.

  Fleet 1.41 Release Notes
  Here are some noteworthy changes:
  - You can now select IntelliJ IDEA Classic, Emacsc, Sublime Text, or Eclipse as your preferred keymap via Settings | General | Keymap.
  - Fleet now supports unlimited splits for the main panel, allowing you to customize your editor with more than two vertical or horizontal splits. Just right-click the desired tab, go to Layout and select either Split Down or Split Right depending on how you want to split the editor window or side panels. Alternatively, go to View | Layout and choose your split option. You can also use drag and drop the tabs to the preferred position. Note: Side panels can’t be split indefinitely.
  - In conjunction with the new split options, we’ve introduced eight new actions to the Actions menu (⌘⇧K / Ctrl+Shift+K). To adjust the panels according to your preferences, you can now use the actions Move Tab to Left/Right/Bottom/Top and Focus Left/Right/Bottom/Top Split View.
  - Good news for Windows users. You can now conveniently open any file or folder with Fleet using the context menu. Just right-click your file or folder of choice and go to Open with Fleet.
  - In Fleet version 1.41, you will notice improved typing latency and responsiveness of the editor, especially when working with bigger files.
  - We’ve introduced some UI changes and a new startup page design. The connection page is now more organized, and we minimized the side menu. Recent remote connections (up to four) appear in the side menu for quick access. Furthermore, remote machines are now easily distinguishable. The tags’ colors show which remote machine has been used before, and in the side menu, the connection type has been added before the name, e.g. SSH: 192.168.1.1.
  - You can now also connect automatically to an SSH or WSL server on startup.
  - We're introducing a new action to the context menu and the Goto popup: New Terminal with Profile… This opens the Terminal Profile popup. Now, you can select the profile when opening a new terminal. You can also edit the default settings by going to Settings | Terminal | Terminal profiles.
  - We’ve added an Android device manager to Fleet. Android developers can now create, launch, and delete virtual devices on their local machine.
  We've also fixed several bugs:
  - The completion popup appears in the intended place again [FL-29129].
  - Fleet is now compatible with macOS 15.0+ and Xcode 15.5+ [FL-29895].
  - The quick documentation popup no longer disappears during typing [FL-27803].
  - The welcome screen is no longer shown after closing a workspace on Windows [FL-18096].
