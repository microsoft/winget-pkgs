ShortDescription: Install JetBrains Fleet on a remote machine for remote development
Description: You can install JetBrains Fleet on a remote machine for remote development. This addresses the case when you have a powerful box at home or in the office, and you want to use your local workstation as a thin client.

  Fleet 1.47 Release Notes
  Here are some noteworthy improvements and bug fixes:
  - In this release, we've enhanced code readability and navigation by introducing folding support for multiline comments in Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, Kotlin, C#, C++, Python, Swift, and XML. This feature allows you to collapse and expand lengthy comment blocks.
  - We’ve introduced two new abilities to the AI chat. You can now search for content on the web directly via the chat and retrieve content from links.
  - For improved clarity and usability, we've added a read-only indicator to the clipboard when working with the editor or Git diff tool. This new visual cue helps you quickly identify files that cannot be modified, reducing confusion and preventing accidental edits. Whether comparing changes in your clipboard or reviewing version differences in Git, the read-only status is now clearly displayed.
  - We've introduced a navigation bar to the Text Search preview window that displays the full file path of each file. This enhancement provides better context, allowing you to quickly understand where a file is located within your project.
  We've also fixed several bugs:
  - Deleting files from the Files view on Windows when using the IntelliJ IDEA keymap now works as expected [FL-29860].
  - When using remote workspaces in Fleet, changing general settings now works as expected [FL-31852].
  - When hovering over themes during theme selection, the respective theme is now shown as expected [FL-24198].
  See full release notes for the details about all the changes.
