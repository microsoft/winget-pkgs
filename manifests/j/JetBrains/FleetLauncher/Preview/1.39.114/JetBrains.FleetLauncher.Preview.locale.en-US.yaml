ShortDescription: Install JetBrains Fleet on a remote machine for remote development
Description: You can install JetBrains Fleet on a remote machine for remote development. This addresses the case when you have a powerful box at home or in the office, and you want to use your local workstation as a thin client. This approach allows you to leverage higher compute capacity and avoid running heavy tasks locally.

  Fleet 1.39 Release Notes
  Here are some noteworthy changes:
  - You can now open a file and use Smart Mode without having to open a folder. This feature is currently supported for most languages that use the IntelliJ backend, including but not limited to Java, Kotlin, TypeScript, JavaScript, PHP, Python, and Go. It is also available for C++.
  - In version 1.39, we’ve implemented a file comparison feature. Go to Git | Current File and select Compare with Branch or Compare with Commit to review differences between files and directories.
  - The new Structure tool window offers a dedicated interface for viewing and navigating the structure of a file. To open it, go to View | Symbols or use the Actions shortcut (⇧⌘K / Ctrl+Shift+K) and select Jump to Symbols Tool.
  - We’ve added an inlay hint for generating documentation. Just type /** and press Enter to bring up the Generate Documentation option, and then press ⌥↵ / Alt+Enter to show the tooltip. Inlay hints are currently supported for Java, Kotlin, and JavaScript. This feature will also be made available for PHP, Groovy, and Swift in later versions.
  - Fleet 1.39 offers automatic language detection for untitled files. Just add your code to a scratch file, and Fleet will detect the language you are coding in. Untitled files won’t automatically be saved.
  - We’ve added highlighting to the gray-text code completion. This feature can be enabled or disabled by going to Settings | Code and toggling Enable AI code completion and Enable syntax highlighting in AI code completion.
  - Fleet 1.39 offers faster, more accurate code completion suggestions for Kotlin, Python, and Java.
  - You can now pipe standard output (stdout) into Fleet by using the | fleet - syntax. Fleet will then open a new scratch file with an automatically generated file name.
  - In the terminal, you can now use Fleet by calling fleet --wait, which keeps the command line active until the edited file is closed. It also returns a non-zero exit code if file opening or editing fails.
  - We’ve added two ways of specifying a file with environment variables. Each config in run.json can now specify the environmentFile. Furthermore, on each settings level, it's possible to specify the run.environmentFile. If such file is given, the variables are loaded from it and passed to the run config(s).
  - Beginning with version 1.38.89, Fleet supports custom theme plugins. Now you can control the appearance of built-in UI elements and publish your own theme plugins to JetBrains Marketplace. The customization options include the ability to change the colors of UI controls and provide custom editor schemes.
  - With Fleet 1.39, config files and themes are no longer stored in the home directory.
  - The plugin documentation has received a major update, including a detailed tutorial about building a theme plugin in Fleet﻿.
  - You can now open files directly in other applications. Just right-click on the file and click on Open in.
  We've also fixed several bugs:
  - Images are now shown in their original size in the editor [FL-11201].
  - Clicking Configure Docker now navigates you to the Docker section in the settings when a workspace settings tab is open [FL-19807].
  - The value of the counter in the Search tab no longer changes after you click on a file [FL-25443].
