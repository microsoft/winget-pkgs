ShortDescription: Install JetBrains Fleet on a remote machine for remote development
Description: You can install JetBrains Fleet on a remote machine for remote development. This addresses the case when you have a powerful box at home or in the office, and you want to use your local workstation as a thin client. This approach allows you to leverage higher compute capacity and avoid running heavy tasks locally.

  Fleet 1.35 Release Notes
  Here are some noteworthy changes:
  - Fleet already supported AI-powered single-line code completion for Python, Kotlin, and Terraform. Starting with Fleet 1.35, multi-line code completion for Python and Kotlin is now supported as well.
  - Good news for users of ARM-powered Windows PCs: Fleet goes native for Windows on ARM. Now, Fleet users will experience a massive improvement in performance, responsiveness, and battery consumption.
  - We’ve improved the UI for fixing merge conflicts by introducing a three-window editor. This allows the user to view both versions and the results, which is particularly useful when dealing with more complicated merges.
  - Wildcards can be used to hide files or folders from your file tree. Fleet 1.35 introduces the option to use wildcards when creating exclusions. Just go to settings.json and start adding your wildcards of choice to ”files.excluded”.
  - We introduced a new shortcut to conveniently open recent workspaces. Use ⌃W on Mac or Ctrl+ALt+W on Windows to open a list of your recently opened workspaces.
  - You can now drag and drop files from Files to the Terminal and the absolute path will be displayed there.
  - If you’re working with Go, you’ll notice that we’ve improved the handling of go.mod and go.sum files. Until 1.35, when interacting with the go.mod file, the go.sum file got updated and generated many unnecessary entries. This issue no longer occurs.
  - Fleet 1.35 introduces some UI improvements when working with directories. Expanding or removing a large folder will display the progress of the action. If a directory can’t be listed, e.g. because of missing read permissions, a tooltip with more details will be shown on hover.
  - The Compose preview didn't load on Windows. This issue has been resolved.
  - Since Fleet 1.33, you can use an action that closes all tabs except unsaved ones. There was an issue with Markdown and SVG files, which has been fixed, and those files now behave as expected.
  - We also have great news for Android users. With 1.35, we made several significant changes to Logcat. We’ve not only fixed several bugs, but you will also notice a different look and feel and improved performance.
  - Add "ai.documentationSources": "fleet_kotlin", to your settings, and your Kotlin-related questions will be answered accurately by the AI Assistant.
  We've also fixed a number of bugs:
  - You can search in read-only and library files.
  - Navigation from Diff view no longer goes to a read-only file.
  - Fleet no longer requests a passphrase when Keychain is being used.
  - A new line in the Text Search no longer adds a large space in results preview.
