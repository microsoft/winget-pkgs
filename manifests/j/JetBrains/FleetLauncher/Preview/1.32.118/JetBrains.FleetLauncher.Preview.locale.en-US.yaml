ShortDescription: Install JetBrains Fleet on a remote machine for remote development
Description: You can install JetBrains Fleet on a remote machine for remote development. This addresses the case when you have a powerful box at home or in the office, and you want to use your local workstation as a thin client. This approach allows you to leverage higher compute capacity and avoid running heavy tasks locally.

  Fleet 1.32 Release Notes
  Here are some noteworthy changes:
  - Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP, Dockerfile, and Bash files can now be run without a project.
  - The new Run Current File functionality makes it easy to run and debug scripts in certain languages.
  - Fleet 1.32 comes with the ability to change line endings.
  - You can now quickly sort lines alphabetically in Fleet.
  - Fleet 1.32 reduces the double shift delay, meaning you’ll no longer open the Search Everywhere interface accidentally when using the IntelliJ Platform keymap.
  - It is now easier to find the Replace feature after opening the Find window. A Toggle replace tooltip appears when hovering over the arrow on the left-hand side of the search bar.
  We've also fixed a number of bugs:
  - Collapsed tabs are no longer broken.
  - Close other tabs works as expected and closes all other tabs.
  - The workspaces menu is a more manageable size.
  - Add Caret Above/Below properly ignores automatic line breaks.
  See full release notes for the details about all the changes.
