  Fleet 1.43 Release Notes
  Here are some noteworthy improvements and bug fixes:
  - In version 1.43, we’ve added more branch actions to the Branches menu. You can now click on the three dots menu to choose from different actions. HEAD now has the options Push, Pull, Pull & Push, and Fetch. For remote branches, you can use New Branch from [name_of_your_branch], Compare with Current Branch, and Show Diff with Working Tree. For local branches, push and delete are additionally available.
  - We’ve introduced multiple improvements to the AI chat. You can now use slash commands in the AI chat. For example, you can now type /chat_new to open a new AI tab, /chat_stop to stop generation, or /chat_regenerate to delete the latest response and generate it again. You can also type /docs to query Fleet and other JetBrains documentation directly. You can disable the commands with the settings.json flag `ai.chat.commands.enabled=false`.
  - You can now run Git commands in natural language in the AI chat. You can disable the commands with the settings.json flag `ai.chat.git.enabled=false`.
  - Even with Smart Mode disabled, you can now search and attach symbols using the AI chat.
  - Fleet 1.43 enables LLMs to generate answers to user questions based on retrieved context. Here are some examples: Request information about recent files you've viewed, ask to see the full content of the file you currently have open, request retrieval of the code currently visible to you, ask for local changes to see uncommitted changes in the filetree, ask the AI chat to find information in READMEs, or check recently changed files in the ten latest commits.
  - macOS users can now download Fleet directly without using the Toolbox App. You can choose between separate disk images for Intel and Apple Silicon processors.
  - We’ve introduced a new icon for untracked files. While added files are marked with a green plus sign, untracked files will be shown with a green question mark in the Git window.
  - The font size of the color preview now matches the font size of the editor.
  - We’ve improved the Variable View when debugging Kotlin/Wasm in Fleet by introducing the JavaScriptDebugAware interface. The Variable View can now be customized to present Wasm values, making it more developer-friendly.
  We've also fixed several bugs:
  - Stopping a debugging session in the Debug window will now also stop the process in the console [FL-13660].
  - Text is now correctly aligned when adding a new watch to the debugger [FL-29480].
  - When a breakpoint is hit during debugging, Fleet highlights the line and shows variables as intended [FL-26351].
  - [macOS] You can now use shortcuts with ⌘ to search within the Keymap [FL-29808].
