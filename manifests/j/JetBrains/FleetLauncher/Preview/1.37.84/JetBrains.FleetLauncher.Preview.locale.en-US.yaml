Description: You can install JetBrains Fleet on a remote machine for remote development. This addresses the case when you have a powerful box at home or in the office, and you want to use your local workstation as a thin client.

  Fleet 1.37 Release Notes
  Here are some noteworthy changes:
  - We’re excited to introduce AI code completion for Java! Fleet already supported AI-powered multi-line code completion for Python, Kotlin, and Terraform. Starting with Fleet 1.37, multi-line code completion for Java is now supported as well.
  - In this update, AI Assistant has received another improvement. We’ve added the ability to create files from code snippets that have been generated in the AI chat.
  - Imports are now folded automatically for Java, Kotlin, and Go. This feature will soon also be made available for Python in later versions.
  - If you want a quick documentation popup to be displayed alongside the completion popup, just press ⇧⌘I / Ctrl+Shift+I to enable/disable this functionality.
  - Soft wraps are now enabled by default for Markdown and Asciidoc files in Fleet. You can go to View | Disable Soft Wraps in Current Editor to change the setting.
  - It can be helpful to open multiple Logcat tabs. With Fleet 1.37, you can now open a new Logcat tab using the Tools popup or by selecting New Logcat Tool in the Actions popup. You can also select Jump to Logcat Tool which will open the first Logcat tab that has been opened via Tools. Additionally, using the link in the Run dialog will open a new tab if the link hasn’t been used before.
  - Now an error message will be shown when a file can’t be opened.
  - We’ve also made multiple improvements to our Compose Multiplatform preview functionality. Previews are now available for Kotlin Multiplatform projects with more than one module. The preview feature is also supported for Gradle modules on the second hierarchy level or lower. Additionally, previews are also now available when working with resources in Compose Multiplatform.
  - Swift 5.10 allows the creation of nested protocols within non-generic contexts. With Fleet 1.37, the use of protocols nested inside non-generic contexts is now supported.
  - Starting with Fleet 1.37, you can now open a context menu by right-clicking to Close Git Blame or Show Diff.
  We've also fixed a number of bugs:
  - Commits are no longer shown after being synced successfully [FL-26674].
  - The cursor now returns to the prompt line after scrolling up in the terminal [FL-23536].
  - Font rendering has been improved [FL-22378].
  - Files opened via the terminal no longer open in a new Fleet window [FL-14039].
