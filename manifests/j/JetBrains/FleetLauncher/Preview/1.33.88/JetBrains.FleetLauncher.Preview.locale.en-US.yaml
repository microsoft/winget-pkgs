ShortDescription: Install JetBrains Fleet on a remote machine for remote development
Description: You can install JetBrains Fleet on a remote machine for remote development. This addresses the case when you have a powerful box at home or in the office, and you want to use your local workstation as a thin client. This approach allows you to leverage higher compute capacity and avoid running heavy tasks locally.

  Fleet 1.33 Release Notes
  Here are some noteworthy changes:
  - Fleet 1.33 brings debugging support for Chrome. This feature includes two items:
  - Attach to process now lists Chrome instances running in debug mode.
  - A new Browser run configuration allows you to run a browser with a specified URL and also provides a Debug option.
  - We've improved the highlighting of log files. Log levels are now colorized.
  - We’ve created a user-friendly shortcuts overview, available as a free PDF download.
  - The Previous and Next tab actions are now more discoverable. We added these actions to the GoTo menu.
  - EAP builds of the Toolbox App are now available for your Linux ARM64 systems. The Toolbox App makes it easier to install, automatically update, and roll back Fleet and other JetBrains tools.
  - Fleet 1.33 introduces an action that closes all tabs except unsaved ones.
  We've also fixed a number of bugs:
  - Now, ESLint and Stylint replace the default formatter.
  - Syntax highlighting no longer breaks in TextMate supported files when adding a new line.
  - F# files now have syntax highlighting.
  - Copy-pasting no longer breaks indentation of nested lists.
  See full release notes for the details about all the changes.
