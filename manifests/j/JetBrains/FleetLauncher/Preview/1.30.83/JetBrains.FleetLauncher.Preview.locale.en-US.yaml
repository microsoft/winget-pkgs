ShortDescription: Install JetBrains Fleet on a remote machine for remote development
Description: You can install JetBrains Fleet on a remote machine for remote development. This addresses the case when you have a powerful box at home or in the office, and you want to use your local workstation as a thin client. This approach allows you to leverage higher compute capacity and avoid running heavy tasks locally.

  Fleet 1.30 Release Notes
  Here are some noteworthy changes:
  - We’ve added the option to Show Indent Guides in Fleet, which enhances the appearance of code indents, making it easier to scan the code.
  - Mocha is a JavaScript test framework that is especially helpful for executing asynchronous test scenarios. In the newest version, Fleet supports Mocha tests.
  - Now, you can easily create new temporary files by double-clicking the empty tab area, making your workflow more efficient and streamlined.
  - Now, Fleet displays the first fix directly in the inspection popup, and a link to all fixes is shown in a quick fixes popup.
  - We’ve added an Unstage action to the Git tool. When files are already selected, you now have the option to Add or Unstage all files.
  - Escape sequences inside JSON string literals are now highlighted.
  - Fleet 1.30 also brings editor support for the latest features in Amper. The highlight of this release includes support for working with Gradle version catalogs.
  The following bugs have been successfully fixed:
  - Fleet opens itself instead of a workspace.
  - Long quick-fix descriptions are cut, and the full message can't be read.
  - Reformat Code is not available.
  - Show all quick fixes in Problems view.
  See full release notes for the details about all the changes.
