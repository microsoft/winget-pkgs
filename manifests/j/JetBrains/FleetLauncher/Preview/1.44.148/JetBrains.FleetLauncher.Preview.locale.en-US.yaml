ShortDescription: Install JetBrains Fleet on a remote machine for remote development
Description: You can install JetBrains Fleet on a remote machine for remote development. This addresses the case when you have a powerful box at home or in the office, and you want to use your local workstation as a thin client. This approach allows you to leverage higher compute capacity and avoid running heavy tasks locally.

  Fleet 1.44 Release Notes
  Here are some noteworthy improvements and bug fixes:
  - With version 1.44, we’ve enabled a new UI for all Fleet users. It introduces impactful modifications to enhance your user experience, increase workflow organization, and make Fleet easier to navigate.
  - Zig language support for Fleet is here. Fleet 1.44 introduces a frontend implementation for .zig and .zon files. This includes indentation, commenting, typing assistance, highlighting, file templates, and an LSP-based formatter (Zig only). Fleet also supports basic run tasks based on the Zig Build System and the processing of the build output to find Zig file references. Fleet further provides the auto download of ZLS (the LSP implementation for Zig) and launches it for Smart Mode. This enables code completion, better access to docs, navigation to definitions and usages, and more.
  - Fleet now notifies you when opening a Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) project where the Android SDK is needed but not yet installed. Just click the Fix button in the notification to easily install the missing Android SDK.
  - We’ve resolved the issue that prevented some KMP Gradle projects from completing the import process.
  - With Fleet 1.44, smooth caret animation becomes the default. This feature can be configured via Settings | Editor | Caret.
  We've also fixed several bugs:
  - Creating a dev container now works as expected [FL-29032].
  - When using remote workspaces in Fleet, copy-pasting works as expected in the file tree [FL-30260].
  - The documentation popup no longer hides the quick-fix popup [FL-29023].
  See full release notes for the details about all the changes.
