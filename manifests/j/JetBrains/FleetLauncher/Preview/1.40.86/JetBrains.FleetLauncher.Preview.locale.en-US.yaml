ShortDescription: Install JetBrains Fleet on a remote machine for remote development
Description: You can install JetBrains Fleet on a remote machine for remote development. This addresses the case when you have a powerful box at home or in the office, and you want to use your local workstation as a thin client.

  Fleet 1.40 Release Notes
  Here are some noteworthy changes:
  - Fleet 1.40 introduces Compose Preview for Android. You can now leverage powerful preview customization tools from Android Studio in Android sources such as multi-preview, parameter providers, and annotation options.
  - Along with previews for Android code, we’ve also added the option to render Android previews from common code. For projects with both Android and regular JVM targets, there is now a choice of which platform to render against (Android or Desktop).
  - We’ve added inlay hints for generating documentation for PHP and Groovy. Fleet already supported this feature for Java, Kotlin, and JavaScript. Just type /** and press Enter to bring up the Generate Documentation option, and then press ⌥↵ / Alt+Enter to show the tooltip.
  - Fleet 1.40 introduces a new shortcut for the Build & Refresh action when running Android Preview. Use ⌥⇧⌘R on macOS or Ctrl+Shift+F5 on Windows to use the feature.
  - We’re introducing a new action to the context menu and the Goto popup: New Terminal with Profile…. This opens the Terminal Profile popup. Now you can select the profile when opening a new terminal.
  - The Generate Code template is now hidden when the user is logged out.
  - When generating code with AI Assistant, the editor now scrolls along with the generated content.
  We've also fixed several bugs:
  - Undoing the renaming of a file no longer deletes the file [FL-27850].
  - Soft wraps now work correctly in the diff viewer [FL-19723].
  - Gradle run configurations are now executed successfully, even when passing parameters with spaces [FL-28619].
  - The Git Push action is now available after creating a new branch with a new commit [FL-27285].
  - Using Page Up and Page Down quickly now scrolls as expected [FL-23471].
  - Keymap file does not support trailing commas [FL-18020].
  - GotoKeymapItem action doesnt work from welcome screen [FL-28721].
