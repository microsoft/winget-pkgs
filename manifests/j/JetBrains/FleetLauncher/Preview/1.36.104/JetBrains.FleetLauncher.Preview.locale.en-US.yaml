ShortDescription: Install JetBrains Fleet on a remote machine for remote development
Description: You can install JetBrains Fleet on a remote machine for remote development. This addresses the case when you have a powerful box at home or in the office, and you want to use your local workstation as a thin client. This approach allows you to leverage higher compute capacity and avoid running heavy tasks locally.

  Fleet 1.36 Release Notes
  Here are some noteworthy changes:
  - We’ve improved syntax highlighting for PHP, C/C++, and Svelte for enhanced code readability.
  - With Fleet 1.36, syntax highlighting for PHP works, even when Smart Mode is disabled. We’ve also added highlighting for escaping strings, variables, properties, attributes, and more.
  - If you are working with C/C++, you’ll notice that we’ve added highlighting for attributes, too.
  - We’ve also improved syntax highlighting for Svelte elements such as <svelte:head>, <svelte:options>, <svelte:body>, etc.
  - In addition, we’ve made connecting to a remote server via SSH quicker and easier. With Fleet 1.36, the Fleet URL handler will support connecting to SSH directly using URLs of the following format: fleet://fleet.ssh/<hostname>?<query_params>. Now, only the hostname is required. If some parameters are not specified, Fleet will try to use the closest known match from previous connections or otherwise fall back to default values.
  - We’ve also made the setup of remote SSH connections faster, significantly reducing startup times for connections that are already known to hosts.
  - Fleet 1.36 introduces a new shortcut to apply a primary quick-fix. Use ⌥⇧↵ on macOS or Alt+Shift+Enter on Windows to use the feature when in the Problems view.
  - Good news for Android users: We’ve improved the Logcat color scheme.
  - For multiplatform projects, composable calls are now also highlighted in non-Android sources.
  - Override actions now retain the Compose annotation.
  - Extract Method refactorings on composable functions are now context-aware and don't add a composable annotation if this is not required.
  - Saved scratch files are now shown in recent files.
  We've also fixed a number of bugs:
  - When using Alt+Enter, the search field no longer disappears if there’s no match [FL-16899].
  - The terminal now stops after the window is closed [FL-21743].
  - There are no longer indenting issues when pasting Java multiline comments [FL-25998].
  - 127.0.0.1 is no longer shown instead of an actual IP address when connected via SSH [FL-23890].
  We've also fixed a couple of critical bugs in the hotfix update:
  - Crash on attaching file in the AI chat [FL-27101].
  - Unsynced-commit-remains-even-after-syncing-successfully [FL-26774].
  See full release notes for the details about all the changes.
