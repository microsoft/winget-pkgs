ShortDescription: Install JetBrains Fleet on a remote machine for remote development
Description: You can install JetBrains Fleet on a remote machine for remote development. This addresses the case when you have a powerful box at home or in the office, and you want to use your local workstation as a thin client. This approach allows you to leverage higher compute capacity and avoid running heavy tasks locally.
