ReleaseNotes: |-
  CLion 2025.1 is now available and offers a range of new features for CLion Nova, debugging, embedded development, and more.
  Here are the highlights:
  - CLion Nova now provides full code analysis and code assistance functionality for header and source files that are not included in a project.
  - We’ve added basic support for Objective-C in CLion Nova, allowing you to benefit from syntax highlighting, warnings, code completion suggestions, and other Clangd-based features.
  - The CLion debugger now supports Qt renderers, also known as Qt pretty printers and Qt debugging helpers, allowing you to view Qt variables in a human-readable form.
  - The debugger also supports custom LLDBs for macOS and Linux.
  - When debugging STM32 projects, you can now use the ST-LINK debug server template designed specifically for STM32 chips.
  - We’ve reworked the approach to STM32CubeMX project creation, making it more convenient and providing support for more STM32 chips and project types.
  - When working with Zephyr projects, you can now use the west build command options and sysbuild as your primary build system.
  - AI Assistant features are now free in CLion. New features include natural language prompts for C/C++ in the editor.
