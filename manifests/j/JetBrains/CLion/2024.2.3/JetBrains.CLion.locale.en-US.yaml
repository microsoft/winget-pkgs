ReleaseNotes: |-
  The CLion 2024.2.3 bug-fix update is now available.
  The highlights include:
  - Copying in the editor again works as intended when using CLion Nova and developing remotely with the thin client.
  - When enabled in the CMake settings, the Reload CMake project on editing CMakeLists.txt or other CMake configuration files option retains its state after CLion’s main Settings menu is reopened.
  - The debugger now correctly displays elements of std::list when using an ABI predating С++11.
  - If selected in the old terminal settings, the vertical cursor is retained when the Terminal tool window is reopened.
  - The editor pane can again be resized after placing the tab on the left and reloading the IDE.
