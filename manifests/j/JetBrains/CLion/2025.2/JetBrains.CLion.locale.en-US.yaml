ReleaseNotes: |-
  CLion 2025.2 is now available and offers a range of new features for CLion Nova, embedded development, and more. Here are the highlights:
  - We’ve significantly reworked the CLion Nova code formatter, the corresponding status bar widget, and the widget and settings UI. As a result, the relationship between the editor’s indent size, the status bar widget’s information, and the formatter settings is now clear and consistent.
  - We’ve improved CLion Nova’s performance and responsiveness when working remotely by moving the typing assistant from the server to the thin client.
  - The debugger’s live watches feature allows you to monitor global variables in real time without stopping the program’s execution. This is especially useful for embedded system developers working with time-critical protocols or physical processes requiring uninterrupted operation.
  - You can now use a debug server specifically designed for ESP-IDF projects. It contains only the most basic and essential settings, and everything else is preconfigured to simplify the configuration process.
