ReleaseNotes: |-
  The CLion 2025.2.1 bug-fix update is ready to download!
  Here are some of the highlights:
  - We’ve added support for the special .RECIPEPREFIX variable in Makefile. This allows you to customize prefixes for your recipe lines and ensures syntax highlighting no longer breaks when a recipe prefix character is changed.
  - Code completion now works as expected when you have the same file opened in multiple editor tabs.
  - We’ve resolved several issues with IAR toolchain support, so headers are now properly detected and header search paths align with compiler options.
  - Navigation to derived classes from a base class via the blue target icon in the gutter or the Go To action again works as expected.
  Please share your feedback and report any issues to our issue tracker.
