ReleaseNotes: |-
  CLion 2025.3 is now available, offering faster performance, deeper insight into compile-time evaluations, expanded debugger options, a new default look, and more. Here are the highlights:
  - You can now write code faster and work more efficiently thanks to our new C and C++ language engine, CLion Nova, which we’ve made the default in this release. With this engine enabled, the IDE is up to four times faster at code highlighting, error detection, code completion, and refactoring compared to the legacy CLion Classic engine.
  - The Constexpr Debugger is a one-of-a-kind tool that provides insights into compile-time evaluations, particularly for constexpr and consteval code – something that no other IDE currently offers.
  - CLion now supports the Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP), bringing the IDE closer to being debugger-agnostic. With DAP technology, CLion can communicate with a range of additional debuggers. Besides the bundled LLDB and GDB, you can now use third-party implementations that support this protocol.
  - The Islands theme is now the default look in CLion. Designed to help you stay focused and code with ease, it features instantly recognizable tabs, enhanced in-editor contrast, distinct separation between work areas, and rounded corners.
  - We’ve improved the user experience for embedded system developers who work with the Serial Port Monitor, PlatformIO, and Rust plugins. These plugins are now integrated into the IDE, so you no longer need to install them manually.
  - CLion now supports the Visual Studio 2026 toolchain for Windows – giving you access to the new MSVC build tools v14.50, including v19.50 of the C++ compiler.
  - We’ve streamlined the project configuration process for developers working with the nRF Connect SDK. Now, CLion accepts sysbuild as the default build configuration for these projects, allowing you to build, run, and debug them without needing to configure additional West settings.
  - With the CLion Nova engine, you can now explore and adopt C++26 features like pack indexing, expansion statements, and contracts, plus get clearer diagnostics when constexpr evaluations fail.
  - You can now choose the right AI agent for each task, Junie or Clause Agent, connect your own API keys and models, and get full transparency into your usage and costs.
