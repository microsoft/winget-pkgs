ReleaseNotes: |-
  CLion 2025.1.1 is now available, bringing a new free license and several important improvements.
  Here are the highlights:
  - CLion is now free for non-commercial use, making the IDE more accessible to students, hobbyists, and open-source contributors.
  - We’ve added support for a remote Docker toolchain, which allows you to work with remote containers via an SSH connection.
  - Qt renderers are now bundled and enabled by default, so you don’t have to do any extra work to configure them.
  - The Resync with Remote Hosts option now works again on macOS 15.4 and later.
  - CLion’s Zephyr West integration now supports the use of the nRF SDK with the Remote Host toolchain.
  - The environment variables in the CMake run configuration are no longer overridden by CMake preset variables after a project reload.
  - CLion now provides code insights for Yocto projects that use the Meson build system.
  - Auto-inserting paired {} brackets in CLion Nova now also works when { is already present and you press Enter.
