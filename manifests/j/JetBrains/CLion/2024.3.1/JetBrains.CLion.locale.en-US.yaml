ReleaseNotes: |-
  The CLion 2024.3.1 bug-fix update is ready to download!
  Here are some of the highlights:
  - Dragging a file or directory to another directory no longer causes deadlocks.
  - Double-clicking a symbol to select it now works as intended in remote development mode.
  - A compound run/debug configuration now runs all of its sub-configurations, not just one.
  - Debugging works again on Windows 10, version 1809.
  - CMake-related actions, such as Reset Cache and Reload Project, are searchable again via the Find Action dialog.
  - JSON Schema validation is now aware of YAML tags, such as !reference in .gitlab-ci.yml files.
  - In remote development mode, the diff viewer now opens as you’ve configured it in Advanced Settings, either as a separate dialog or as a tab in the editor.
  For the complete list of bug fixes, check out the release notes.
