ReleaseNotes: |-
  CLion 2024.3 is now available and offers a range of new features for CLion Nova, embedded development, and debugging.
  The highlights include:
  - The IDE frontend and backend improvements have significantly reduced CLion Nova’s memory footprint, which is particularly evident when handling large projects like Chromium ones.
  - CLion Nova now includes function call hierarchy support.
  - The Debug Servers configuration option helps you streamline the process of configuring debugging for embedded and remote development.
  - With the OpenCV image viewer, you can now view a two-dimensional OpenCV array as an image while debugging.
  - You can now attach the debugger to an unstarted process, which is helpful when you need to debug an executable launched by a third-party program or a script.
  - The enhanced JetBrains AI Assistant plugin, featuring our internally trained LLM for C++, has significantly improved the speed and intelligence of CLion’s cloud code completion.
  - Project status notifications have been moved from the editor to the new project status widget and are now less distracting.
  - We’ve improved the onboarding tips so that you can try out some of CLion’s key features and get a clearer picture of its capabilities right from the start.
  - The following bundles have been updated: GDB to 15.2, LLDB to 19.1.3, CMake to 3.30.5, and Ninja to 1.12.1.
