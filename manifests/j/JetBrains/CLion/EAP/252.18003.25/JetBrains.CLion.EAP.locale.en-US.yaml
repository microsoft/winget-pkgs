ReleaseNotes: |-
  A new EAP build for CLion 2025.2 is now available. It includes the following major updates:
  - The new live watches feature allows you to monitor global variables in real time without stopping the debugger or the program’s execution.
  - We’ve updated the bundled CMake version to v4.0.2, which removed compatibility with versions older than 3.5.
  - CLion Nova no longer spawns multiple clangd processes, which caused unpredictable resource consumption.
  CLion Nova now also supports more C++26 features:
  - The delete(“reason”) feature, which allows you to specify a compiler-displayed reason for deleting a function or constructor. This adds more clarity for code maintainers.
  - The _ placeholder, which is useful when naming entities for which a name would not provide any valuable information. For example, you can now use std::lock_guard _(mutex); instead of std::lock_guard random_name(mutex);.
  - The ability to specify attributes for individual structured bindings, like auto [a, b [[maybe_unused]], c] = f();.
  Read our blog post to learn more about live watches.
