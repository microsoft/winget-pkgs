ReleaseNotes: |-
  A new EAP build for CLion 2025.3 is now available. The key updates include:
  - Support for the Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP), bringing CLion closer to becoming a debugger-agnostic IDE. You can provide a path to your debugger with DAP support in Settings | Build, Execution, Deployment | Debugger | DAP Debuggers.
  - Support for the Visual Studio 2026 Insiders toolchain for Windows. This early-access version of Visual Studio 2026 provides the new MSVC build tools v14.50, including v19.50 of the C++ compiler. This compiler version supports new language features in C++23, including the auto(x) and auto{x} syntax that allows you to create a decayed prvalue or, to put it simply, to copy an object to a temporary (P0849R8). The compiler has also received several important bug fixes.
