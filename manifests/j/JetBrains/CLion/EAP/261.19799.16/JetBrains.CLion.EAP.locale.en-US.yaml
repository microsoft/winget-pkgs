ReleaseNotes: |-
  The new EAP build for CLion 2026.1 includes the following major updates:
  - CLion now provides an easy way to set up or fine-tune code insight for all types of projects – including those based on unsupported project formats – and for non-project files, too. To enable this functionality, configure your C/C++ properties in the c_cpp_properties.json file. This feature also simplifies migration from VS Code for users who already work with C/C++ properties.
  - We’ve significantly improved the performance of the LLDB-based custom debugger when using Natvis expressions with the MSVC toolchain. Internal tests have shown debugging speed improvements of more than 80x and a 2.5x reduction in memory usage. This is especially beneficial for those working with large projects that use the Natvis framework extensively. These improvements benefit users of both CLion and Rider, which use this debugger. Learn more in the Rider team’s blog post.
  Please try this build, share your feedback, and report any issues to our issue tracker.
