ReleaseNotes: |-
  CLion 2025.2 Beta is now available with several improvements and bug fixes.
  These major bug fixes are related to CLion Nova:
  - We’ve significantly reworked the C/C++ code formatter’s functionality, the corresponding status bar widget, and the widget and settings UI. The main result of this improvement is that the relationship between the editor’s indent size, the status bar widget’s information, and the formatter settings is now consistent and clear. You can also configure alternative formatters, such as ClangFormat, Indents Detection, or EditorConfig, directly from the widget, without having to do so via the settings.
  - You can now configure patterns for header guard symbols in Settings | Editor | Code Style | C/C++ | Naming Convention. This helps you keep header guard names in the format you prefer. You can also create custom header guard templates.
  - The Go to Declaration or Usages action now also shows declarations, as expected.
  - CLion Nova now integrates support for the CMake import std; module when using a combination of Clang and libc++ on macOS and Linux. Note that there is a macOS bug related to installing Clang with Homebrew. To fix it, use the workaround and also set the absolute path for libc++.modules.json in the cidr.compiler.info.std.modules.json.path registry.
  - CLion Nova no longer mistakenly replaces forward slashes with backslashes when using the Copy/Paste Special | Copy Reference action.
  - The Undo action works again in remote mode.
  Other important updates include the following:
  - We’ve added the ability to select various data formats, such as decimal, hexadecimal, and binary, for live watches. You can also customize the columns in the Live Watches tab by changing their width or order, or by hiding any unused ones.
  - We’ve updated the bundled CMake version to v4.0.2, which removed compatibility with versions older than 3.5. For example, running a project with cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.4) in a CMakeLists.txt file now causes an error. However, you can use the CMAKE_POLICY_VERSION_MINIMUM variable to configure existing projects that are based on unsupported CMake versions (learn more about the variable).
  - While debugging, you can now suppress low-level exceptions triggered by __debugbreak() or inline assembly with int3. This is especially useful when debugging complex game projects because it allows you to skip the game engine’s low-level assertions that trigger manual breakpoints. (Learn more.)
  - We’ve added support for C++26 variadic friend declarations.
