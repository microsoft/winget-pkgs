ReleaseNotes: |-
  The new EAP build for CLion 2026.1 includes the following major updates:
  - In Meson projects, CLion now provides full support for major unit test frameworks – GoogleTest, Catch2, Boost.Test, and doctest. This update is part of our effort to make CLion’s unit test integration independent of the CMake project format.
  - The IDE editor has received visual enhancements, making everyday coding more pleasant. The caret now moves and blinks smoothly, while line selections feature rounded corners for a more modern look.
  There are also some language-related updates:
  - Initial support for C++23 floating-point types: bfloat16_t, float16_t, and float128_t.
  - Support for the C23 _Countof operator.
  - An inspection with a quick-fix for out-of-order C++20 designated initializers.
  - Support for the C23 and C++26 #embed directive.
  Please try this build, share your feedback, and report any issues to our issue tracker.
