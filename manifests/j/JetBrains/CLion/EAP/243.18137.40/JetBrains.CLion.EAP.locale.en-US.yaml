ReleaseNotes: |-
  The third EAP build for CLion 2024.3 is now available.
  Here are some of the key updates:
  - A new tool in the debugger displays two-dimensional OpenCV arrays as images in a separate dialog and offers various editing options.
  - You can now attach the debugger to an unstarted local process, which will automatically trigger debugging when the process starts.
  - We’ve added support for a variety of type trait primitives, which also fixes some false positives for the latest versions of libc++.
  - Memory use by projects running with compilation databases has been significantly reduced.
  - GDB has been updated to 15, and LLDB has been updated to 19.
  Please share your feedback and report any issues to our issue tracker.
