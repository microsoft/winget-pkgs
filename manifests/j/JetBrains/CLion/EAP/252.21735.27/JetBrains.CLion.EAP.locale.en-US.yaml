ReleaseNotes: |-
  A new 2025.2 EAP build is now available. It includes the following major updates related to CLion Nova:
  - When working in remote mode, the typing assistant now runs on the thin client instead of the server. This means your internet connection no longer affects the IDE’s responsiveness. Features like auto-inserting pair parentheses or smart indentation when pressing Backspace are now as fast as in local mode.
  - CLion Nova now correctly imports #defines from a header unit, which is transitively imported through a named module and directly imported at the same time.
  - The false Zero constant can be replaced with nullptr warning no longer appears when a literal 0 is compared with an expression of a standard comparison category type.
  Please share your feedback and report any issues to our issue tracker.
