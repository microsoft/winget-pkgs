ReleaseNotes: |-
  GoLand 2025.2 EAP 4 is now available!
  This build brings the next improvement in our ongoing effort to make it easier to identify potential nil dereference issues.
  - GO-18705: when you use the Explain potential nil dereference quick-fix, GoLand now opens the Problems tool window with a new Go DFA tab. This tab shows the full path that leads to the potential dereference.
    The new view highlights where the nil value comes from and how it moves through the code until it is used.
  This release also includes several minor updates and bug fixes. For the full list of improvements, see the release notes.
