ReleaseNotes: |-
  GoLand 2025.2.1.1 is now available!
  This minor update includes a small but important addition — the Go Developer Survey.
  The Go team wants to hear about your experience working with Go. Your feedback will help improve existing tools and guide the development of new features, all with the goal of creating a better experience for Go developers.
  The survey prompt will appear in the IDE during your workflow. Once the survey is closed, the Go team will share de-identified and aggregated results with the community.
  Thank you for helping make the Go ecosystem better!
  For a complete rundown of the new features, visit our What's New page.
