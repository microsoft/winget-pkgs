  What's New in Toolbox App 3.3
  jetbrainsd service
  Toolbox App 3.3 ships with the jetbrainsd service – a lightweight background process that starts automatically alongside the Toolbox App and JetBrains IDEs. It handles jetbrains:// links by intercepting URL requests and forwarding them to the Toolbox App, providing a more reliable experience when opening links from browsers, documentation, or external applications.
  Plugin Updates Without Restart
  Plugins can now be updated without restarting the application, as the Toolbox App will pick up plugin changes automatically. TBX-17078
  Remote Development Fixes
  The Toolbox App remote agent now properly stops when you select Close and Stop and disconnect via SSH, instead of remaining active in the background. TBX-17123
  The app no longer crashes with an RpcClient was cancelled error when navigating to SSH remote development targets after restarting your machine. TBX-16900
  Linux Improvements
  The .desktop file now uses relative icon paths instead of absolute ones, improving compatibility with different Linux setups. TBX-16650
