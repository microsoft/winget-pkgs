ReleaseNotes: |-
  [PostgreSQL] Smart refresh
  DataGrip now supports the smart refresh mechanism for PostgreSQL databases. Previously, the IDE automatically refreshed the whole schema in the database explorer every time a DDL statement was executed. With the smart refresh mechanism implemented, DataGrip analyzes which objects could be potentially modified by the query and refreshes that specific set of objects only.
  This means that if your database contains many objects, you do not have to wait for an extended period while the whole schema is refreshed each time you run a DDL statement. Since only one specific set of objects is synchronized, you can get back to work much more quickly than if every object needed to be refreshed and still have everything you need right in your database explorer.
  [SQLite] WSL database file path
  After much anticipation, DataGrip now supports WSL file paths for SQLite database files. We have implemented a solution to address the write-locking issue in WSL on our side. This means that you can now access your SQLite database under WSL and work with it without the database file being locked for you. To do this, go to the Data Sources and Drivers dialog and use the following file path format: \\wsl$\<os>\home\<username>\<database_file_name>.sqlite. For example, \\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu-24.04\home\alexey\identifier.sqlite.

  [MongoDB] Support for read preference and replica set connectivity settings
  You can now set the way read operations are routed to the members of a MongoDB replica set, and even define which replica set should be used. To do this, while configuring the connection to your MongoDB database, go to More Options and enable the corresponding option in the Data Sources and Drivers dialog. Once you select either of them from the list, a new field appears for you to specify the setting. To specify your desired read preference, select the one you need in the Read preference field. To define your replica set, simply type its name in the Replica set field.

  Floating toolbar
  DataGrip now displays a set of context-based and AI-driven actions available for a piece of code in a floating toolbar. Select any code in your code editor to make the toolbar appear. To customize the floating toolbar, use the kebab menu (three vertical dots). To hide it, you can either use the same menu or go to Settings | Advanced Settings | Editor and check the Hide floating toolbar for code editing option.
