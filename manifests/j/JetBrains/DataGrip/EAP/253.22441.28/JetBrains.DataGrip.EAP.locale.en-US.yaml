  AI Assistant explanation for query plans
  You can ask our AI Assistant to explain your query plans. To do this, right-click your query and go to Explain Plan | Explain Plan or Explain Plan | Explain Analyse. The plan will appear in the Plan tab of the Services tool window. On the left toolbar of the tab, click Analyze SQL Plan with AI (experimental). AI Assistant will then provide an explanation in the chat, where you can ask any additional questions you might have about the plan.
  To use this feature, you need to have the AI Assistant plugin installed in your IDE.

  AI Assistant query optimization
  AI Assistant can now optimize your query for better performance and efficiency. It does this by:
  - Automatically detecting inefficiencies such as redundant JOIN, missing indexes, or suboptimal execution plans.
  - Providing actionable suggestions or automatically rewriting queries to improve performance.
  - Leveraging Explain Plan outputs for deeper analysis and diagnostics.
  You can ask AI Assistant to optimize your query by right-clicking it and selecting AI Actions | Optimize query with AI (experimental). AI Assistant will then give you a list of suggestions in the chat, and you can continue to ask any questions you might have there.

  To use the AI Assistant query optimization feature, you need to have the AI Assistant plugin installed in your IDE. This feature may require you to attach the database schema so that it can suggest proper optimizations.

  Main menu redesign
  We have restructured and improved the main menu by clearing out some of the clutter and keeping only the most useful actions, such as Reformat Code, Recent Changes, Jump to Query File, and Show Query History. Now it is easier to find and invoke the actions you most often need.
