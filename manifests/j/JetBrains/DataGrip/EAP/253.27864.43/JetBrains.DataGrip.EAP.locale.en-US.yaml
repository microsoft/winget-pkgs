ReleaseNotes: |-
  Redesigned folders in Database Explorer
  We have redesigned the folders that are used in Database Explorer. Previously, they were virtual and were not stored anywhere. Since these folders are essentially groups but not directories, their configuration information is now stored in .idea/db-forest-config.xml. You can add this configuration file to the VCS to share it with your colleagues, or you can also ignore it in the VCS. Any folders you may already have will be automatically converted to the new configuration.
  In Database Explorer, you can arrange your folders in any way that works for you, as they are not sorted alphabetically. To do this, use the Move context menu action group or the corresponding shortcuts.

  To create a new folder at the highest level, click New on the toolbar and select Folder. To create a new subfolder, select New | Folder in the relevant folder's context menu. A folder's name is not considered an identifier, so you can have two folders with the same name inside the same folder.
  [Snowflake] Support for classes
  Snowflake database functionality now supports Classes, including the following:
  - Introspection of built-in classes and methods, as well as class instances.
  - Parsing of DDL statements for class instances, related SHOW statements, and the foo!bar() syntax for method calls.
  - Resolution of references to classes, class instances, and methods.
  - Parameter info and signature inspection for method calls.

  [Microsoft SQL Server] Support for VECTOR and JSON data types
  We've also added support for the VECTOR and JSON data types that were introduced to Microsoft SQL Server 2025 earlier this year. These data types are now available in code completion suggestions, where they are highlighted properly, and you can also use them in the Create and Modify dialogs.
