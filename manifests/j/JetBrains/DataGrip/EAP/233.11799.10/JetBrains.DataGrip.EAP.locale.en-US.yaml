ReleaseNotes: |-
  Data visualization
  Since the release of DataGrip 2023.3, it's been possible to visualize data following our integration of the Lets-Plot library, with its basic no-code data visualization possibilities. The visualization is available on all three types of grids:
  - Main tab: When you open the table, view, or CSV file, the plot is displayed in split mode.
  - Result tab: When you observe the result of a query in the Services tool window, the plot can be displayed instead of the grid.
  - In-editor results: It's possible to display the plot instead of the grid.
  Known issue: The settings for the visualization are not saved, which means that if you reopen the grid, the plot will be in its default state.
  You can find more information on data visualizations in our documentation.
  This feature is still under development, and we would like to hear your feedback! You can provide this using the feedback form, by creating an issue in our tracker, or by writing directly to datagrip@jetbrains.com.
  New import functionality
  We have spent a significant amount of time reworking our import functionality, but we believe it was worth it for the following reasons:
  - It was the last chapter in the big transition to our generated Modify Object UI, which is described in detail here.
  - The feature now includes the functionality to import to several targets.
  - It is now possible to edit several things at once. For example, you can change formats or encode for several files, changing the schema for several targets.
  Some features to highlight:
  Mapping
  The default target entity is called mapping. Here, you can define the target table and map the file columns with the columns of the target table. If you need to edit the table itself, press the Edit button:
  The table will appear in the tree UI on the right. This UI completely repeats the Modify Object UI: here you can do any kind of manipulations with the table and its objects.
  Auto-generate table names
  This button automatically generates the table name from the source file. It can be useful if you rename the table and want to revert to its default name.
  Simplify column names
  This action can come in handy when the original column names contain spaces.
  Reverting to the old UI
  We understand that this rework is a huge change that may be inconvenient for some of our users. We would appreciate any feedback you can share with us to help us understand how we can improve the new UI, making it both more powerful and clearer for all use cases.
  If, for any reason, you wish to revert to the old UI, you can use this option:
  This option will be removed only when we have processed all the negative feedback we have received about the new UI.
  DynamoDB support
  We are pleased to announce that the 419 people who voted for that ticket didn't do so in vain. Support for DynamoDB is now coming to JetBrains IDEs!
  What has been implemented:
  - Data can be viewed via DataGrip's data viewer
  - PartiQL for DynamoDB support in the code editor
  - Tables with keys and indexes are now introspected
  If there's anything else that you think needs to be supported as a priority, please comment on this YouTrack issue.
