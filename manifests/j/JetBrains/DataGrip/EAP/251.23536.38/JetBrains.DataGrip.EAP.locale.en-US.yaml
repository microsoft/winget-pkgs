ReleaseNotes: |-
  Support for tilde in path fields
  We have supported the use of the tilde (~) in the path fields for SSL and BigQuery key and certificate files. Now, you can use the character to specify directories in the Data Sources and Drivers dialog. To do that for your SSL connection, open the dialog by pressing Cmd+; (macOS)/Ctrl+;(Windows/Linux), and select the data source you want to change the settings for. Then open the SSH/SSL tab and navigate to the SSL section.

  [PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB] Geo type data display
  For the PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MariaDB spatial databases, DataGrip can now correctly display geo types raw in the grid.
