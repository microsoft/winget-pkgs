ReleaseNotes: |-
  Scripted loaders
  You can now import data from your tabular data files. We've implemented scripted loaders to enable importing for the following file formats: Excel, JSON, Parquet, and Shapefile.
  The loaders are scripted, which means you can write and use your own custom ones. To add custom scripted loaders, place them in their specific directory in Scratches and Consoles | Extensions | Database Tools and SQL | data | loaders.
  To import the data, drag your file from the Files tool window to the schema in the database explorer, and configure the import settings in the Import dialog.

  Additionally, DataGrip can now display the contents of your tabular data files in the data editor. To open the files, simply click them in the Files tool window. To disable the feature, go to Settings | Advanced Settings, find the Open file as table if detected by scripted loader setting, and select None.

  Related Rows in floating toolbar
  Now, you can get to related rows much easier by using the table cell's floating toolbar. Just click the cell and then click the Related Rows (key) icon on the floating popup toolbar.

  To remove this action from the floating toolbar, open the toolbar, click More, and then select Customize This Toolbar. In the Customize Grid Floating Toolbar dialog, select the action, and click Remove. You can restore the action by going to Settings | Appearance & Behavior | Menus and Toolbars, selecting Grid Floating Toolbar, and then clicking Add.
  We have also simplified the flow of this action. Previously, its behavior options would appear in a popup window after selecting an action in a cell's context menu. We have now moved the behavior options to the Related Rows action behavior selector, which you can find under Settings | Advanced Settings. The Navigate And Select First option will select the first referenced rows and show all the rows in the table. The Navigate And Filter All option, on the other hand, will show the referenced rows only.
  AI Assistant features
  Generate code in editor
  Ask AI Assistant to generate SQL code right in the editor. To do so, click the Generate Code with AI button on the editor toolbar and enter your prompt. An example prompt might be: "Add commands that will create a books table and populate it with three sample rows".

  After AI Assistant generates the code, you can accept the generated code, regenerate it, or specify your prompt by clicking the corresponding buttons at the bottom of the suggestion pane. You can also take the generated code to the AI chat to ask AI Assistant any questions you may have about the code.

  Modify tables
  AI Assistant can now help you with modifying tables. In the Modify dialog, click the UI AI Assistant button to invoke the UI AI Assistant dialog. In the dialog, simply ask AI Assistant to do what you need, for example, "Switch all the VARCHAR data types to CHAR". Once AI Assistant generates the requested code, you will be able to view and edit it in the preview pane of the dialog.

  Explain and fix SQL problems using intention actions
  Now, you can use AI Assistant to better understand and fix SQL problems. For any problems with a severity level higher than Weak warning, AI Assistant will suggest an explanation and a fix. To get an explanation, invoke the intention actions by selecting the highlighted code and pressing Alt/Opt+Enter, selecting AI Actions, and then Explain SQL problem under caret. AI Assistant will then provide the explanation in the chat.

  To fix the problem, in the AI Actions popup window, select Fix SQL problem under caret.
  This feature can require attaching the database schema to suggest proper explanations and fixes.
