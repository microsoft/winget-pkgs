ReleaseNotes: |-
  [SQL Server, Oracle] Smart refresh
  DataGrip automatically refreshes the schema in the database explorer every time a DDL statement is executed. This applies when the Auto sync option is turned on in the data source properties.
  This process could take a significant amount of time when the database contains many objects, for example, with Oracle databases, where the system catalogs are very slow.
  Starting from the 2024.2 version, this refresh mechanism is more efficient than before. DataGrip now analyzes which objects could be potentially modified by the query and refreshes that specific set of objects only.
  Important! Although we make every effort to ensure that DataGrip successfully detects modified objects in the majority of cases, if the statement modifies other objects indirectly, DataGrip may miss such modifications. For example, when dropping objects with cascade options or modifying tables used in procedures or functions. In this situation, you can call the Refresh action to make DataGrip perform a complete database refresh.

  Mentioning database schemas in AI Assistant chat
  You can attach your database schema to the AI Assistant chat by mentioning it in your prompt. To do this, enter your prompt using # followed by the database schema name, for example, “Give me the query to get all actor names from #public.”

  AI Assistant will then analyze your schema and generate the query.

  This feature is particularly important for other JetBrains IDEs, as they have no other way of attaching database schemas to the AI chat.
