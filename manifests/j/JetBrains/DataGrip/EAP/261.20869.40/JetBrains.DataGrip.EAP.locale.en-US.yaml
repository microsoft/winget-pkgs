ReleaseNotes: |-
  Data Source and Drivers dialog improvements
  We have made a few changes to the Data Sources and Drivers dialog.

  1. The Data Sources, Clouds, Drivers, and DDL Mappings sections are now the main tabs in the dialog, located on the left-hand side.
  2. If the Comment field is empty, it is hidden by default. To display it, click Add Comment next to the Name field.
  3. For the Driver dropdown, if the selected driver has not been downloaded, DataGrip shows a corresponding comment. To download the driver, click Download near the dropdown.
  4. The Connection type dropdown options are now tabs. If a data source has more than three connection types, they are displayed as a dropdown.
  Also, the Create DDL Mapping action has been removed. You can create a DDL mapping on the DDL Mappings main tab.
  Files are created with the SQL dialect and data source attached
  When chatting with AI Assistant in the AI Chat tool window, you can create a file from a code snippet.

  If there is any context about the SQL dialect, a data source, or a schema provided in the chat, you don’t have to attach any of those or set the dialect because DataGrip will do this automatically. The same goes for questions about a file that already has a data source attached: DataGrip will attach that data source to the newly created file.

  DataGrip will store the created file in the current project directory.
  [Oracle] Intention action for suppressing the resolve inspection for back label references
  We have made the Suppress for back label references option easier to find and use. Previously, it was only available in the Settings dialog under Editor | Inspections | SQL.

  Now, it can be toggled in intention actions. To enable or disable it, open the list of intention actions by clicking Alt+Enter (Windows/Linux) or Option+Enter (macOS), navigate to Enable option “Suppress for back label references”, and select or deselect the Suppress for back label references checkbox.

  Execute Selection as Single Statement action in the context menu
  We have added the Execute Selection as Single Statement action to the context menu of a code selection. Use this when you need to execute a certain chunk of code and DataGrip isn’t parsing it properly.

  Query Files folder in the database explorer
  You can access your query files in the database explorer. We have added a Query Files folder that appears under each data source node. To toggle this folder's visibility, click View Options on the tool window toolbar, and then select or deselect the Query Files option.

  Explain Plan
  We have made a few updates to the Explain Plan workflow to make it more discoverable, informative, and easy to use:
  - The list of options in the Explain Plan dropdown on the code editor toolbar has been shortened. Now it only has Explain Plan and Explain Analyse on it.

  - In the Services tool window, the Query Plan tab that displays the plan has been moved to the same level as the Output and Result tabs. It also has a new icon now.

  - In the Query Plan tab, you can now view details of each plan row in a separate panel on the right-hand side of the tab.

  - For the cells that contain a table name, quick documentation is available in a popup when you hover the cursor over it.

  - The different views available for a query plan are displayed in separate inner tabs. These inner tabs can be seen at the bottom of the Query Plan tab. They are hidden by default and appear only when more than one tab is open. To open the Total Cost or Startup Cost tab, click Flame Graph on the left-hand toolbar and select the view you need.

  - You can now copy the query plan in the database’s native format, for example, JSON or XML. To do this, click the Copy Original Query Plan button at the top of the left toolbar. This is supported for PostgreSQL, Amazon Redshift, MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, and Snowflake.

  [Microsoft SQL Server] Support for JSON indexes
  DataGrip now supports creating and modifying JSON indexes for Microsoft SQL Server. You can work with them in code generation and also use the indexes in the Create and Modify dialogs.

  Show Geo Viewer button on the toolbar
  For better discoverability, we have moved the Show Geo Viewer button to the data editor toolbar.

  Minor improvements
  - In the IDE Settings dialog, under Editor | Code Style | SQL | <code_style>, the Inherit General SQL style checkbox now contains a link to the General SQL style settings page.
  - DBE-14375, DBE-24796: The MATCH_RECOGNIZE expression support has been implemented for Google BigQuery and improved for Snowflake and Oracle.
