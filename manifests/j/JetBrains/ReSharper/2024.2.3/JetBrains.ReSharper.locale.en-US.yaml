ReleaseNotes: |-
  ReSharper 2024.2.3 is out with the following changes:

  Reworked continuous testing
  We've reworked the continuous testing workflow to improve usability:
  - Before: Each unit test session could be converted into a continuous testing session, which could lead to confusion when there are multiple sessions running.
  - Now: There is a single, separate continuous testing session. This change makes it easier to manage and understand your testing workflow.
  Continuous testing indicator
  ReSharper has a new icon/indicator for continuous testing. The icon shows the current testing state, including whether there are any failed tests. In addition, it provides several quick actions: enabling or disabling continuous testing, viewing coverage results, toggling code highlighting, and more.
