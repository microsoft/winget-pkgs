ReleaseNotes: |-
  What's fixed:
  - We've fixed a problem in the Jira integration, so search URLs are generated correctly (IJPL-208931).
  - We've fixed the appearance of the horizontal scrollbar in the Islands Light theme, so the scrollbar is visible in editor components without scrolling (IJPL-209382).
  - We've fixed the appearance of the scrollbar in the What's New with the Islands Light theme used, so the scrollbar looks same as scrollbars in editor tabs (IJPL-210341).
  For more details, please see the release notes.
