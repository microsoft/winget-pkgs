ReleaseNotes: |-
  What's fixed:
  - We've fixed a platform module dependency on the TextMate plugin that was not guaranteed to be bundled with the IDE (IJPL-233564).
  - We've fixed a one minute long freeze that occurred after performing a Git commit and then attempting to generate YAML files in the Terminal (IJPL-231401).
  - We've got rid of constant micro-freezes that were caused by AuthorshipExportCheckinHandlerFactory.AuthorshipExportCheckinHandler (IJPL-233697).
  - We've improved memory handling by clearing CachedValuesManager caches for long-lived UserDataHolders on closing a project (IJPL-232539).
  - We've fixed an issue with the Configure Password dialog warning being erroneously shown even when a KeePass or a Native Keychain was properly configured (IJPL-230777).
  - We've restored the behavior of the Do not save, forget passwords after restart option, so it triggers the Error in DB dialog (IJPL-229386).
