ReleaseNotes: |-
  What's fixed:
  - We've added support for string literals in import and export statements (WEB-72912).

  - We've introduced support for TypeScript auto imports from directories that are referenced in paths (WEB-76366).
  - We've improved the behavior of the JavaScript debugger, so the message dialog is closed on cancelling a coroutine scope (WEB-76592).
  - We've fixed a problem with high CPU usage that was caused by conflicts between the debugger's processes (WEB-76565).

  - We've reworked the workflow for enabling Ultimate plugins in the JetBrains Client (IJPL-197310).
  - We've implemented highlighting for updated bundled plugins in the Settings dialog (IJPL-203048).
  - We've fixed null-safety issues in LSP (IJPL-232799).
  - Non-suspending background write actions can be now run via the standard API of WriteAction.run (IJPL-232712).
  - We've removed the @RequiresBlockingContext annotation from getInstance() of services (IJPL-232642).
  - We've got rid of the In-memory failed rebase notification (IJPL-232589).
  - We've enabled a git.enable.working.trees.feature registry key for Git Worktree support (IJPL-232546).
  - We've dropped ProjectExtension from the workspace model (IJPL-232406).

  - AI Assistant plugins have been migrated to the frontend from Monolith (IJPL-224351).

  - We've added a possibility to navigate through files despite the write action being run in the background (IJPL-219407).
  - We've implemented an interface for running VirtualFilePointerListener in the background (IJPL-197126).
  - Deleting files now moves them to the system trash or recycle bin instead of removing them permanently (IJPL-2151).
  - We've fixed an issue with the microphone not working during a Code With Me session on a MacBook that is connected as a client (IJPL-208983).
  - We've implemented support for starting multiple selected services via run configurations of the type Shell Script (IJPL-230472).
  - We've got rid of extraneous error messages for incompatible plugins when the plugins are disabled (IJPL-232072).
  - We've improved memory handling by clearing CachedValuesManager caches for long-lived UserDataHolders on closing a project (IJPL-232539).
  - We've fixed an issue with search_in_files_by_regex ignoring the specified directory (IJPL-231480).
  - We've added a workaround to prevent Wayland from being enabled for the JetBrains Client (IJPL-231138).
  - We've restored mnemonic shortcuts in the second-level menu in ListPopups, thus improving keyboard navigation (IJPL-201436).
  - We've improved the appearance of the Top Navigation Bar by removing a dark line above it (IJPL-228978).
