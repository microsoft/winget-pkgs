ReleaseNotes: |-
  What's fixed:
  - We've improved the look-and-feel with Code With Me by showing the Select Browser to Debug popup when a browser configuration is not available on the client side (WEB-75160).
  - We've improved the appearance of the Commit tool window, so the counters and labels do not overlap on decreasing the width of the tool window (IJPL-73175).
  - We've introduced a com.intellij.modules.compose plugin alias thus making it possible to provide plugin templates that use Compose for UI (IJPL-213685).
  - We've improved the Markdown support by enabling GitHub alerts (IJPL-213313).
  - We've made the Grazie widget hidden unless it is enabled explicitly (IJPL-213087).
  - We've fixed formatting in Dockerfiles preventing their folded parts from unfolding on reopening a Dockerfile (IJPL-212945).
  - We've improved formatting in the RUN blocks inside Dockerfiles preventing the caret from automatically moving to a wrong position to match expected indent after pressing Tab (IJPL-212914).
  - We've separated the Docker functionality fron the Experimental DevContainers feature when a project is opened via Eel (IJPL-212871).
  - We've added multi-stage line separators in Dockerfiles (IJPL-212721).
  - We've fixed the problem with the whole line being highlighted instead of a lambda expression only when a lambda breakpoint is hit in the Remote Development mode with the split flag enabled (IJPL-212689).
  - We've updated the LanguageTool to version 6.7 (IJPL-212435).
  - We've fixed a problem with the JetBrains Gateway's ramping up CPU after ssh disconnection (IJPL-210626).
  - We've introduced a visibility check for content modules that are used as dependencies (IJPL-209927).
  - We've introduced recognition of file:/path/to/file links for local files (IJPL-201536).
