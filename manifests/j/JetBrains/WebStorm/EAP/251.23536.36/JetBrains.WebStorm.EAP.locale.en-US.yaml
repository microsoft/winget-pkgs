ReleaseNotes: |-
  What's fixed:
  - We've fixed RXJS type inference on using tap() in Angular applications ( WEB-71482).
  - We've improved Angular support getting rid of duplicated Unresolved pipe messages (WEB -71557).
  - We've implemented resolution for the @ViewChild selector inside control flow blocks (WEB-71756).

  - We've extended the context menu of a folder with an option to mark the folder as excluded or non-excluded (WEB-70418).
  - We've added a Dynamic usages filter to the Find tool window and to the popup so text and string usages can be filtered out from the list of search results (WEB-67677).

  - We've revised and reworked DispatcherMain (IJPL-178581, IJPL-175288, IJPL-166436).
  - The REST Client response handler regex no longer fails (IJPL-178534).
  - We've improved the appearance and behavior of editor tabs with the Show pinned tabs in a separate row option enabled so tabs no longer bounce if there is not enough (IJPL-178708).

  - We've improved the appearance of the title and the message in the Confirm add ignored file dialog (IJPL-177934).

  - No modal progress bar appears while a global inspection is running so inspections no longer block code editing (IJPL-171812).
