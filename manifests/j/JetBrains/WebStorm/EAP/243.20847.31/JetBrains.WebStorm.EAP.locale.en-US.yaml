ReleaseNotes: |-
  What's fixed:
  - We've added support for the exports field in package.json for CSS and fixed code completion not suggesting paths from it (WEB-55017 and (WEB-53576).
  - We've added the option to disable accessibility (a11y) warnings in SvelteKit, giving you more control over your development environment (WEB-62537).
  - We've fixed the issue where .prettierignore files were being ignored for subfolders containing a package.json file, ensuring correct formatting exclusion (WEB-49880).
  - We've resolved the issue where the @apply directive was incorrectly marked as unknown when using Vue with Tailwind and the Volar service enabled (WEB-64675).
  - We've fixed the issue where the Bun plugin was only available in WebStorm, ensuring it's now accessible across all supported IDEs (WEB-69579).
