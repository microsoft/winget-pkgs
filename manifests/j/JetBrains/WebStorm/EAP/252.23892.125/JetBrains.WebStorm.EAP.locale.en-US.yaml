ReleaseNotes: |-
  What's fixed:
  - We've fixed a Do not capture object instance or method parameters in documentation target builder lambda exception that was thrown on hovering over JSDoc items (WEB-73923).
  - We've fixed erroneous highlighting of imports from the jotai library as unused (WEB-73681).
  - We've added support for Jest v30, including support for testPathPatterns that substitutes for testPathPattern (WEB-73522).
  - We've fixed the behavior of the To path field in the Move refactoring dialog, so the field shows the path to the selected folder (WEB-73510).
  - We've fixed AI completion for autoimport in TypeScript (WEB-73755).
  - We've improved the Language Services widget adding actions to restart TypeScript-based LSPs (WEB-73797).
  - We've restored compatibility with Vitest --watch tests (WEB-73716).
  - We've fixed the infinite Fetching documentation issue caused by the JSLanguageService initialization timeout (WEB-73259).
  - We've fixed the View Commits link in the Update project notification popup, so the Git tool window opens on the first link invocation (IJPL-193590).
  - We've implemented forced closing a composite, or editor, or document in the backend on frontend failure (IJPL-192065).
  - We've fixed a problem in plugins sync in the Remote Development mode, so WebStorm doesn't attempt to download custom plugins from the Marketplace (IJPL-195567).
