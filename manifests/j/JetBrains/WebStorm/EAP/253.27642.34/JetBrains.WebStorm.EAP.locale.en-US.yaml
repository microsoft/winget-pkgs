  p updatesXmlOnly="true">WebStorm 2025.3 EAP 6 is now available!

  What's fixed:
  - We've fixed a problem with itemscope and itemtype HTML attributes being falsely marked as deprecated/obsolete (WEB-73881).
  - We've fixed formatting in Angular projects, so Angular HTML template references no longer cause extraneous line breaks (WEB-72583).
  - We've restored suppression for parsing SCSS files with ESLint (WEB-75196).
  - The service-powered type engine now works correctly with style objects from CSS modules (WEB-72721).
  - We've added support for the round(), rem(), and mod() CSS functions (WEB-70403).
  - We've provided a workaround for running the Add node_modules/.bin command from the terminal in WSL (WEB-74407).
  - We've updated the embedded HTML schema to the latest version, so no irrelevant Wrong attribute value warnings are shown for contenteditable="plaintext-only" (WEB-72823).
  - We've fixed alignment of inlay hints in Angular templates with $any() (WEB-75251).
  - The defer keyword is no longer removed when importing via paste in TypeScript (WEB-75245).
  - We've fixed a problem with the JavaScript debugger functionality, so HTML pages are opened and JavaScript scripts are loaded successfully (WEB-75216).
  - We've improved the GitHub and GitLab integration by implementing an option to create multiline comments on clicking the + button with multi-line selection (IJPL-200030).
  - We've implemented a check for namespaces of content modules (IJPL-209928).
  - We've improved the Grazie functionality by implementing control of whether associated rules are enabled in Writing Style rules (IJPL-203127).
  - We've disabled declarative inlay hints in the diff window to ensure that the left-hand pane shows correct results (IJPL-212615).
  - We've added FUS for tracking one side resolutions during merge (IJPL-212225).
  - We've added a registry flag to display files' indexability status in the Project View (IJPL-212197).
  - We've implemented an option to connect to the cloud for proofreading (IJPL-212186).
  - We've added a setting to enable the use of a cloud for proofreading (IJPL-212184).
  - We've extracted bugzilla and track from the tasks.core, so the xml-rpc library is used only when required (IJPL-211910).
  - OS/arch is now sent in plugin updates and search requests (IJPL-211177).
  - We've split dockerfile lang (IJPL-210247).
  - We've split the implementation of the tree view in the Build tool window, so tree components are created on the frontend while the data to display is received from the backend (IJPL-209213).
  - We've dropped the project.root.manager.over.wsm flag (IJPL-207563).
  - We've implemented a possibility to save files in the background write action (IJPL-206562).
  - We've introduced Eel API for fetching different kinds of environment variables (IJPL-204357).
  - We've implemented text spellchecking in the cloud, if the latter is available (IJPL-203135).
  - We've cleaned up a deprecated API (IJPL-190638).
  - A README.md file is now shown by default in new plugin projects (IJPL-180612).
  - We've introduced LSP-provided support for Parameter Info (textDocument/signatureHelp request) (IJPL-189556).
  - We've fixed a problem with erroneously auto-importing settings for unmanaged instances on the first IDE start (IJPL-212363).
  - We've suppressed rendering several modules in directory names when shared source support is disabled (IJPL-211774).
  - We've restored showing the filename on the tab when the diff view is opened with Show Diff for the first time (IJPL-158840).
  - We've restored preserving line separators on shelving/unshelving changes (IJPL-208047).
  - We've resolved a problem with background images being erroneously shown in tool windows (IJPL-208221).
  - We've fixed a deadlock that occurred during updates of the StopAction component (IJPL-211485).
  - We've restored showing plugins from a custom repository on the Marketplace tab of the Settings | Plugins dialog with only idea.plugin.hosts set (IJPL-210673).
  - We've fixed a build failure that occurred when running the IDE from a monorepo (IJPL-212599).
  - We've resolved a problem with the IDE failing to install dependent plugins automatically after using "Install from disk" if these plugins could be installed without restarting the IDE (IJPL-212026).
  - We've fixed a problem with two migration windows (the old and the new one) being shown at the same time on the first IDE launch (IJPL-211170).
  - We've restored syntax highlighting in diff editors during editing (IJPL-206484).
