ShortDescription: Release projects quickly and easily with JReleaser
Description: |
  JReleaser is a release automation tool. Its goal is to simplify creating releases and
  publishing artifacts to multiple package managers while providing customizable options.

  JReleaser takes inputs from popular builds tools (Ant, Maven, Gradle) such as JAR files,
  binary distributions (.zip, .tar), JLink images, or any other file that you‚Äôd like to
  publish as a Git release on popular Git services such as GitHub, GitLab, or Gitea.
  Distribution files may additionally be published to be consumed by popular package managers
  such as Homebrew, Chocolatey, Snapcraft, or get ready to be launched via JBang. Releases
  may be announced in a variety of channels such as Twitter, Zulip, SDKMAN!, and more.
