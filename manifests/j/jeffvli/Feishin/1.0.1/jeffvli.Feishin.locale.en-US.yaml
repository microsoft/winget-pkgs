  Important:
  Analytics are now being tracked in Feishin using a locally hosted instance of Umami. If you wish to opt-out, please do so under Settings -> Advanced -> Analytics
  The data being tracked is:
  - Generic platform name: e.g Web / Linux / Windows / MacOS
  - What servers you have configured in your app as a true/false value: e.g. Navidrome / Subsonic / Jellyfin
  - What version of the app you are running: e.g. v1.0.1
  - A select number of application settings defined here
  This will be subject to change in the future, but will be conveyed transparently on every change.
  In addition, all of your configured settings have been reset to default values. This was done so in order to avoid potential application errors due to the large amount of changes made between v0.22.0 and v1.0.0.
