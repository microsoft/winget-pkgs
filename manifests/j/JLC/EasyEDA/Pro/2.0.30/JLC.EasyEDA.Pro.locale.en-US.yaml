ReleaseNotes: |-
  schematic diagram
  - Optimize the performance of schematic canvas operations, including zooming, mass selection, panning, copying and pasting, cutting, etc.
  - After placing the reused block, the name and symbol name are automatically given and displayed automatically
  - The design rule adds component type check items, and the supplier number matches the component attribute
  - Bit number allocation supports bit number allocation without question marks, Chinese, etc.
  - Optimize package manager's multi-selection and scrolling list performance under a large number of components
  - Added design rules: network identification, network port needs to have a name
  - Added design rules: When wires and buses are not connected to net identifiers or net ports, the names need to be displayed on the canvas

  PCB
  - PCB supports placement of menu new graphic elements FPC reinforcement board graphic elements
  - Jigsaw dialog adapts to small resolution scenes
  - Optimizing the initial wiring logic, removing the logic that triggers the wiring to automatically start from the pad
  - Optimize the function of removing loops
  - The top and bottom test point property panels add flux extension properties, and the design rules add test point rules
  - Added non-active layer color non-attenuation configuration to be consistent with AD view habits
  - Optimization of differential pair wiring to ensure that the endpoints of the two lines are always synchronized
  - The export coordinate pop-up window supports custom attribute columns, and new support for exporting imposition mark coordinates
  - Import changes support to update copper nets at the same time
  - Chamfering is also supported for lines whose endpoints are connected but not continuous
  - A tab key switching prompt is added to scenes with multiple dynamic input boxes
  - Alignment function and attribute position function, aligning with the actual outline of the text
  - When the board is flipped, use the magnification before flipping to locate the object before flipping
  - Place/paste pads on primitives with networks, add the logic of inheriting networks
  - Increase the optimization of multi-selecting multi-segment wires and dragging wire heads
  - Add a heat welding attribute to the pad, support setting direct connection or divergence
  - The design rule dialog box supports Jiali Chuang multiple process configuration switching
  - The function of selecting the connected copper skin is added to the edit menu
  - The color of unrouted nets is also highlighted during routing
  - The arc type support in the arc property panel is recorded in the file
  - Combination optimization, no longer allow primitives in the combination to drag control points or stretch
  - In the export BOM dialog box, when the range selection is PCB, add a "layer" in the statistics

  panel
  - Panel production files, the printing layer and cover layer corresponding to the opening position will not be hollowed out
  - The filter configuration is not checked by default.
  - Added smart size function in the placement menu of the panel
  - Added auxiliary line function in the placement menu of the panel
  - Placing pictures supports restoring the original ratio
  - Support for drum cladding
  - Support panel common library, panel library creation and placement. After placement, it will be automatically broken up into multiple common primitives
  - Support dragging the bbox border to adjust the size

  other
  - Adjust the collection on the left panel, engineering-related mergers into the "Engineering Design" tab, and library-related mergers into the "Library Design" tab
  - Start page support is always displayed
  - The function of saving as a reused block is added to the reused block project
