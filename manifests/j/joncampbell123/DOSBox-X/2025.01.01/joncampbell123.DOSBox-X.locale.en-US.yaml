ShortDescription: DOSBox-X is an open-source DOS emulator for running DOS games and applications.
Description: |-
  DOSBox-X emulates a PC necessary for running many DOS games and applications that simply cannot be run on modern PCs and operating systems, similar to DOSBox.
  However, while the main focus of DOSBox is for running DOS games, DOSBox-X goes much further than this.
  Started as a fork of the DOSBox project, it retains compatibility with the wide base of DOS games and DOS gaming DOSBox was designed for.
  But it is also a platform for running DOS applications, including emulating the environments to run Windows 3.x, 9x and ME and software written for those versions of Windows.
  By adding official support for Windows 95, 98, ME emulation and acceleration, we hope that those old Windows games and applications could be enjoyed or used once more.
  Moreover, DOSBox-X adds support for DOS/V and NEC PC-98 emulations so that you can play DOS/V and PC-98 games with it.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  2025.01.01
  - Fix bug that prevented the Configuration GUI from saving to dosbox.conf
    the last Windows 3.1 theme you applied using the dropdown menu.
    (joncampbell123).
  - Add option to apply vmemdelay to SVGA and linear framebuffer
    modes (such as VESA BIOS modes), which reduces emulator performance
    for those modes, but allows you to emulate slower SVGA cards.
    Due to how some machine types are emulated, this option also enables
    vmemdelay to affect the PC-98 linear framebuffer, Tandy & PCjr
    video modes, as well as MDA/Hercules. (joncampbell123).
  - Add workaround to CPU reset logic that allows it to work correctly
    even with dynamic core. Previously, if the guest reset the system,
    the emulator would crash with an error message about an uncaught
    C++ exception because C++ exception handling doesn't work with
    dynamically generated code. (joncampbell123).
  - Correct CPUID family/model/brand values for cputype=pentium_iii.
    Add CPUID level 2, which returns "processor configuration
    descriptors", and return documented Pentium III values. Apparently
    Windows XP really REALLY cares about these configuration
    descriptors and will hang in-kernel in an infinite loop at bootup
    without these apparently really important values. This change
    makes it possible to boot Windows XP with Pentium III emulation.
    (joncampbell123).
  - Allow values of memsize to represent 4GB or more of RAM. Up to
    1TB, if Pentium PSE extensions are enabled, the memalias setting
    is 40, and "enable pse=pse40" in the conf file. Memalias maximum
    is now 40, instead of 32. Add code to provide that memory above
    the 4GB address mark when PSE is in use by the guest OS. Added
    dosbox.conf option to specify a memory file. When specified, all
    guest memory is memory-mapped from a file on disk, rather than
    allocated from host memory or host swap file. To avoid consuming
    too much RAM on the host, a memory file is REQUIRED to emulate
    memory at or above 4GB. For best performance with the memory file,
    make sure the filesystem you place it on supports sparse files,
    including Linux ext4 and Windows NTFS. (joncampbell123).
  - Fix EGA machine type to determine whether CGA RGBI or EGA RrGgBb
    display is active by vsync polarity, instead of the length of
    htotal. Several online references state that vsync is negative
    for 350-line modes, including 350-line to an MDA monitor. This
    also allows the "enhanced" EGA 320x200 modes in Rambo III to display
    colors correctly. (joncampbell123).
  - Dynamic x86 core: Reflect STI instruction to normal core so that
    the 1-instruction delay is correctly emulated. This makes it
    possible to run Windows XP or Server 2003 with dynamic core and
    SYSENTER/SYSEXIT emulation without random BSODs (joncampbell123).
  - Fix default code page. Instead of assuming 437 at all times, use
    437 for all IBM PC compatible modes and 932 for PC-98 emulation.
    (joncampbell123).
  - Normal core: Fix STI emulation to enforce the 1-instruction delay
    by forcing the normal core to execute another instruction right
    away without providing any opportunity for interrupt processing.
    This does not break Peret Em Heru, Keen games, and it seems to fix
    the random BSOD issues with Windows XP and Windows Server 2003
    when emulating a Pentium II that supports SYSENTER/SYSEXIT. I'm
    not clear on why this fix prevents them from crashing, but there
    you go. (joncampbell123).
  - Keyboard emulation: Fix PCjr key delay to match IBM documentation
    stating how long it takes to transmit one scan code, which is
    obviously much slower than normal to accomodate the slow CPU and
    the optical nature of the transmission. This is needed in order
    for emulation to correctly send Fn+key combinations. At normal
    key delay, the guest will miss scan codes and function keys will
    not be reliable. (joncampbell123).
  - Keyboard emulation: The 83-keyboard scan codes work differently on
    the PCjr keyboard because half of them are only accessible by holding
    the Fn key. The keyboard only sends the base key scan code and the Fn
    key scan code and the BIOS is expected to convert that to the normal
    83-key scan codes expected by DOS software. The problem is some games
    like "Agent USA" for PCjr are written to directly handle scan codes
    through IRQ 1 (the fact that PCjr handles keyboard via NMI and reflects
    to INT 9 is ignored here). Fix this by sending scan codes that emulate
    holding Fn and pressing the appropriate key. Agent USA expects the
    user to press F1 by holding Fn and pressing "1". (joncampbell123).
  - Revise VGA doublescan mode, vs bit 7 of the Max scanline register, to
    correct how VGA doublescans 200-line modes. Revise EGA/VGA text code
    to divide line by 2 in rendering to match double scanned scanlines,
    so that the "graphical" text of "After the War" can render properly
    for machine=vgaonly. (joncampbell123).
  - INT 10: If machine=ega, check the EGA switches on INT 10h modeset.
    Some games force the EGA BIOS to use CGA 200-line text modes by
    modifying those bits and then setting the mode ("After the War").
    (joncampbell123).
  - INT 10: Fix "load font" functions to correctly recompute video
    display end for machine=vgaonly and machine=ega. (joncampbell123).
  - INT 10: Like any other 200-line 16-color graphics mode, 200-line
    VGA text mode needs to program the AC and VGA palette using the
    CGA RGBI-type palette, not the EGA 64-color type palette. (joncampbell123).
  - CPU: Disallow clearing PE bit from LMSW by default, always.
    You can still allow it through dosbox.conf. It turns out that
    x86 CPUs never allowed you to clear it that way, even from the
    Pentium up, even though Intel documentation beyond the 386 never
    mentions it again. This fixes problems with DOS extenders and
    VCPI, particularly DOS4GW which for some reason with VCPI likes
    to try to clear the PE bit when switching to VM86 even though
    it clearly understands it's not supposed to be able to clear it.
    (joncampbell123).
  - VCPI: It turns out the VCPI server GDT selectors are expected to
    be 32-bit, because the protected mode VCPI entry point is expected
    to be called as if 32-bit far pointer. Correct VCPI entry point
    to return using RETF, not IRETD, which solves crashing issues with
    DOS extenders. For the first time, DOS extenders are working with
    the DOSBox-X built-in implementation of VCPI and most DOS games
    run fine now with it. (joncampbell123).
  - VCPI: Add code to INT 2Fh handler regarding Windows startup/shutdown
    messages to fill in DS:SI. If EMM386 and VCPI emulation is active
    and running the DOS machine in virtual 8086 mode, give Windows the
    proper callback procedure to allow Windows to switch off VCPI vm86
    mode on startup and turn it back on during shutdown. (joncampbell123).
  - BIOS "POST" screen: Change BIOS logo to PNG format. To avoid having
    to render a PNG in roughly 10 different video modes, add code to
    VGA draw code to allow a BIOS logo "overlay" to be rendered
    independent of the video mode. Depending on machine type load one
    of four PNG files from disk or from inside DOSBox-X itself.
    PNG requirements: 224x224 or smaller, bit depth of 8bpp or less,
    color palette (not grayscale), no alpha channel, and must not be
    interlaced. For best compatibility, use less than 64 colors, or
    perhaps just 16 colors. Much like the Windows 95 LOGO.SYS, you can
    change the logo to your taste by placing specifically named PNG
    files in the same directory as your dosbox.conf or current working
    directory. Have fun. Note that this addition requires that you
    compile DOSBox-X with libpng enabled. (joncampbell123).
  - Added dosbox.conf option to specify BIOS logo file. (joncampbell123).
  - Added dosbox.conf option to specify a text message, up to 3 lines,
    at the bottom of the screen during BIOS POST screen. (joncampbell123).
  - Fix color glitches in EGA, Tandy, Hercules mode on macOS SDL2 build 
    (output=opengl)(maron2000)
  - Add int33 mickey threshold option (Fixes Ultima Underworld) (jpernst)
  - Fix configure.ac (disable-screenshot option) (maron2000) 
  - Fixed codepage switching when loading language file in Traditional
    Chinese (maron2000)
  - Fixed display of some Chinese characters (Traditional Chinese)(maron2000)
  - Fixed garbled text and menubar on reset (maron2000)
  - Fixed codepage switching when a language file was loaded (maron2000)
  - sdlmain: Fixed crashing if no config files are found. (skitt)
