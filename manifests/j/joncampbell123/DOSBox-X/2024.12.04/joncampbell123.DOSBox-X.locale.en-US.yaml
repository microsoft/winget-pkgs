ShortDescription: DOSBox-X is an open-source DOS emulator for running DOS games and applications.
Description: |-
  DOSBox-X emulates a PC necessary for running many DOS games and applications that simply cannot be run on modern PCs and operating systems, similar to DOSBox.
  However, while the main focus of DOSBox is for running DOS games, DOSBox-X goes much further than this.
  Started as a fork of the DOSBox project, it retains compatibility with the wide base of DOS games and DOS gaming DOSBox was designed for.
  But it is also a platform for running DOS applications, including emulating the environments to run Windows 3.x, 9x and ME and software written for those versions of Windows.
  By adding official support for Windows 95, 98, ME emulation and acceleration, we hope that those old Windows games and applications could be enjoyed or used once more.
  Moreover, DOSBox-X adds support for DOS/V and NEC PC-98 emulations so that you can play DOS/V and PC-98 games with it.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  2024.12.04
  - Arrange memory device allocation so that it is possible to allocate
    up to about 3900MB of memory instead of 3500MB. (joncampbell123).
  - Fix S3 LFB PCI base alignment error if system memory pushes it
    to a higher address (joncampbell123).
  - Fix EGA 640x350 4-color mode (when EGA memory size is 64KB) to
    display correctly. Prior to this fix, 640x350 4-color only worked
    properly if the INT 10h Video Parameter Table was enabled. (joncampbell123).
  - Fix S3 VGA memory size reported through register CR36 to cap at 4MB
    and set the value correctly. This fixes a known issue where setting
    vmemsize to 8MB caused Windows 98 to report memory size as 2.5MB. (joncampbell123).
  - Fixed a problem when VZ Editor is resident in PC-98 mode. (nanshiki).
  - INT 10: SVGA mode 0x6A does not exist on plain VGA hardware. (joncampbell123).
  - INT 10: Fix mode 0x6A (800x600 4-color SVGA) to use a correct dot
    clock so that the refresh rate is >= 60Hz instead of 37Hz, and make
    sure mode 0x6A is a 100% clone of VESA BIOS MODE 0x102. (joncampbell123).
  - Fix MMX/SSE instruction decoding, correct some mistakes in MMX emulation. (joncampbell123).
  - IMGMAKE: Add -partofs option to allow control of where the partition
    begins in the image (joncampbell123).
  - IMGMAKE: Add -align option so that the FAT filesystem can be arranged
    for more optimal I/O on devices with larger sectors, such as modern
    4096-byte/sector drives. (joncampbell123).
  - IMGMAKE: Add -label option so that the generated FAT filesystem has the
    specified volume label. (joncampbell123).
  - MDA emulation: Fix non-blink attributes 0xF0 and 0xF8 to correctly render
    bright green background. (joncampbell123).
  - Fixed crash when a CD image was loaded to an "empty" drive (maron2000)
  - Log loaded .conf file (maron2000)
  - Supress redundant screen reports in log (maron2000)
  - Fixed mouse capture locking by middle button (maron2000) 
  - Fixed toggling the menu option "Autolock mouse" did nothing (maron2000)
  - Fixed build failure with libc++ 19 (DimitryAndric)
  - Fixed fullscreen mode not responding when launched in TTF mode 
    in Windows (maron2000)
  - Fixed crashes when changing floppies mounted by drive numbers on
    a booted guest OS (maron2000)
  - Fixed launching host programs with white spaces in path (Windows)
    (maron2000)
  - Convert paths from relative to absolute when launching host programs
    in a mounted drive (Windows) (maron2000) 
  - Added an option not to pause after host program execution is 
    completed (maron2000)
  - Fixed corrupted display when loading language files at launch
    (maron2000)
  - Fixed Z Drive path expansion to be case insensitive (maron2000)
