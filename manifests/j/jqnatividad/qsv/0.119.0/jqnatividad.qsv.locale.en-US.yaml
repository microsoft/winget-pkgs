ShortDescription: CSVs sliced, diced & analyzed.
ReleaseNotes: |-
  - diff is now out of beta and blazingly fast! Give _"the fastest CSV-diff in the world"_ a try ðŸ˜‰!
  - joinp now supports snappy automatic compression/decompression!
  - sqlp & joinp now recognize the QSV_COMMENT_CHAR environment variable, allowing you to skip comment lines in your input CSV files. They're also faster with the upgrade to Polars 0.35.4.
  - sqlp now supports subqueries, table aliases, and more!
  - luau: upgraded embedded Luau from 0.599 to 0.604; refactored code to reduce unneeded allocations and increase performance (more than doubling it!) as we prepare for extended recipe support.
  - cat is now even faster with the --flexible option. If you know your CSV files are valid, you can use this option to skip CSV validation and make cat run twice as fast!
  - qsv can now add a Byte Order Mark (BOM) header sequence to produce Excel-friendly CSVs with the QSV_OUTPUT_BOM environment variable.
  - stats, sort, schema & validate are now faster with the use of atoi_simd to directly convert &[u8] to integer, skipping unnecessary utf8 validation, while also using SIMD CPU instructions for noticeably faster performance.
