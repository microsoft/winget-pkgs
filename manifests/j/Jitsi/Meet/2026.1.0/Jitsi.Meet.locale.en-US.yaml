  Notable Changes
  - Update to electron 39. This drops support for macOS 11. Now macOS 12 is required as a minimum, as Chromium has dropped macOS 11 as well. By @saghul in #1057
  - Use new picture-in-picture feature from jitsi-meet (available since 2.0.10710 (2026-01-14)). In case the feature does not work, you need to update your jitsi server to at least 2.0.10710. By @saghul in #1057
