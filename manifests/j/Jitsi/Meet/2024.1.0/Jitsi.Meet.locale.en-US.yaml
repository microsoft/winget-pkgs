  What's Changed
  - fix: add sandbox permission to iframe by @andreicon in #926
  - fix(main): filter out frame-ancestors if exists in Content-Security-Policy by @emrahcom in #938
  - chore(deps) update electron to 28.1.3 by @csett86 in #941
  Notes
  - Linux: With electron 28 there is now a env variable to control the x11/wayland settings under linux: ELECTRON_OZONE_PLATFORM_HINT.
    Set it to auto and it will use wayland when running under wayland and x11 when running within X or as Xwayland.
    Default is empty and then x11/xwayland will be used.
