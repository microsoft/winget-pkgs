  What's Changed
  Lots of great changes in this release. Thanks to everybody who contributed!
  Enhancements üî•
  - Per-repo config files (and reloading of edited config files) by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3787
    - In addition to the global config file you can now create repo-specific config files in <repo>/.git/lazygit.yml. Settings in these files override settings in the global config file. In addition, files called .lazygit.yml in any of the parent directories of a repo will also be loaded; this can be useful if you have settings that you want to apply to a group of repositories.
    - We now also automatically apply (most) config changes without the need to restart lazygit
  - Easily view diff across range of commits by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3869
    - If you select a range of commits, we now show the diff across the range (inclusive). This makes it easy to see the total changes across a number of commits. Likewise, if you press enter when a range of commits are selected, we will show the changed files for the range.

  - Support hyperlinks from pagers by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3825
    - If you're using delta as a pager (which I highly recommend trying), you can now click on line numbers to go to that line in your editor
    git:
        paging:
          colorArg: always
      	    pager: delta --paging=never --hyperlinks --line-numbers
    If you're using vscode, use the following config:
    git:
        paging:
          colorArg: always
      	    pager: delta --paging=never --hyperlinks --line-numbers  --hyperlinks-file-link-format="vscode://file/{path}:{line}"

  - Switch to Files panel after popping/applying a stash by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3888
    - This is a nice quality of life improvement. You generally want to go straight to the files panel after you pop or apply from the stash
  - Ask to auto-stage unstaged files when continuing a rebase after resolving conflicts by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3879
    - Another quality of life improvement: often you resolve some conflicts, then make another couple changes, then in lazygit you say to continue and you get an error saying there are unstaged changes. Now instead of showing an error, lazygit asks if you want to stage those changes and continue.
  - Offer autostash option when creating new branch by @brandondong in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3871
    - Another great quality of life improvement
  - Allow using shell aliases in interactive custom commands by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3793
  - Switch tabs with panel jump keys by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3794
    - If you've already been using the number keys (1-5) for jumping to specific side panels, you'll be pleased to know that you can now also use those keys for jumping to tabs within a side panel. E.g. to go to the reflog panel, you can now press 4 to jump to the commits panel, then 4 again to go to the reflog tab.
  - Rename "Custom Command" to "Shell Command" by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3800
    - There are two ways of invoking a 'custom' command in Lazygit: first by pre-defining a command in your config, and second by pressing ':' and typing in the command directly. We referred to both of these as 'custom commands' which was confusing. We now refer to the second approach as invoking a 'shell command'.
  - Improve template placeholders for custom commands by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3809
    - Now you can use SelectedCommit to refer to the selected commit regardless of which commits panel you're in (local commits, reflog, etc)
    - Likewise, you can use SelectedPath whether you're in the files panel or the commit-files panel.
  - feat(custom command): support multiple contexts within one command by @yam-liu in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3784
    - You can now use a comma-separated list of contexts for which a custom command can be invoked. For example:
    customCommands:
        - description: 'Add empty commit'
          key: 'E'
          context: 'commits,files'
  - Improve mouse support for commit message panel by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3836
  - Make auto-staging resolved conflicts optional by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3870
    - If you set git.autoStageResolvedConflicts to false in your config, lazygit will no longer auto-stage files in which you've resolved merge conflicts.
  - Allow using </> and ,/. in sticky range select mode in patch explorer by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3837
  - Add Zed editor support to editorPreset by @susl in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3886
