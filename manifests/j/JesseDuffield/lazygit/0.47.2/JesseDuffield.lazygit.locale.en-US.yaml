ReleaseNotes: |-
  Small patch release for you all. This is mainly to fix an issue with v0.47.1 which erroneously re-indented users' lazygit config files on startup.
  Shout-out to @karimkhaleel for his PR with some gnarly yaml-handling code.
  And a special shout-out to @ChrisMcD1 who has been pumping out many great contributions lately. Great to have you aboard.
