ReleaseNotes: |-
  Again we don't have any major new features this time (unless you count the support for alt-backspace for deleting words in the commit message editor, which is one of my favorite additions), but lots of smaller quality-of-life improvements and bug fixes. The most notable one is probably the fix for the stale index.lock problem, which was a very long-standing bug that seemed to affect some users much more than others for some reason.
