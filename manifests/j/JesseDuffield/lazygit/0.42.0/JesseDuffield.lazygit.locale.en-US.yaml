ReleaseNotes: |-
  It's time once again for a Lazygit release! This one is not as colossal as the prior release (and we intend to have smaller, more frequent releases in future) but there are plenty of good improvements here.
  Thanks to all contributors who helped make this release happen! There's a lot of first-time contributors on this release as well so kudos to you all.
  Thanks as usual to the wonderful @stefanhaller for creating/reviewing many of these changes, and thanks to @karimkhaleel who has also stepped up to help out with reviews.
