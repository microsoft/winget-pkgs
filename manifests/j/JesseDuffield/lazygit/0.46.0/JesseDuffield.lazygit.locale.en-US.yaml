ReleaseNotes: |-
  It's time for another Lazygit release! Thanks to all who contributed to this release.
  What's Changed
  Enhancements üî•
  - Preserve pending commit message when closing/re-opening by @AzraelSec in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/4191
  - Swap position of checkout-commit and checkout-branch menu items by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/4238
    - In a previous release we had made it so that when you press space on a commit, the first option in the menu was to check out the corresponding branch, rather than the commit itself. We've made it so that now the first option is to check out the commit itself, for the sake of everybody's muscle memory.
