ReleaseNotes: |-
  Added
  - Percentage based scrolling when using "gg" or "G" with a count, similar to Vim
  - Action "startFollowCopyLink" for copying links of selected elements in follow mode
  - Setting "darkreadermode" to switch between light and dark schemes/modes for darkreader
  - Settings "resourcetypes", "resourcesallowed" and "resourcesblocked" to control allowed/blocked resource types
  - Setting "shell" to control the shell to use for system commands
  - Live indicator of current theme preference to the nativetheme help documentation

  Changed
  - Maximum values of darkreader brightness and contrast settings from 100 to 200 percent
  - Buffer-like command suggestions to be in sync with actual behavior
  - Buffer-like command suggestions to include the page url
  - Check if the entire body is scrollable instead of the window for global scroll actions and scrollpos
  - Prevent navigation to invalid urls to make sure a page can always be interacted with
  - Shell now reads "$SHELL" instead of defaulting to "/bin/sh" for system commands

  Fixed
  - Action "openNewTabWithCurrentUrl" not working at all in last release due to unsafe check
  - Duplicate downloads due to page restart workaround (which is now fixed by Electron)

  Versions
  - Electron 22.0.0-beta.5 (was 21.1.0)
  - Chromium 108.0.5359.40 (was 106.0.5249.91)
