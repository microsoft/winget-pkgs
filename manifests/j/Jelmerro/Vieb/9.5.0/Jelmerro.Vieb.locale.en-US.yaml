ReleaseNotes: |-
  Added
  - Startup argument "--unsafe-multiwin" to have multiple windows in the same datafolder and skip the single instance safety check
  - Command "translatepage" to translate the page using Deepl API or LibreTranslate
  - Settings "translateapi", "translatekey", "translatelang" and "translateurl" to customize translation settings for ":translatepage"
  - Setting "permissionclipboardwrite", as clipboard writing was recently moved to a permission by Electron (default remains allowed)
  - Settings "replacespecial" and "replacestartup" to control when new pages should re-use/replace the current tab

  Changed
  - Rpm and deb releases are now symlinked in /usr/bin correctly on updates after this one
  - Confirm char "!" for special page commands now opens them in a new tab regardless of the new "replacespecial" setting

  Fixed
  - Recursive key mappings not working correctly when the timeout is reached and there are also multi-key mappings
  - Cache errors/corruption on Windows upon restart after clearing/disabling cache
  - Setting externalcommand is now actually used for opening new tabs externally (fallback remains the default browser)
  - Exception popup on Linux when quitting if using window frame borders
  - Valid urls without protocol not always being recognized as a startup argument

  Versions
  - Electron 22.0.0 (was 22.0.0-beta.5)
  - Chromium 108.0.5359.62 (was 108.0.5359.40)
