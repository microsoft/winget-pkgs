ReleaseNotes: |-
  Added
  - Setting "suspendplayingtab" to control if tabs playing media should be suspended by suspendtimeout
  - Settings "dialogalert", "dialogconfirm" and "dialogprompt" to control if dialogs should show and/or be logged at all
  - Permissions for serial and other human interface devices (permissionserial, permissionhid, both blocked by default, same as before)
  - Default mappings that make use of the last used tab argument (for example "close #") of buffer like commands (prefixed with "B")
  Changed
  - Useragent was modified to the upcoming reduced/simplified version of the final phase of https://www.chromium.org/updates/ua-reduction/
  - Battery API now returns fixed "no battery" values instead of being undefined
  - The SSL error filter now includes more ERR codes by looking for "CERT" and "SSL" instead of using a fixed list
  - Attempt to delete blocked navigator properties from navigator object completely instead of returning undefined
  - Disable useragentdata client hints API completely (previously only in Firefox mode)
  - The last used tab variable will now as a fallback pick the first tab instead of opening a new search tab with "buffer" and "Vexplore"
  Removed
  - Plugins and mimeTypes overrides in favor of default hard-coded PDF plugin and mimetype lists (as per Firefox and Chromium)
  Fixed
  - Reloadconfig command not resetting permissions (and other webview/main thread settings) in some cases
  - Crash when pressing cancel in the print dialog (fixed by upgrading Electron)
  - Interaction with other pages not working when the debugger is paused (due to overlay, which is now disabled by default for new sessions)
  Versions
  - Electron 18.0.1 (was 17.0.1)
  - Chromium 100.0.4896.60 (was 98.0.4758.82)
