  - Option to write command to save pages as MHTML instead of just HTML
  - Setting "windowfullscreen" to allow the fullscreen state to be kept after restart (default "restore")

  Fixed
  - Download success notification showing in info color instead of success color
  - Occasional error popup when viewing SVGs directly because of style injection refusal
  - Markdownviewer not supporting local images due to file access limits
  - GUI-related settings not hiding after follow and pointer actions due to pointer being in mouse override position
  - Mapped insert mode inputs with shifted keys sending the keys twice or not at all when unshifted variant exists
  - Non-recursive insert mode special keys not always being called with the correct name (hence arrows not working)
