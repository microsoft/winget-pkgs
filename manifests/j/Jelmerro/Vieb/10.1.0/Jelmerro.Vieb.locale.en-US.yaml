  Added
  - Option "external" to "pdfbehavior" setting to open the pdf with externalcommand automatically

  Fixed
  - Settings starting with "no" or "inv" not being able to be listed without "?" nor reporting the correct name
  - Actions "nextPage" and "previousPage" no longer working for link elements
  - Pointer scrolling to search results not working correctly due to Electron's inconsistent API
  - Infinite loading issue for unresponsive pages due to loadurl rework
  - Newtab actions for pointer mode not working due to tab still loading
  - Errors for ipc calls to webview that are still being created by only sending data to webview with ready dom
  - First navigation issue that requires a second mouse click to navigate by delaying the useragent reroll
  - Relative feed URLs only returning the path (they are now prefixed with the current url as needed)
  - Firefox version calculation being ahead of time due to delayed Firefox releases

  Versions
  - Electron 25.2.0 (was 25.1.1)
  - Chromium 114.0.5735.134 (was 114.0.5735.106)
