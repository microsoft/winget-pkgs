ReleaseNotes: |-
  Added
  - Setting "useragent" to use any number of custom useragents (either one, or a list that is randomly used per page load)
  - Settings "encodeurlcopy" and "encodeurlext" to control the percent encoding/decoding of the urls
  - Script-based blocking of ads in the adblocker, for example to block Youtube and Twitch ads
  - Support for "prompt" dialogs, and thus "show" and "notifyshow" are now valid values for "dialogprompt"
  - Mouse option named "movepointer" which moves the pointer to the click location
  - Actions "toggleSourceViewer" and "toggleSourceViewerNewTab" to toggle the new theme supported "sourceviewer"
  - Actions "toggleReaderView" and "toggleReaderViewNewTab" to toggle the new theme supported "readerview"
  - More default themes: numberedtabs and compact (thanks to @stevkazt)

  Changed
  - Setting "windowtitle" now accepts a custom string with variables instead of hard-coded formats (linking to password managers should be easier now)
  - Dialog settings are now all blocked with notifications by default
  - Duplicate download numbering now starts from (1) instead of (2)
  - Duplicate download name for files that end in "tar.something" will now have the counter before the ".tar"
  - Iframes are now isolated properly, making them faster and more secure (no more infinite loop to set listeners for them)
  - Privacy overrides are now always done with a preload, making them faster and more secure (no more infinite loop to patch them)
  - Increase default timeoutlen above Vim's level because it makes more sense for Vieb
  - Rename "fontsize" to "guifontsize" to make it more clear where the font size applies
  - Url detection logic to be more in line with the actual spec, resulting in simpler implementation
  - Downloadpath is now empty by default and will read XDG_DOWNLOAD_DIR/xdg-user-dirs (with the same fallback to ~/Downloads as before)
  - Give "storenewvisits" new options for "sourceviewer" and "readerview", and rename "builtin" to "special" to make more sense

  Removed
  - Action "toLastUsedTab" in favor of using ":buffer #" in line with other buffer-like commands that support "#"
  - Startup option to enable strict site isolation, it is now strictly isolated at all times
  - CSS transitions from default theme (specifically on the mode selector)

  Fixed
  - Command "reloadconfig" did actually reset the settings instead of just reload them
  - Urls prefixed with a protocol not being checked if they are navigable urls at all (possibly resulting in broken tabs if navigated to)
  - Race condition on unsuspending tabs and opening tabs with a url directly that led to empty pages
  - Composing keyboards typing out the keys in addition to the composed keys on macos
  - Internal errors for looping over pages when some of them are suspended (in case of zooming, page capturing, or save page)
  - Follow links (or their labels) not being visible if an element continues outside the visible section of the page

  Versions
  - Electron 19.0.3 (was 18.0.1)
  - Chromium 102.0.5005.63 (was 100.0.4896.60)
