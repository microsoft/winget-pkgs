ReleaseNotes: |-
  Added
  - Range prefix support for many different commands
  - Buffer-like commands now accept "#" to specify the last used tab
  - Actions "startFollowNewSplit" and "startFollowNewVerSplit" to open links in splits with follow mode
  - Setting "inputfocusalignment" to align input fields consistently on focus from follow mode
  - Command "runjsinpage" to run any JavaScript inside the current page or pages matching a range
  - Context menu options for opening any link in a split of vsplit, such as "split audio link" or "vsplit selected text"
  - Pointer mode actions for opening splits of media urls, hovered urls or selected text, such as "splitAudio" or "vsplitText"
  - Two new types of links in follow mode: media (audio/video elements) and images (img, svg and background images)
  - Setting "followelementpointer" to control which elements should appear in follow mode when used to move the pointer
  - Setting "notificationforsystemcommands" to enable or disable notifications for successful or failed system commands
  - Setting "followchars" to specify exactly which characters should be used to select elements on the page
  - Setting "followfallbackaction" to control what happens on pressing chars not part of followchars (new default is to filter results)
  - Command "tabnew" and "tabnewcontainer" to open a new tab programmatically optionally with a custom container name
  - Setting "containernames" to control which container names should be used for new tabs with a specific url (based on regex patterns)
  Changed
  - Desktop capture API is now called from main thread and shows the app icons
  - Command "reload" to "reloadconfig" to avoid confusion
  - Actions "reload" and "reloadWithoutCache" are now called "refreshTab" and "refreshTabWithoutCache" to avoid confusion
  - Consistency between menu items and reduced the amount of words in them for easier scanning
  - Override for atob and btoa functions so they accept a wider range of characters instead of throwing errors (fixes Protonmail login issue)
  Removed
  - Longtime workaround for electron-builder to manually create the mac zips (they are now valid zip archives instead of being broken)
  - Compatibility linter plugin compat, as it's no longer needed due to widespread release of newer node verions
  Fixed
  - Resolve file paths with query param characters in them and update the url accordingly
  - Background color override not checking for background images before applying
  - Mouse forward and back buttons not working on Windows
  - Rare crash when the devtools would remain after deleting the webview and you would then interact with it, they are now closed along with the page
  - Potential switch to insert mode after clicking on multiple links before leaving follow mode (by using Shift or right-clicking)
  Security
  - Electron 17.0.0-beta.4 (was 15.3.1)
  - Chromium 98.0.4758.11 (was 94.0.4606.81)
