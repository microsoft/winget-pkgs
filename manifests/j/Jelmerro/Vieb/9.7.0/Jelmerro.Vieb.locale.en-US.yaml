ReleaseNotes: |-
  Added
  - Command "clear" to wipe browsing data based on intervals or partial urls (currently only history)
  - Setting "clearhistoryinterval" to more finely control the deletion of history on quit by interval
  - Option "url" to the list of mouse features to control interaction with the input box while already typing (default on)
  - Option "leaveinsert" to the list of mouse features to control if clicking outside the page should leave insert mode (default on)
  - Option "notification" to the list of mouse features to control if clicking the download notification should open the file (default on)
  - Setting "mousedisabledbehavior" to control if elements with no enabled mouse interaction should optionally drag the window (nothing by default)
  - Setting "guiscrollbar" to control if and when the scrollbar should appear on pages (default remains always on)
  - Documentation for all modes by mode name instead of just the action name (also means better sorted actions)
  - More values to "dialogconfirm" to automatically allow the confirm dialog without needing to show it
  - More default mappings that are similar to Firefox/Chromium
  - Favicon icons to the buffer command suggestions for better recognition
  - Actions "startRecording", "stopRecording" and "runRecording" to record key presses and later execute them (macros/records in Vim)

  Changed
  - Resetting focus now happens on every user interaction instead of on a timer
  - Url can now be selected from outside explore mode directly (and keep the selection if switching to explore mode)
  - History storage is now slightly faster by only wiping empty entries on write
  - Settings now have links to documentation about the type of value they can contain
  - Naming scheme of setting types is now more streamlined and better documented
  - Searchword urls are now filled in with the resolved url in the suggestions while you type
  - Seachwords will now also activate if prefixed with spaces
  - Filetype suggestions coming from history are now correctly colored in history color instead of file suggest color
  - Default theme now shows the default cursor instead of the text cursor on the url box if interaction is disabled
  - Locales are now included in regular releases but still excluded from lite builds (see build.js)
  - All mouse features now have a "mouse-something" className added to the body if enabled to allow more customization in colorschemes
  - Action "menuOpen" will now keep working even if the settings are set to never, this does not affect regular right clicks
  - Userstyles are now also applied when the DOM is ready, not just when the page is fully loaded
  - Commands "screencopy" and "screenshot" will show the screen highlight even without entering all 4 dimension values
  - Single key mapping commands now also combine different modes into one map command if all modes have the same mapping
  - Buffer commands now search for matches the same way as explore mode, as do the suggestions

  Deprecated
  - Setting clearhistoryonquit in favor of clearhistoryinterval=session
  - Default value for "replacespecial" being "newtab" (will change to "special" in 10.x.x)
  - Setting search in favor of the functionality identical searchengine setting
  - Ctrl-c default mapping for the stopLoadingPage action instead of the new Esc
  - Boolean toggling restoretabs in favor providing a value (toggle commands will stop working in 10.x.x)
  - Boolean toggling notificationforpermisions in favor providing a value (toggle commands will stop working in 10.x.x)
  - Action "openNewTab" in favor of running the ":tabnew" command

  Fixed
  - Vieb right click menu not working due to removed .path in events
  - Follow filtering being cancelled when interacting with the navbar using the mouse
  - Explore mode history not storing the first change in the Ctrl-z/Ctrl-y history
  - Middle mouse paste not updating explore mode's Ctrl-z/Ctrl-y history
  - Self closing tabs not being cleaned up correctly due to Electron devtools close call being unsafe
  - Text selection still briefly being visible outside explore mode when toexplore mouse feature is disabled
  - Websocket connections being blocked when setting custom resourcetypes due to casing error
  - Mousefeature history always being on even if not in the list of enabled features
  - Mode selector not being as big as it should be and therefor closing the dropdown occasionally
  - Sites without a div and without proper background not getting the default white background
  - Pointer mode help commands going to the action if they have the same name
  - Ctrl-F4 to close tab default mapping not working
  - Default text value for prompt dialogs not being used
  - Iframe position not being shifted correctly for iframes inside a same origin iframe
