ReleaseNotes: |-
  Added
  - Special type of notification for dialog inform notifications, which can be colored separately
  - Setting "suggestbouncedelay" to control the debounce delay of suggestions, to handle fast typing better
  - Setting "darkreaderblocklist" to block specific sites (regular expressions) from using darkreader, even if enabled
  - Setting "userstyle" to toggle loading of custom CSS files into the page, either globally or per-domain
  - Actions "toggleMarkdownViewer" and "toggleMarkdownViewerNewTab" to toggle the new theme supported "markdownviewer"
  - Setting "nativetheme" to control the theme to report to pages, used by the "prefers-color-scheme" CSS rule
  - Quickmarks to store and reload scroll positions, pointer positions and page urls quickly
  - Commands "marks", "restoremark", "delmarks", "pointerpos", "restorepointerpos", "delpointerpos", "scrollpos", "restorescrollpos" and "delscrollpos" to list and delete quickmarks
  - Settings "quickmarkpersistence", "pointerpostype", "pointerposlocalid", "scrollpostype", "scrollposlocalid", "markposition" and "markpositionshifted" to control quickmarks
  - Actions "storeScrollPos", "restoreScrollPos", "p.storePos", "p.restorePos", "makeMark" and "restoreMark" to add and load quickmarks
  - Webpack compilation to the released builds, for better tree-shaking and minified code
  - Separate "lite" build/release that does not have any dependency packages installed

  Changed
  - Only show notification popup for notifications with lots of newlines
  - Examples are now downloaded as blobs instead of files to allow them to be bundled in the asar file for releases
  - Startup argument "--debug" is now called "--devtools" to avoid nodejs argument conflict
  - Give "storenewvisits" a new option for "markdownviewer"
  - Logic for staying in follow mode after selecting something is now more consistent in remembering the previous mode
  - Main process devtools are now always undocked to prevent window size issues
  - Follow mode logic to use the much faster async IntersectionObserver instead of sync API
  - Follow mode logic to be faster if fewer element types are queried
  - Use Electron's clickOnSearch implementation in favor of Vieb's custom one
  - Setting "containernames" now also works for current tab navigation, unless you tell it not to with the "~newtab" suffix
  - Use regex to detect SVG favicons instead of relying on "is-svg" dependency
  - Use nodejs filesystem API instead of relying on "rimraf" dependency
  - All runtime dependencies are now loaded safely, and will show a message when missing (this makes ALL dependencies optional)
  - Custom icon and name are now shown on the version page as well
  - Only include en-US locale in builds to decrease build size significantly
  - Invalid or missing chrome:// pages are now redirected to their Vieb counterpart (if it exists) or the help page

  Removed
  - Extension support, see this Github issue to learn more
  - Setting "firefoxmode" in favor of setting the "useragent" setting to a Firefox useragent

  Fixed
  - Suspended tabs sometimes failing to wake up correctly
  - Commands :rclose and :lclose not working correctly when there are suspended tabs
  - Race condition in opening new tabs with urls that would sometimes unsuspend them twice
  - White background on some pages that load page styling async and in reloaded iframes
  - Error popup from the main thread regarding discarded frames
  - White background on pages with dark color-scheme preference and no custom styling

  Versions
  - Electron 20.0.2 (was 19.0.6)
  - Chromium 104.0.5112.81 (was 102.0.5005.115)
