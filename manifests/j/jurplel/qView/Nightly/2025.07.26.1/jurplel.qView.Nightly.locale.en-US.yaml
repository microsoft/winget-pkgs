ShortDescription: qView is an image viewer designed with minimalism and usability in mind.
Description: |-
  qView was designed from the very start to be as visually minimal and space efficient as possible. No cluttered interface, just your image and a titlebar.

  You shouldn't have to wait just to view an imageâ€”qView opens practically instantly, and switching images is just as quick, all while having low memory and CPU usage.

  With features such as animated GIF controls, file history, rotation/mirroring, and multithreaded preloading, minimalism doesn't have to be a compromise.

  Latest automatic build from the master branch. Might be broken.
