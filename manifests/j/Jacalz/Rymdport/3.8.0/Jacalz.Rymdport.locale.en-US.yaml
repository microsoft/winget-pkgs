Description: Rymdport (formerly wormhole-gui) is a cross-platform application that lets you easily and safely share files, folders, and text between devices. The data is sent securely with end-to-end encryption using the same protocol as magic-wormhole. This means that Rymdport can talk not only to itself, but also to other wormhole clients.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  While I had not initially planned another release before v4.0.0, I have been focused mostly on other projects and not quite had the time to continue the work on the major rework just yet. There might potentially be a v3.9.0 release as well to round off the v3 versions on a high note.
  This release is ready with various fixes and improvements in the meantime. On the infrastructure side, Go 1.23 is now used to build release binaries so release binaries will again be available for all previous supported platforms including new binaries for 64-bit Windows ARM.

  - Updated fyne to v2.5.4.
    - Most notable here is a fix for the progress bar lacking text sometimes.
  - Multiple other dependencies have been updated for various improvements and fixes.
