ShortDescription: Bring your PC to its limits with the freeware stress test tool HeavyLoad. HeavyLoad puts your workstation or server PC under a heavy load and lets you test whether they will still run reliably.
Description: |-
  HeavyLoad is a free Windows stress-testing tool that pushes your PC to its limits by maxing out CPU, RAM, disk, GPU, and network resources to test system stability, cooling, and reliability under extreme loads

  Key Features:
  - Multi-Component Testing: Simultaneously stresses CPUs (all cores), GPUs (via 3D rendering), RAM (physical/virtual memory allocation), disks (read/write tests), and networks.
  - Real-Time Monitoring: Graphs CPU usage, memory availability, disk space, and FPS during tests.
  - Customization: Adjust test intensity per component, set duration, and define free-space/memory thresholds.
  - "Maximum Terror" Button: One-click full-system stress test

ReleaseNotes: |-
  * HeavyLoad now also supports installation on ARM64 systems.
  * The CPU stress tests have been revised. Instead of the previous factorial calculations, a matrix calculation is now used. The new calculation generates a significantly higher CPU load, which enables more realistic stress tests.
  * The graphics card stress test has been improved so that a higher load is generated.
  * An error that could occur in rare cases during program startup has been fixed.
  * An error that could occur in rare cases during the graphics card stress test has been fixed.
  * Support for the outdated Windows Server 2012 R2 and Windows 8.1 operating systems has been discontinued.
