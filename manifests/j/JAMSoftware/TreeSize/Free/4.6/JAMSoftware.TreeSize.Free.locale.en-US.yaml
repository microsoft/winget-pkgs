ReleaseNotes: |-
  - With TreeSize Free, individual PDF reports can now be created. The columns are exported as they are displayed in the Details list.
  - The columns of the Details list can now be activated and deactivated via a new dropdown menu in the “View” tab.
  - A new drop-down menu in the “View” tab offers a wider range of sorting options for the Details list.
  - TreeSize Free is now provided as a 64-bit application. This avoids rare compatibility problems under 64-bit operating systems, and the usable memory is no longer a limit for scanning very large file systems. If you still have a 32-bit Windows operating system, please continue to use V4.5.   
  - The dialogue for adding scan filters has been renewed. The new dialogue is more user-friendly and offers additional functions for combining filters.
  - The export and print options can now also be adjusted in the “Scan” tab.
  - TreeSize Free is now also available in other languages: Norwegian, Romanian, Turkish, Bulgarian and Danish.
  - A bug that throws an exception when opening the error list when the dark mode is active has been fixed.
  - Fixed an error when compressing multiple files at the same time.
