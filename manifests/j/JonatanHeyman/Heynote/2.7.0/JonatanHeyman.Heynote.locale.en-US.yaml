ShortDescription: A dedicated scratchpad for developers
Description: |-
  Heynote is a dedicated scratchpad for developers. It functions as a large persistent text buffer where you can write down anything you like. Works great for that Slack message you don't want to accidentally send, a JSON response from an API you're working with, notes from a meeting, your daily to-do list, etc.
  The Heynote buffer is divided into blocks, and each block can have its own Language set (e.g. JavaScript, JSON, Markdown, etc.). This gives you syntax highlighting and lets you auto-format that JSON response.
  Available for Mac, Windows, and Linux.
ReleaseNotes: |-
  What's Changed
  Non backwards-compatible change
  Buffers created/saved with this new version of Heynote is not compatible with older versions of Heynote,
  so if you're using Heynote on multiple machines, make sure to update to >=2.7 on all machines.
  Creation time for blocks
  The time of creation is now recorded for blocks, and it's displayed in the status bar. For folded blocks,
  it's also displayed in the summary line.
  Add new block and scroll down
  A new command for adding a new block at the end of the buffer and then scrolling down so that only the new
  block is visible has been added. This can be used to create a new block and avoid any distraction from seeing
  the other blocks above while writing.
  The default key binding for Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+Enter has been changed to this new command, but anyone who would
  prefer the old behaviour, can add a key binding for the Add new block after last block command.
  Other fixes and improvements
  - The default key binding for the TAB key is now a new insertIndentation command. This command will insert
    indentation character(s) (spaces or tabs depending on the setting) so that the cursor aligns with the indentation
    columns. Unless there is an active selection, in which case the indentMore command will be executed instead.
    If you want the old behaviour, you can bind the TAB key to indentMore.
  - Chinese characters in buffer file names are now converted to ascii using pinyin. This fixes an issue where it
    wasn't possible to create a buffer with only chinese characters it the name.
  - Fix issue where the wrong locale was used for formatting dates on MacOS on systems using a locale such as "en-SE"
  - Fix issue with folded Math blocks where the results from the first and last line would still be visible
  - Always use 2-digit notation for hours when displaying time
  - Add setting for configuring the cursor blink rate (or turning off the blinking)
  - Add support for Lua blocks
  - Add toggleCheckbox command for Markdown todo items (default key binding: Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+Space)
  - Fix issue when selecting all content of a math block and typing a character
  - Fix so that checkboxes in todo lists takes up 4 spaces so that the margin align for multi line list items
