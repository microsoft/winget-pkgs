ShortDescription: A dedicated scratchpad for developers
Description: |-
  Heynote is a dedicated scratchpad for developers. It functions as a large persistent text buffer where you can write down anything you like. Works great for that Slack message you don't want to accidentally send, a JSON response from an API you're working with, notes from a meeting, your daily to-do list, etc.
  The Heynote buffer is divided into blocks, and each block can have its own Language set (e.g. JavaScript, JSON, Markdown, etc.). This gives you syntax highlighting and lets you auto-format that JSON response.
  Available for Mac, Windows, and Linux.

  Images can be selected and resized directly in the editor, and it's quick and easy to put an image back
  on the system clipboard.

  Drawing on images
  Heynote now includes a lightweight drawing tool for adding quick, freehand annotations on top of images.
