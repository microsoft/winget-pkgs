ShortDescription: A dedicated scratchpad for developers
Description: |-
  Heynote is a dedicated scratchpad for developers. It functions as a large persistent text buffer where you can write down anything you like. Works great for that Slack message you don't want to accidentally send, a JSON response from an API you're working with, notes from a meeting, your daily to-do list, etc.
  The Heynote buffer is divided into blocks, and each block can have its own Language set (e.g. JavaScript, JSON, Markdown, etc.). This gives you syntax highlighting and lets you auto-format that JSON response.
  Available for Mac, Windows, and Linux.
ReleaseNotes: |-
  New Features
  - Added support for moving the current block to another (or new) buffer. Pressing Ctrl/Cmd+S will now pop up a dialog where you can search for and select another buffer to which the block will be moved. It's also possible to select to create a new buffer to which the block will be moved.
  - Add right click context menu with undo/redo/cut/copy/paste/select all as well as Delete Block and Move block to another buffer.
  - Add File menu item for switching buffer
  - When deleting a block, the cursor will now end up at the beginning of the next block, instead of at the end of the previous block.
  - Added support for the following languages:
    - Elixir
    - Scala
  - PHP blocks no longer requires <?php for syntax highlighting to work
  Bug Fixes
  - MacOS: Clicking the Heynote icon in the dock when using menu bar mode didn't bring up the window
  - Redo from the application menu didn't work
