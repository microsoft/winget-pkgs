ShortDescription: A dedicated scratchpad for developers
Description: |-
  Heynote is a dedicated scratchpad for developers. It functions as a large persistent text buffer where you can write down anything you like. Works great for that Slack message you don't want to accidentally send, a JSON response from an API you're working with, notes from a meeting, your daily to-do list, etc.
  The Heynote buffer is divided into blocks, and each block can have its own Language set (e.g. JavaScript, JSON, Markdown, etc.). This gives you syntax highlighting and lets you auto-format that JSON response.
  Available for Mac, Windows, and Linux.
ReleaseNotes: |-
  Improved search functionality
  The new search (and replace) dialog has an improved UI and is now "block aware", meaning that one can choose to search within the current block or across all blocks. The search settings (within the current block, case sensitivity, whole words) also affects the Cmd/Ctrl-D command for selecting the next occurrence of the current selection.
  Other fixes and improvements
  - Fix issues with todo lists checkboxes in Markdown blocks
  - Fix issue with markdown blocks sometimes not being fully folded
