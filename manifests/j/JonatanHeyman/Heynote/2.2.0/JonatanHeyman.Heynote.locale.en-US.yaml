ShortDescription: A dedicated scratchpad for developers
Description: |-
  Heynote is a dedicated scratchpad for developers. It functions as a large persistent text buffer where you can write down anything you like. Works great for that Slack message you don't want to accidentally send, a JSON response from an API you're working with, notes from a meeting, your daily to-do list, etc.
  The Heynote buffer is divided into blocks, and each block can have its own Language set (e.g. JavaScript, JSON, Markdown, etc.). This gives you syntax highlighting and lets you auto-format that JSON response.
  Available for Mac, Windows, and Linux.
ReleaseNotes: |-
  New Features
  - Added support for custom key bindings. See the documentation for more info.
  - Added a "command palette" that can be accessed by pressing Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+P, or just typing > in the buffer selector. The command palette allows you to discover all available commands in the app, and to quickly execute them.
  - Added support for configuring the tab size, as well as the option to use tabs instead of spaces for indentation.
  - Added functionality for moving blocks up and down. Default key bindings are Ctrl/Cmd+Alt+Shift+Up and Ctrl/Cmd+Alt+Shift+Down.
  - Added functionality for inserting the current date and time. Default key binding is Alt+Shift+D.
  Other changes
  - Upgraded to latest version of Electron, CodeMirror, Vue, electron-builder and other dependencies.
