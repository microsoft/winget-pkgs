ShortDescription: A dedicated scratchpad for developers
Description: |-
  Heynote is a dedicated scratchpad for developers. It functions as a large persistent text buffer where you can write down anything you like. Works great for that Slack message you don't want to accidentally send, a JSON response from an API you're working with, notes from a meeting, your daily to-do list, etc.
  The Heynote buffer is divided into blocks, and each block can have its own Language set (e.g. JavaScript, JSON, Markdown, etc.). This gives you syntax highlighting and lets you auto-format that JSON response.
  Available for Mac, Windows, and Linux.
ReleaseNotes: |-
  Improved support for folding blocks
  - Fixed an issue where some types of blocks could not be folded.
  - The fold state is now stored in the buffer file so that it's persisted between sessions.
  - Added three new commands for folding and unfolding blocks:
    - foldBlock - Folds the current/selected block(s). Default key binding is Ctrl-Alt-[ on Windows/Linux and Cmd-Option-[ on Mac.
    - unfoldBlock - Unfolds the current/selected block(s). Default key binding is Ctrl-Alt-] on Windows/Linux and Cmd-Option-] on Mac.
    - toggleFoldBlock - Toggles the fold state of the current/selected block. Default key binding is Ctrl-Alt-. on Windows/Linux and Cmd-Option-. on Mac.
  - Folded blocks now display the first 50 characters of the block content, as well as the number of lines in the block.
  - Default key bindings for folding code on Mac changed from Cmd-Option-[ and Cmd-Option-] to Cmd-Shift-[ and Cmd-Shift-] (to avoid conflicts with the new block folding commands)
  Other features and fixes
  - Add document navigation commands (Ctrl+Home/End)
  - Fix wrong positioning if IME interface (for Chinese input)
  - Prevent editor from loosing focus when line number/fold gutter is clicked
