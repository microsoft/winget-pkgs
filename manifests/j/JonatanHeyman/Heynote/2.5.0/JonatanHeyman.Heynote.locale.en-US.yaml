ShortDescription: A dedicated scratchpad for developers
Description: |-
  Heynote is a dedicated scratchpad for developers. It functions as a large persistent text buffer where you can write down anything you like. Works great for that Slack message you don't want to accidentally send, a JSON response from an API you're working with, notes from a meeting, your daily to-do list, etc.
  The Heynote buffer is divided into blocks, and each block can have its own Language set (e.g. JavaScript, JSON, Markdown, etc.). This gives you syntax highlighting and lets you auto-format that JSON response.
  Available for Mac, Windows, and Linux.
ReleaseNotes: |-
  What's New
  Tabs
  You now get a visual representation of open buffers in the form of tabs. The tabs are integrated in the menu bar to take up as little screen real estate as possible, and they can also be turned off - completely or just in fullscreen mode - in the settings.
  Spellchecking
  It's now possible to turn on/off spellchecking. This can be done by clicking the spellchecking icon in the status bar. There are also heynote commands that can be bound to custom keys to enable/disable/toggle spellchecking.
  Other fixes and improvements
  - Added a pin icon to the status bar that can be used to toggle the "Always on top" setting (to make the windows float on top of other programs).
  - Added toggleAlwaysOnTop command that can be used to bind a key that toggles the "Always on top setting".
  - Remember the open buffer(s) between program restarts.
  - Fixed so that Alt-clicking on an cursor removes it (if more than one cursor exists).
  - Changed the key binding for rectangular selection from Alt+Click to Alt+Shift+Click.
  - Fixed issue where the window position wouldn't be properly restored in some cases.
  - Updated to latest version of Electron.
