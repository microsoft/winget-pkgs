ShortDescription: Improved version of the original JS8Call software for JS8 digital mode weak signal keyboard-to-keyboard messaging for ham radio.
ReleaseNotes: |-
  Carefully read the release notes below for your operating system, and review the Known Issues, before installing JS8Call 2.5.0.
  Installer Notes
  - On all platforms 5363 kHz has been added to the frequency list for the new 60m band segment when it becomes available for use. The 160m frequency has been moved to 1843.5kHz to reduce interference from FT8 operations on 1840kHz. To reset your frequency list, go to Settings → Frequencies, right click and select Reset to add the new frequencies to the list. If you have custom frequencies you want to save, export those from the list first then merge them after the Reset.
  - The JS8Call-improved 2.4.0 release was a transition release from development moving to the JS8Call-improved development team. Jordan is now on the JS8Call-improved team and has requested re-naming of the software back to JS8Call, so this change is made for 2.5.0
  MacOS
  MacOS builds are universal (both Intel and Apple silicon) and arm64 (Apple silicon only). The Apple silicon build is recommended for M-series Macs as it is more optimized for Apple silicon. The universal build is provided to support older Intel Macs, however it will also run fine on M-series Macs. The app is signed and notarized. The Mac builds were done on MacOS 26 Tahoe with Xcode 26.0.1 (17A400). MacOS 12 Monterey and later are supported. For Mac users, be aware that Apple is deprecating Intel Macs after MacOS 26 and while it is not known at this time if universal builds will still be available with Xcode 27, MacOS 26 is the last version that will support the last Macs built with Intel processors. We will continue to support older Intel Macs as long as possible, and while JS8Call will still run on a late-2014 Mac mini running Monterey, the next year might be a good time to consider upgrading to a M-series Mac.
  Linux
  Linux is now distributed via AppImage only. If you wish to build JS8Call on linux there are semi-automated build scripts available in the source tree at https://github.com/JS8Call-improved/JS8Call-improved/tree/master/tools . While these are now primarily intended for developer use, end-users can use and modify them to build JS8Call on linux, however, they are no longer being included in the release assets.
  Windows 11
  Windows 11 build is provided for x86_64 only. It will run on arm64 Windows 11 with the prism emulator. This has been tested on arm64 Windows 11 and there was no issues noted. OmniRig is no longer supported since v2.4.0. It is a deprecated 32-bit program and Windows 11 is 64-bit only.
  The Windows build is code signed by the JS8Call Developer team. Windows Defender and various virus scanning programs do not universally recognize signed software on Windows 11. If your Windows anti-virus software complains about it, make an exception in the rules for JS8Call. The digital code signature guarantees the software is malware-free, done on our official build system, and it ensures that it can't be tampered with during distribution of the software. Even so, the various virus scanners on Windows produce a lot of false positives. But the entire build chain is open-source, available for anybody to scrutinize, so you can be assured there is no malware or "trojan" mysteriously embedded in the software. The digital signature allows you to verify it came from a trusted source, even though virus scanners may not think so. DO NOT download a Windows build anywhere but from our GitHub official repository.
  JS8Call will also still run on Windows 10.
  Known Issues
  - There is incompatibility in settings between JS8Call v2.2.x and 2.3 and later. Settings between all versions of JS8Call are compatible from v2.3 on and can read the settings from JS8Call 2.2.x. JS8Call 2.2.x is not compatible with the settings created by JS8Call 2.3 and later.
  - Enumeration of audio interfaces is different in JS8Call 2.3 and later, and it will only return a list of valid auto interfaces, not a list of possibilities that you can try until one works. There is also some issues with text encoding that you may notice in the message window if you try to revert to JS8Call 2.2. Although JS8Call v2.2.0 is no longer supported, if you are still using this version and wish to save your settings from it, make a copy of your JS8Call.ini configuration file before installing and running JS8Call-improved.
  The JS8Call.ini file is found at:
  Linux: ~/.config/JS8Call.ini
  Windows, in C:\Users<your_user_ID>\AppData\Local\JS8Call directory
  Mac, ~/Library/Preferences/JS8Call.ini
  - JS8Call uses the Qt 6.9.3 FFmpeg audio back end. On linux this requires either PulseAudio or PipeWire. ALSA audio has been deprecated by Qt. Some distributions like Debian install an ALSA-PipeWire plugin, which in testing has worked fine with JS8Call-improved
  - Delay in PTT on some linux systems have been reported when using Flrig. This has been determined to be an issue with the TCP (XML over HTTP) connection between Hamlib and Flrig. It only affects a small number of linux systems, most notably Mint 22. If you experience this issue, discontinue use of Flrig and going direct from JS8Call to the radio will fix it.
  - If you find a bug or issue with JS8Call please post complete information on the issue to the GitHub repo at https://github.com/JS8Call-improved/JS8Call-improved/issues or in the Discussions category.
