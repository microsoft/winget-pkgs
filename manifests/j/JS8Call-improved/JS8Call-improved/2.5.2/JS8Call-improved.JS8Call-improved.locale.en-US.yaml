ShortDescription: Improved version of the original JS8Call software for JS8 digital mode weak signal keyboard-to-keyboard messaging for ham radio.
ReleaseNotes: |-
  This is a patch release that changes the priority of auto-replies to directed commands. It gives auto-replies to certain commands (SNR?, HEARING? INFO?, GRID?, STATUS?, QUERY MSGS and QUERY CALL) higher priority than messaging. If messaging activity is detected in the passband, since ver 2.4.0 auto-replies to these commands have been suppressed until the band is clear.
  Messaging still has priority over auto heartbeat ACK. So if there is incoming MSG's in the band activity, auto HB ACK will be suppressed until messaging is complete to prevent HB ACK auto-reply from breaking incoming MSG's or directed communications.
  This change was made based on user feedback wanting higher priority for the automated features over messaging. If you do not want your station auto-replying to these commands when messaging is taking place, you must now disable auto-replies in the Settings.
  Please read the rest of the release notes for the 2.5.0 release before installing.
