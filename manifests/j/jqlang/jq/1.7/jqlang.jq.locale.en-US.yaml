  - Respect NO_COLOR environment variable to disable color output.
    See <https://no-color.org> for details. @itchyny #2728
  - Improved --help output.
    Now mentions all options and nicer order. @itchyny @wader #2747 #2766 #2799
  - Fix multiple issues of exit code using --exit-code/-e option. @ryo1kato #1697
  - Add --binary/-b on Windows for binary output.
    To get \n instead of \r\n line endings. @nicowilliams 0dab2b1
  - Add --raw-output0 for NUL (zero byte) separated output. @asottile @pabs3 @itchyny #1990 #2235 #2684
  - Fix assert crash and validate JSON for --jsonarg. @wader #2658
  - Remove deprecated --argfile option. @itchyny #2768

  Language changes
  - Use decimal number literals to preserve precision.
    Comparison operations respects precision but arithmetic operations might truncate. @leonid-s-usov #1752
  - Adds new builtin pick(stream) to emit a projection of the input object or array. @pkoppstein #2656 #2779
  - Adds new builtin debug(msgs) that works like debug but applies a filter on the input before writing to stderr. @pkoppstein #2710
  - Adds new builtin scan($re; $flags).
    Was documented but not implemented. @itchyny #1961
  - Adds new builtin abs to get absolute value.
    This potentially allows the literal value of numbers to be preserved as length and fabs convert to float. @pkoppstein #2767
  - Allow if without else-branch.
    When skipped the else-branch will be . (identity). @chancez @wader #1825 #2481
  - Allow use of $binding as key in object literals. @nicowilliams 8ea4a55

  - Fix try/catch catches more than it should. @nicowilliams #2750
  - Speed up and refactor some builtins, also remove scalars_or_empty/0. @muhmuhten #1845
  - Now halt and halt_error exit immediately instead of continuing to the next input. @emanuele6 #2667
  - Fix issue converting string to number after previous convert error. @thalman #2400
  - Fix issue representing large numbers on some platforms causing invalid JSON output. @itchyny #2661
