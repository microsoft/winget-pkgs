ReleaseNotes: |-
  As always, make backups of your save data (save.json and notes folder) before updating and regularly.
  General
  - Updated to Electron 32 and Node.js 20
  - Added Russian localization (@wennerryle) #85
  - Updated MathLive to 0.104
    - This adds a new menu in the Math Editor to insert common math expressions easily, like a matrix.
  Bug Fixes
  - Fixed an issue where favoriting / unfavoriting pages doesn't work.
  - Fixed an issue where the textContent of notes was not being saved, which is what the search bar uses to find text.
    - If the search bar is not correctly finding text in your notes, you might need to go through your pages manually and re-save them to generate each page's text content for searching.

  Codex v3 (a full rewrite) is something that I would like to do soon, with a new website and docs. Currently waiting on TipTap v3 before I start again. Take the new survey for suggestions and input.
  As always, bug reports and issues go in the Issues.
