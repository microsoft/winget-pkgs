  # PathOptions
  This release introduces PathOptions, a powerful new feature that enables precise control over how different parts of your JSON/YAML data are compared. PathOptions allow you to apply different comparison semantics to specific paths within your data structures, giving you fine-grained control over diff behavior.

  Key Features:
  - Targeted comparison options: Apply SET, MULTISET, precision, or setkeys options to specific paths using the syntax `{"@":["path","to","target"],"^":[options]}`
  - Path isolation: Options only affect their specified paths and don't leak globally, allowing you to mix different comparison semantics in the same diff
  - Enhanced array dispatch: Fixed critical bug where PathOptions with empty paths (root level) weren't being applied correctly for array dispatch
  - Comprehensive documentation: Complete v2 Diff Language guide with new EBNF grammar, PathOption integration examples, and updated CLI help showing flag equivalents
  - Extensive test coverage: Added 24 test cases demonstrating PathOption functionality across various data structures and edge cases

  Examples:
  ### Apply SET semantics to specific array while others remain lists:

  jd -opts='[{"@":["tags"],"^":["SET"]}]' a.json b.json

  ### Multiple PathOptions with different semantics

  jd -opts='[{"@":["items"],"^":["SET"]}, {"@":["price"],"^":[{"precision":0.01}]}]' a.json b.json

  This release maintains full backward compatibility while adding powerful new capabilities for sophisticated diff control scenarios.
