ShortDescription: Inspect and unpack InnoSetup archives
Description: InnoUnpacker is a graphical user interface (GUI) for innounp that makes the usage more comfortable. The executable setup to be processed can be loaded via a file selection dialog, just by drag & drop, using the command line or by an entry in the Windows context menu for exe files. Immediately after opening, the basic file info and the list of included files are displayed. To extract files, just click the appropriate button and select the destination directory. Optionally, a filter can be specified to extract only the matching files.
