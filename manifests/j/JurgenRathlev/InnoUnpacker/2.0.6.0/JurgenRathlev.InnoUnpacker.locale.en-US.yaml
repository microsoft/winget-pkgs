ShortDescription: Inspect and unpack InnoSetup archives
Description: |-
  InnoUnpacker is a graphical user interface (GUI) for these console applications that makes the usage more comfortable.
  The executable setup to be processed can be loaded via a file selection dialog, just by drag & drop, using the command line or by an entry in the Windows context menu for exe files.
  Immediately after opening, the basic file info of the setup is displayed.

  All other functions are activated by clicking on one of the buttons:
  - General information about the setup
  - A list of all included files
  - All supported languages
  - Verify setup file
  - Start file extraction
  - Select destination directory for extracted files
  - Optionally, you can specify whether only the installation script or the files matching a filter are to be extracted.
