ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Added a new environment variable $FZF_POS exported to the child processes.
    It's the vertical position of the cursor in the list starting from 1.
  - Added --with-shell option to start child processes with a custom shell command and flags
  - Added change-multi action for dynamically changing --multi option
  - change-multi - enable multi-select mode with no limit
  - change-multi(NUM) - enable multi-select mode with a limit
  - change-multi(0) - disable multi-select mode
  - Windows improvements
  - become action is now supported on Windows
  - Unlike in *nix, this does not use execve(2).
    Instead it spawns a new process and waits for it to finish, so the exact behavior may differ.
  - Fixed argument escaping for Windows cmd.exe.
    No redundant escaping of backslashes.
  - Bug fixes and improvements
