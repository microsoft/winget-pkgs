ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Replaced ["the default find command"][find] with a built-in directory traversal to simplify the code and to achieve better performance and consistent behavior across platforms.
  - Breaking changes:
  - Unlike [the previous "find" command][find], the new traversal code will list hidden files, but hidden directories will still be ignored
  - No filtering of devtmpfs or proc types
  - Traversal is parallelized, so the order of the entries will be different each time
  - You would wonder why fzf implements directory traversal anyway when it's a filter program following the Unix philosophy.
  - Built-in traversal is now done using the excellent [charlievieth/fastwalk][fastwalk] library, which easily outperforms its competitors and supports safely following symlinks.
  - Added $FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS_FILE to allow managing default options in a file
  - See #3618
  - Option precedence from lower to higher
  - Bug fixes and improvements
