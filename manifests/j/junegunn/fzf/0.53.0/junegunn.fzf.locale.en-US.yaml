ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Multi-line display
  - See Processing multi-line items
  - fzf can now display multi-line items
  - To disable multi-line display, use --no-multi-line
  - CTRL-R bindings of bash, zsh, and fish have been updated to leverage multi-line display
  - The default --pointer and --marker have been changed from > to Unicode bar characters as they look better with multi-line items
  - Added --marker-multi-line to customize the select marker for multi-line entries with the default set to ╻┃╹
  - Native tmux integration
  - Added --tmux option to replace fzf-tmux script and simplify distribution
  - To keep the implementation simple, it only uses popups.
    You need tmux 3.3 or later.
  - To use --tmux in Vim plugin:
  - Added support for endless input streams
  - See Browsing log stream with fzf
  - Added --tail=NUM option to limit the number of items to keep in memory.
    This is useful when you want to browse an endless stream of data (e.g. log stream) with fzf while limiting memory usage.
  - Better Windows Support
  - fzf now works on Git bash (mintty) out of the box via winpty integration
  - Many fixes and improvements for Windows
  - man page is now embedded in the binary; fzf --man to see it
  - Changed the default --scroll-off to 3, as we think it's a better default
  - Process started by execute action now directly writes to and reads from /dev/tty.
    Manual /dev/tty redirection for interactive programs is no longer required.
  - Added print(...) action to queue an arbitrary string to be printed on exit.
    This was mainly added to work around the limitation of --expect where it's not compatible with --bind on the same key and it would ignore other actions bound to it.
  - We also considered making them compatible, but realized that some users may have been relying on the current behavior.
  - NO_COLOR environment variable is now respected. If the variable is set, fzf defaults to --no-color unless otherwise specified.
