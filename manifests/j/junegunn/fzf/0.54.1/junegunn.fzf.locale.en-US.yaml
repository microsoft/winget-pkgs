ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Updated fastwalk dependency for built-in directory walker
  - fastwalk: add optional sorting and improve documentation
  - fastwalk: only check if MSYSTEM is set during MSYS/MSYS2
  - Thanks to @charlievieth
  - Reverted ALT-C binding of fish to use cd instead of builtin cd
  - builtin cd was introduced to work around a bug of cd coming from zoxide init --cmd cd fish where it cannot handle -- argument.
  - However, the default cd of fish is actually a wrapper function for supporting cd -, so we want to use it instead.
  - See #3928 for more information and consider helping zoxide fix the bug.
