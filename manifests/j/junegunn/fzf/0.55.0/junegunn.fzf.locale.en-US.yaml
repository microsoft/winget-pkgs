ShortDescription: A general-purpose command-line fuzzy finder
Tags:

ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Added exact-boundary-match type to the search syntax.
    When a search term is single-quoted, fzf will search for the exact occurrences of the string with both ends at word boundaries.
  - [bash] Fuzzy path completion is enabled for all commands
  - 1. If the default completion is not already set
  - 2. And if the current bash supports complete -D option
  - However, fuzzy completion for some commands can be "dynamically" disabled by the dynamic completion loader
  - See the comment in __fzf_default_completion function for more information
  - Comments are now allowed in $FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS and $FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS_FILE
  - Hyperlinks (OSC 8) are now supported in the preview window and in the main window
  - The default --ellipsis is now ·· instead of ...
  - [vim] A spec can have exit callback that is called with the exit status of fzf
  - This can be used to clean up temporary resources or restore the original state when fzf is closed without a selection
  - Fixed --tmux bottom when the status line is not at the bottom
  - Fixed extra scroll offset in multi-line mode (--read0 or --wrap)
  - Added fallback ps command for kill completion on Cygwin
