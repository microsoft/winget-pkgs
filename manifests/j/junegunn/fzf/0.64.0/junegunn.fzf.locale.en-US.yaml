ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Added multi event that is triggered when the multi-selection has changed.
    fzf --multi \
        --bind 'ctrl-a:select-all,ctrl-d:deselect-all' \
        --bind 'multi:transform-footer:(( FZF_SELECT_COUNT )) && echo "Selected $FZF_SELECT_COUNT item(s)"'
  - Halfwidth and fullwidth alphanumeric and punctuation characters are now internally normalized to their ASCII equivalents to allow matching with ASCII queries.
    echo ＡＢＣ| fzf -q abc
  - Renamed clear-selection action to clear-multi for consistency.
    - clear-selection remains supported as an alias for backward compatibility.
  - Bug fixes
    - Fixed a bug that could cause fzf to abort due to incorrect update ordering.
    - Fixed a bug where some multi-selections were lost when using exclude or change-nth.
