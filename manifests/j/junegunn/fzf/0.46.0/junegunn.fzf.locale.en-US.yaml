ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Added two new events
  - result - triggered when the filtering for the current query is complete and the result list is ready
  - resize - triggered when the terminal size is changed
  - fzf now exports the following environment variables to the child processes
  - This allows you to write sophisticated transformations like so
  - And we're phasing out {fzf:prompt} and {fzf:action}
  - Changed mattn/go-runewidth dependency to rivo/uniseg for accurate results
  - Set --ambidouble if your terminal displays ambiguous width characters (e.g. box-drawing characters for borders) as 2 columns
  - RUNEWIDTH_EASTASIAN=1 is still respected for backward compatibility, but it's recommended that you use this new option instead
  - Bug fixes
