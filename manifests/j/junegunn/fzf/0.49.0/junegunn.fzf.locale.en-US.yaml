ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Ingestion performance improved by around 40% (more or less depending on options)
  - --info=hidden and --info=inline-right will no longer hide the horizontal separator by default. This gives you more flexibility in customizing the layout.
  - Added two environment variables exported to the child processes
  - FZF_PREVIEW_LABEL
  - FZF_BORDER_LABEL
  - Renamed track action to track-current to highlight the difference between the global tracking state set by --track and a one-off tracking action
  - track is still available as an alias
  - Added untrack-current and toggle-track-current actions
  - *-current actions are no-op when the global tracking state is set
  - Bug fixes and minor improvements
