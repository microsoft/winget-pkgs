ReleaseNotes: |-
  This release focuses on performance improvements and fixing several edge cases that affected users with complex configurations. The headline changes include significant startup time reduction for mise x (exec) and a new consolidated manifest system that replaces the per-tool .mise.backend files, making tool installations cleaner and faster.
  Configuration management gets more flexible with support for loading .config/miserc.toml in local directories, and the prepare providers are now properly scoped to their defining config files—fixing issues where providers could leak between projects.
  Highlights
  - Faster mise x startup - Reduced overhead when running commands through mise x, which should be noticeable for frequently executed commands (#7890)
  - Consolidated backend manifest - Tool installations now use a single manifest file instead of individual .mise.backend files per tool, improving both performance and disk organization (#7892)
  - Local .config/miserc.toml support - You can now place mise configuration in .config/miserc.toml within your project directory, following XDG conventions (#7896) - thanks @scop!
  Bug Fixes
  - Scoped prepare providers - Prepare providers are now correctly scoped to their defining config file, preventing unintended interactions between projects (#7889)
  - GitHub cache path fix - Resolved an issue where clearing cache for GitHub backend tools used incorrect paths (#7907)
  - macOS .app bundle support - The GitHub backend now properly discovers binaries inside macOS .app bundles (#7885)
  - Task --help behavior - Running mise run <task> --help now shows task info instead of trying to execute when no usage spec is defined (#7893)
  - Task wait_for fixes - Fixed issues with wait_for when using environment overrides, and outputs are now properly re-rendered (#7888)
  vfox Improvements
  - Module hooks now receive the constructed environment when using cmd.exec, enabling more powerful plugin behavior (#7908)
  Documentation
  - Added documentation explaining MISE_GITLAB_TOKEN for accessing private GitLab repositories - thanks @lchagnoleau! (#7902)
