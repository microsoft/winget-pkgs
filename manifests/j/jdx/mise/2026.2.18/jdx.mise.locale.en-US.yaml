Moniker: mise
ReleaseNotes: |-
  A bug-fix-heavy release focused on task execution reliability, with a new feature for cross-platform tool locking.
  Highlights
  - Auto-lock all platforms after install — When you install a tool, mise now automatically locks versions for all platforms (not just the current one). This means your mise.lock stays complete for teammates on different OSes without needing to run mise lock separately. #8277
  - Process group cleanup for tasks — Task child processes are now managed via Unix process groups, so killing a task reliably takes down the entire process tree instead of leaving orphaned children. #8279
  - depends_post tasks run even on failure — Post-dependency tasks (cleanup, notifications, etc.) now execute even when the parent task fails, matching the expected behavior for teardown-style hooks. #8274
  Bug Fixes
  - Infinite shim recursion on Unix — mise exec now strips its own shims from PATH before spawning subprocesses, preventing infinite recursion when a shimmed tool calls itself. #8276
  - --yes flag now works for config trust prompts — The --yes/-y flag is now properly respected when mise prompts to trust a config file. #8288
  - --locked --dry-run validation order — mise install --locked now validates the lock requirement before the --dry-run short-circuit, so you get a proper error instead of silent success. #8290 by @altendky
  - JSON Schema compatibility — Replaced unevaluatedProperties with additionalProperties in the mise JSON schema for broader validator support. #8285
  - Duplicate stderr on task failure — Fixed tasks in replacing output mode printing error output twice on failure. #8275
  - Did-you-mean for task commands — Mistyping a CLI subcommand now suggests similar task names. #8286
  - Monorepo prepare steps — Prepare steps for subdirectory configs now execute from the repository root as expected. #8291
  - mise upgrade no longer force-reinstalls — Previously installed versions are skipped during upgrade instead of being redundantly reinstalled. #8282
  - Terminal restore after mise watch — watchexec no longer leaves the terminal in a broken state on exit. #8273
  Documentation
  - Clarified that MISE_CEILING_PATHS excludes the ceiling directory itself. #8283
