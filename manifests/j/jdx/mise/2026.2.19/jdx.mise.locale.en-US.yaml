ReleaseNotes: |-
  A small patch release with two targeted bug fixes: a regression fix for interactive task execution and better cleanup after failed installs.
  Bug Fixes
  - Interactive tasks no longer hang -- The process group isolation added in v2026.2.18 (#8279) inadvertently broke interactive tools like Tilt that read from stdin. When a child process was moved to its own process group, the terminal wouldn't deliver keyboard input to it, causing SIGTTIN and a silent hang. mise now checks whether stdin is a TTY before calling setpgid -- interactive tasks stay in the terminal's foreground process group for proper keyboard I/O, while non-interactive tasks still get their own process group for clean signal teardown. #8301 by @jdx
  - Failed installs clean up properly -- When an install fails (e.g. a 404 for a non-existent version or a 403 from GitHub rate limiting), mise now removes the empty parent directory (e.g. installs/tilt/) and the stale incomplete marker from cache, instead of leaving them behind. #8302 by @jdx
  Documentation
  - Fixed the ripgrep command in the getting-started guide to use the correct binary name rg instead of ripgrep. #8299 by @nguyenvulong
