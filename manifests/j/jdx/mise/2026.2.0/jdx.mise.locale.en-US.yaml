ReleaseNotes: |-
  This release marks a significant milestone: lockfiles are now stable and no longer require an experimental flag. After extensive testing and refinement, lockfiles are ready for production use, giving you reproducible builds with cryptographically verified tool versions across your team.
  The other headline feature is mise edit, a brand new interactive configuration editor that makes managing your mise setup more intuitive than ever. Just run mise edit and navigate your configuration with a proper editor interface.
  Highlights
  - Lockfiles are stable — No more MISE_EXPERIMENTAL=1 needed! Lockfiles ensure everyone on your team gets exactly the same tool versions with SHA256 verification. See the lockfile documentation for details. #7929
  - Interactive config editor — The new mise edit command launches an interactive editor for your mise configuration, making it easier to manage tools and settings. #7930
  - Smarter task confirmation dialogs — Task confirm prompts now support usage values, giving you more context when confirming task execution. Thanks @roele! #7924
  - Windows shebang task support — File tasks with shebangs are now properly discovered and executed on Windows. #7941
  Performance
  - Faster dependency scheduling — Tool installation now uses Kahn's algorithm for optimal parallel dependency resolution, speeding up installs with complex dependency trees. #7933
  - Efficient secret redaction — Switched to Aho-Corasick algorithm for redacting secrets in output, improving performance when many secrets are configured. #7931
  Bug Fixes
  - PATH ordering preserved — Fixed an issue where paths added after mise activate could get reordered unexpectedly. #7919
  - Lockfile reliability — Atomic writes prevent corruption, cache invalidation works correctly, and URL/SHA256 info is properly preserved when merging platform information. #7923, #7927
  - Template hash filter — The hash filter in templates now uses SHA256 instead of Blake3 for broader compatibility. #7925
  - Smarter version pruning — mise upgrade now respects tracked configs when pruning old versions, preventing accidental removal of versions still in use. #7926
  - Deterministic error output — Failed installations are now sorted, making error messages consistent across runs. #7936
  Documentation
  - Improved clarity on uvx and pipx dependencies — Thanks @ygormutti for your first contribution! #7878
