ReleaseNotes: |-
  A feature-packed release that replaces the conda backend with production-grade internals, adds a native .NET SDK plugin, and finally enforces per-task timeouts. Several lockfile and environment-handling fixes round things out.
  Highlights
  - Conda backend rewritten with rattler -- The experimental conda backend has been completely rewritten to use the rattler Rust crates (the same engine behind pixi), replacing ~1,600 lines of custom code that relied on the unsupported anaconda.org API. This brings a proper SAT-based dependency solver, correct binary prefix replacement, and repodata caching via CDN. #8325 by @jdx
  - Native .NET SDK management -- A new core plugin for .NET SDK installs all versions side-by-side under a shared DOTNET_ROOT, matching .NET's native multi-version model. It uses Microsoft's official dotnet-install script and supports global.json for per-project SDK pinning. #8326 by @jdx
  - Per-task timeouts are now enforced -- The timeout field on tasks (added in v2025.1.6 but never wired up) now actually kills tasks that exceed their limit. Timeouts send SIGTERM with a 5-second grace period before SIGKILL, and both per-task and global task_timeout settings are respected. #8250 by @tvararu
  Added
  - Core .NET SDK plugin -- mise use dotnet@8 now installs via a native core plugin with side-by-side version support and global.json detection. Configure DOTNET_ROOT via the new dotnet.dotnet_root setting. #8326 by @jdx
  - Per-task timeout enforcement -- Tasks with a timeout field are now killed if they exceed the configured duration. Works with both per-task config and the global task_timeout/--timeout flag. #8250 by @tvararu
    [tasks.deploy]
    run = "npm run deploy"
    timeout = "5m"
  - VSIX archive support -- The HTTP backend now recognizes .vsix files as ZIP archives and extracts them correctly, enabling tools distributed as VS Code extensions to be installed via http: URLs. #8306 by @sosumappu
  - Registry: oxfmt -- Added the oxfmt formatter to the tool registry. #8316 by @taoufik07
  Changed
  - Conda backend rewritten with rattler crates -- Replaces custom version matching, dependency resolution, archive extraction, and binary patching with the battle-tested rattler ecosystem (rattler_solve, rattler_repodata_gateway, rattler::install). Binary prefix replacement now works correctly (the old code skipped binary files entirely). Since the conda backend is still experimental, this is a non-breaking change. #8325 by @jdx
  Fixed
  - Lockfile not modified with --locked -- mise install --locked no longer writes to mise.lock, matching the semantics of cargo install --locked and uv pip install --locked. #8308 by @jdx
  - Orphan lockfile entries pruned -- mise lock now removes stale tool entries that are no longer present in config, keeping the lockfile aligned with the current toolset. #8265 by @mackwic
  - Contradictory lockfile config caught early -- Setting locked=true alongside lockfile=false now produces a clear error instead of silently ignoring the lock. #8329 by @jdx
  - watch_files triggers on every change -- The hook-env fast-path now checks [[watch_files]] paths, fixing a bug where only the first file change triggered the associated run command. #8317 by @jdx
  - Fish alias completions cleaned up -- Setting or unsetting shell aliases in fish now clears stale completions, preventing tab-complete from offering outdated suggestions. #8324 by @jdx
  - JSON schema accepts age-encrypted env values -- Fixed a oneOf ambiguity in the mise schema that rejected [env] entries using age encryption. #8328 by @adamliang0
  - Regal registry updated -- The regal tool now points to its new home at open-policy-agent/regal. #8315 by @charlieegan3
  - Conda: locked installs preserve package data -- conda_packages entries are no longer silently dropped during --locked installs, and concurrent downloads no longer race on the same temp file. #8335 by @jdx
  - Conda: solver no longer fails on Linux -- Deduplicated repodata records before passing them to the solver, fixing "duplicate records" errors when installing tools like imagemagick. #8337 by @jdx
