ReleaseNotes: |-
  This release focuses on stability improvements and compatibility fixes. The headline fix addresses a caching issue where plugin watch files weren't being properly cached, causing unnecessary re-execution of plugins when loading environment variables. We've also resolved several edge cases in tool resolution and version handling.
  Bug Fixes
  - Registry mismatch fix: Previously installed tools now correctly resolve against the registry, fixing cases where tools installed before registry changes would fail to match properly. Thanks to @smorimoto for this fix in their first contribution! #7773
  - Environment caching improvement: Fixed an issue where watch_files weren't being cached properly, causing plugins to re-execute unnecessarily when loading environment variables. This should improve performance when using plugins with file watchers. #7817
  - GitHub tag format handling: The GitHub backend now correctly handles tools that use the projectname@version tag format (e.g., tool@v1.2.3), expanding compatibility with more GitHub releases. #7788
  - HashiCorp tools version detection: Added fromJSON and keys functions to version_expr for the HTTP backend, fixing version detection for HashiCorp tools like sentinel, nomad-pack, and tfc-agent. #7816
  Registry Additions
  - claude-powerline: A powerline prompt theme - added by @TyceHerrman #7798
  - rpk: Redpanda CLI tool - added by @artemklevtsov #7802
