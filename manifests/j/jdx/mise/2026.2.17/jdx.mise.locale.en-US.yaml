Moniker: mise
ReleaseNotes: |-
  A moderate release with a handful of bug fixes and a new feature for the prepare system.
  Highlights
  - Prepare: auto-touch stale outputs — When tools like uv sync skip work because dependencies are already satisfied, output files don't get updated, causing mise to consider them stale on the next run. Prepare providers now automatically touch output files after a successful command, keeping staleness checks accurate. This is controlled by a new touch_outputs config option (defaults to true). #8243 by @halms
  - Settings reorganization: task_* → task.* — Nine flat task_* settings have been consolidated into a nested task.* namespace (e.g., task_output → task.output). The old names still work with no breaking changes — deprecation warnings won't appear until 2026.8.0. #8239
  Bug Fixes
  - Postinstall hooks now use correct bin paths — Per-tool postinstall hooks were hardcoding $install_path/bin on PATH, which broke backends like aqua where binaries live in non-standard subdirectories. Hooks now use each backend's actual binary paths. #8234
  - mise use writes to the correct config file — When both config.toml and config.local.toml exist, mise use was incorrectly writing to config.local.toml. It now properly targets config.toml. #8240
  - Legacy .mise.backend installs no longer block auto-migration — Legacy backend files were defaulting to explicit_backend = true, which prevented auto-migration to updated registry backends. They now default to non-explicit, allowing tools like glab to resolve correctly through the current registry. #8245 by @jean-humann
