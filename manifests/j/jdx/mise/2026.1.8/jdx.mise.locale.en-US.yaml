ShortDescription: Dev tools, env vars, tasks
Moniker: mise
ReleaseNotes: |-
  This release brings a significant architectural improvement to mise's registry system, splitting the monolithic registry.toml into individual files per tool. This refactoring makes the registry more maintainable and easier to contribute to. We've also squashed several bugs across the aqua backend, GitHub release handling, and task system.
  Highlights
  - Registry restructured: The tool registry has been split from a single large file into one file per tool (#7820). This makes it much easier to add new tools and review registry changes.
  - Claude now uses aqua backend: The Claude CLI tool now defaults to the aqua backend for installation (#7842).
  Bug Fixes
  - Aqua backend improvements: Fixed an issue where the lockfile wasn't being invalidated when assets didn't match the registry (#7830). Added helpful warnings when version tag lookups fail (#7831).
  - GitHub backend: Windows-specific file extensions (like .exe and .zip) are now properly deprioritized when selecting release assets on non-Windows platforms (#7838). This prevents accidentally downloading Windows binaries on Linux/macOS.
  - Task system fixes: Environment variables in monorepo task usage specs now resolve correctly (#7832). File task headers now support dotted keys and deep-merge behavior (#7840), giving you more flexibility in task configuration.
  - mise ls --local fix: Idiomatic version files (like .node-version) and .tool-versions files now properly appear in mise ls --local output (#7836). Thanks to @offbyone for this fix!
