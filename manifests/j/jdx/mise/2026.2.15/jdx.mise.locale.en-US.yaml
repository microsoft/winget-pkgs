ReleaseNotes: |-
  This release brings a nice quality-of-life improvement to task execution along with a solid batch of bug fixes across several subsystems.
  Highlights
  - Real-time streaming for keep-order tasks — The keep_order task output mode now streams the active task's output in real-time instead of buffering everything until completion. Other parallel tasks buffer quietly and flush in definition order as they finish, so you get live feedback without sacrificing deterministic output ordering. #8164
  - npm backend performance — npm view is now called only once per package lookup instead of multiple times, speeding up npm-based tool resolution. Thanks @risu729! #8181
  Bug Fixes
  - Recursive shim execution on Windows — mise exec now strips the shims directory from PATH during executable lookup, preventing infinite recursion when shims call back into mise x. #8189
  - PATH reordering after activation — hook-env now preserves any PATH reordering done after mise activate (e.g., by ~/.zlogin), instead of silently reverting to the original order. #8190
  - Cross-platform lockfile resolution — The aqua backend now correctly resolves lockfile artifacts for the target platform instead of leaking host-specific overrides into mise lock --platform. Thanks @mackwic! #8183
  - Version alias lockfile lookup — Version aliases (like lts) are now resolved before lockfile lookup, so locked versions are matched correctly. #8194
  - Task source freshness checks — Freshness checks now work correctly with dynamic task directories. Thanks @rooperuu! #8169
  - Global tasks in monorepos — Global tasks are now properly resolved when running from a monorepo root. #8192
  - Wildcard glob matching — test:* no longer incorrectly matches the parent test task. #8165
  - task_config.includes paths — Include paths in task config are now resolved relative to the config root, not the working directory. #8193
  - Upgrade safety — mise upgrade now skips untrusted tracked configs instead of failing. #8195
  - helm-diff registry entry — Fixed the archive binary name for helm-diff. Thanks @jean-humann! #8173
