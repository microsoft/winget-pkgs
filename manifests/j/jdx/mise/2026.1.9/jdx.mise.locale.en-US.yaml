ReleaseNotes: |-
  This release introduces task templates, a powerful new feature for creating reusable task definitions across your projects. Combined with glob pattern support for task includes and automatic plugin installation, mise is becoming even more flexible for complex project setups. We've also added several quality-of-life improvements including better diagnostics from mise doctor and enhanced archive extraction capabilities.
  Highlights
  Task Templates (#7873) - Define reusable task templates that can be instantiated with different parameters. This is perfect for monorepos or projects with repetitive task patterns. See the tasks documentation for details.
  Glob Patterns in Task Includes (#7870) - You can now use glob patterns like tasks/**/*.toml in your task_config.includes setting, making it easier to organize tasks across multiple files.
  Auto-install Plugins (#7856) - Plugins defined in your [plugins] config section are now automatically installed when needed, reducing setup friction for new team members.
  Backend Mismatch Warnings (#7847) - mise doctor now warns you when a tool is installed via a different backend than what's currently configured, helping diagnose unexpected behavior.
  Archive Extraction Improvements (#7874) - Added rename_exe support for archive extraction, giving backend authors more control over how executables are named after extraction.
  Bug Fixes
  - GitHub backend: Fixed SLSA verification to select the correct platform-matching provenance file (#7853)
  - Go: Filtered out invalid version "1" from available versions list (#7871)
  - Flutter: Fixed duplicate -stable suffix in download URLs (#7872)
  - pipx: Ensured Python minor version symlink exists for postinstall hooks (#7869)
  - Tasks: Fixed environment variable passing to usage parser (#7848) and proper MISE_ENV propagation with -E flag
  - Archive extraction: Fixed handling of archives with ./ prefixed paths (#7868)
  - vfox-dotnet: Fixed Windows installation issues (#7843) - thanks @prodrigues1912!
  Reverted
  - Task inheritance from parent configs in monorepos has been reverted (#7851) pending further refinement
  Registry
  - Added vercel (#7844) - thanks @mikecurtis!
  - Added mago (#7845) - thanks @scop!
