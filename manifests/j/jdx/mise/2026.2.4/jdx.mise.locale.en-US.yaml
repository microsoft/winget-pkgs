ReleaseNotes: |-
  This release focuses on fixing several edge cases in environment handling and tool management. Users working with complex environment configurations, npm package managers, and locked tool versions will find this update particularly helpful.
  Bug Fixes
  - Environment variable resolution for tool templates: When using env._.source to source environment files, tool templates now correctly resolve the sourced environment variables. Previously, tool version templates that depended on sourced env vars might not have worked as expected. Thanks to @corymhall for this fix! #7895
  - npm package manager dependencies: When using mise to manage Node.js package managers (npm, yarn, pnpm, bun), mise now only declares the specifically configured package manager as a dependency rather than all of them. This prevents unnecessary dependency resolution issues. #7995
  - Respect use_locked_version during upgrades: The mise upgrade command now properly respects the use_locked_version setting when checking tracked configs. If you have this setting enabled, upgrades will now correctly use the locked versions from your config files. #7997
  - Ignore MISE_TOOL_VERSION in env parsing: Fixed an issue where the internal MISE_TOOL_VERSION environment variable could interfere with environment variable parsing, preventing potential conflicts in certain workflows. #8004
