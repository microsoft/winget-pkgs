ReleaseNotes: |-
  A bug-fix release that enables Tera template rendering in hooks, eliminates a class of stale PATH bugs with aqua tools, improves error messages for unsupported registry tools, and removes the long-deprecated python.venv_auto_create setting.
  Fixed
  - Hooks now support Tera template rendering -- Hook scripts can now use Tera template variables like {{tools.ripgrep.path}}, just like tasks. Additionally, the install progress bar is now cleared before postinstall hooks run, so hook output is no longer masked by the progress UI. Preinstall hooks correctly skip tools=true env directives since referenced tools may not yet be installed. #8385 by @jdx
  - Aqua tool PATH entries no longer go stale -- The aqua backend's bin_paths disk cache (bin_paths.msgpack.z) has been removed entirely. This cache provided negligible performance benefit -- reading and decompressing a msgpack file is comparable to parsing the small YAML registry entry -- but was the root cause of stale PATH entries after tool installs (e.g. upgrading uv causing its PATH entry to vanish). The previous fix in v2026.2.23 was raceable by concurrent mise hook-env calls; removing the cache eliminates this class of bugs completely. #8383 by @jdx
  - Better error when a registry tool has no supported backends -- When a tool exists in the registry but all its backends are filtered out for the current platform or configuration (e.g. imagemagick on a platform where only conda and asdf backends are registered but disabled), the error now clearly explains the situation and lists the registered backends instead of suggesting the user meant the exact tool name they already typed. #8388 by @jdx
  Removed
  - Deprecated python.venv_auto_create setting removed -- The python.venv_auto_create and python_venv_auto_create settings have been fully removed. These were deprecated in favor of the _.python.venv configuration. If you were relying on the legacy virtualenv tool option to auto-create venvs, mise will now warn and print manual creation instructions instead. Migrate to the newer venv configuration: #8384 by @jdx
    [tools]
    python = { version = "3.12", _.python.venv = { path = ".venv", create = true } }
  Breaking Changes
  - The python.venv_auto_create and python_venv_auto_create settings no longer exist. If you still have these in your configuration, they will be silently ignored. Use _.python.venv = { path = ".venv", create = true } in your tool configuration instead. #8384
