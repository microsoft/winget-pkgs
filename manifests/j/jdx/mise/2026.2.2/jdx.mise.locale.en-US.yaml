ReleaseNotes: |-
  This release brings quality-of-life improvements that make mise smarter and more helpful. When you mistype a tool name, mise now suggests what you might have meant with "Did you mean?" hints, and warns you about inactive tools that might need attention. Python users will appreciate the reworked python.uv_venv_auto setting that gives more control over virtual environment management.
  Highlights
  - "Did you mean?" suggestions - Mistype a tool name and mise will now suggest similar tools you might have intended, plus warn about inactive tools in your config (#7965)
  - Reworked python.uv_venv_auto setting - The UV virtual environment auto-creation behavior has been improved for better control over when and how venvs are created. See the Python documentation for details. Thanks @halms! (#7905)
  - Windows mingw-w64 detection - The asset matcher now properly detects mingw-w64 packages for Windows, improving tool installation on Windows systems. Thanks @lchagnoleau! (#7981)
  - vfox plugin download_path - Plugin authors can now access download_path in the BackendInstall context, making it easier to write plugins that need to reference downloaded files. Thanks @malept! (#7959)
  Bug Fixes
  - Prefer-offline mode improvements - hook-env no longer attempts to fetch remote versions for uninstalled tools when running in prefer-offline mode (#7976)
  - ETXTBSY retry - Fixed an edge case where spawning processes could fail with "Text file busy" errors by adding automatic retries (#7964)
  - ToolOptions comma parsing - Tool options now properly support comma-separated values, fixing issues with complex option configurations. Thanks @roele! (#7971)
  Documentation
