Moniker: mise
ReleaseNotes: |-
  This release brings two significant quality-of-life improvements: enhanced error diagnostics for configuration files and a new environment caching system. When you make a typo in your mise.toml, you'll now get beautifully formatted error messages with precise line and column information thanks to miette diagnostics. The new environment caching feature can dramatically speed up shell activation for projects with complex environment setups.
  Highlights
  TOML Parsing Diagnostics - Configuration errors now display with clear, contextual error messages showing exactly where the problem is in your file. No more guessing which line has the syntax error! #7764 by @jdx
  Environment Caching - A new caching system for environment resolution that supports module-level cacheability. This can significantly speed up mise activate for projects with many tools or complex configurations. #7761 by @jdx
