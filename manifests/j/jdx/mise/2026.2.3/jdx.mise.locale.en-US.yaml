ReleaseNotes: |-
  This patch release fixes an important bug affecting users who use mise in locked mode with pipx, npm, cargo, or asdf backends. Previously, these backends would fail when lockfile enforcement was enabled—now they work seamlessly with your locked configurations.
  This release also includes a security-related dependency update and welcomes three new tools to the registry: mermaid-ascii for creating ASCII diagrams from Mermaid syntax, Godot game engine, and Julia programming language support.
  Bug Fixes
  - Locked mode now works with more backends - Users can now use mise install with pipx, npm, cargo, and asdf backends when lockfile mode is enabled. Previously these backends would fail in locked mode, forcing users to disable lockfiles or use different installation methods. #7985
  Security
  - Updated the bytes crate to 1.11.1 to address RUSTSEC-2026-0007. #7986
  New Tools
  - mermaid-ascii - Generate ASCII art diagrams from Mermaid diagram syntax, great for documentation and terminal-based workflows. Thanks @TyceHerrman! #7984
  - godot - The popular open-source game engine is now available via mise. Thanks @dmarcoux! #7989
  - julia - The Julia programming language can now be installed and managed with mise. Thanks @quinnj! #7990
