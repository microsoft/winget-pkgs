Moniker: mise
ReleaseNotes: |-
  This release brings a couple of nice quality-of-life improvements alongside several bug fixes.
  Highlights
  Shell-style variable expansion in env values (#8029) - You can now use shell-style variable expansion like ${VAR:-default} and ${VAR:+alternate} directly in your mise.toml environment variables. This makes it easier to set up flexible configurations without needing to drop into shell scripts.
  New --all-sources flag for mise ls (#8019) - Thanks to @TylerHillery for adding this flag, which shows all the sources where a tool version is defined. Useful for debugging why a particular version is being used when you have multiple config files.
  Bug Fixes
  - gem backend: Fixed Windows support and resolved a newline issue in gem scripts (#8031, #8034) - Thanks @my1e5!
  - lockfile: Tools are now written to the lockfile matching their source config, fixing issues where lockfile entries could get misattributed (#8012)
  - mise ls: Sources in --all-sources output are now sorted deterministically (#8037)
  - tasks: File tasks now auto-install tools defined in mise.toml, matching the behavior of inline tasks (#8030)
  Security
  - Updated the time crate to 0.3.47 to address RUSTSEC-2026-0009 (#8026)
