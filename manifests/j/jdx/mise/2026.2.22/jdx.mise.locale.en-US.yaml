ReleaseNotes: |-
  A small release adding a new way to check for outdated plugins, along with three bug fixes for archive installs, tool environment resolution, and cross-platform Ruby lockfiles.
  Added
  - mise plugins ls --outdated flag -- A new -o/--outdated flag checks remote git refs in parallel and displays only plugins where the local SHA differs from the remote. Shows a table with plugin name, URL, ref, local SHA, and remote SHA. Prints "All plugins are up to date" when everything is current. #8360 by @jdx
    $ mise plugins ls --outdated
    Plugin  Url                                             Ref   Local    Remote

  Fixed
  - rename_exe works with archives containing a bin/ subdirectory -- When an archive extracts to a layout like prefix/bin/binary, the rename_exe option was silently skipped because it searched the extraction root non-recursively instead of the bin/ subdirectory where the binary actually lives. Both the GitHub-style backend and the HTTP backend now auto-detect the bin/ subdirectory as the search directory, matching the same logic used by discover_bin_paths() for PATH construction. #8358 by @jdx
  - Installing cargo/npm/pipx tools no longer crashes with tools = true env directives -- When [env] contained entries like NODE_VERSION = { value = "{{ tools.node.version }}", tools = true }, installing npm/cargo/pipx tools would fail with "Variable not found in context" because the referenced tools might not be installed yet. The cargo, npm, and pipx backends now skip tools = true env directive resolution during installation while still including tool paths in PATH. #8356 by @jdx
  - Ruby lockfile resolves correct Windows checksums -- Running mise lock on macOS/Linux now correctly resolves RubyInstaller2 binary URLs and checksums for Windows platform entries, instead of incorrectly using the MRI source tarball checksum. The lockfile generator now fetches the correct .7z asset from the oneclick/rubyinstaller2 GitHub releases for Windows targets. #8357 by @jdx
  Changed
  - Registry: terradozer switched to GitHub fork -- The terradozer registry entry now points to github:chenrui333/terradozer (replacing the archived asdf plugin and unavailable aqua backend), and is restricted to Linux and macOS. #8365 by @chenrui333
