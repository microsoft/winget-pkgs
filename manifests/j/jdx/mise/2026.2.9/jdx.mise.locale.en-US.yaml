ReleaseNotes: |-
  This release brings a quality-of-life improvement for Ruby users on older Linux distributions, plus a couple of important bug fixes.
  Highlights
  Automatic Ruby variant selection for older glibc systems (#8069)
  If you're running Linux with glibc older than 2.35 (common on RHEL 7, Amazon Linux 2, CentOS 7, or older Debian/Ubuntu versions), mise will now automatically download the no-YJIT precompiled Ruby variant instead of failing with cryptic errors. This means precompiled Ruby "just works" on a much wider range of Linux systems without any manual configuration. Systems with glibc 2.35+ (Ubuntu 22.04+, Debian 12+, Fedora 36+) continue to get the standard YJIT-enabled builds as before.
  Bug Fixes
  - Windows shim updates with self-update (#8075) — mise self-update on Windows now properly updates mise-shim.exe alongside mise.exe. Previously, users had to manually download the shim from GitHub releases after updating.
  - Fixed cargo install mise (#8077) — Bumped the xx dependency to 2.5 to fix an issue where Cargo was selecting an incompatible older version, causing installation failures. Thanks @erickt for the fix and welcome to mise!
  Documentation
  - Ruby precompiled binaries are no longer marked as experimental (#8073) — they're stable and ready for production use.
