ReleaseNotes: |-
  This release focuses on improving the developer experience for monorepo setups and fixing cross-platform compatibility issues. If you've been struggling with task includes in monorepos or encountering strange behavior when cloning plugins on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), this update has you covered.
  Bug Fixes
  - Monorepo task includes now resolve correctly - Task includes are now resolved relative to the config file directory rather than the current working directory. This is a significant fix for monorepo users who define tasks in nested config files and expect includes to work relative to where the config lives. (#7917)
  - WSL git clone compatibility - Fixed an issue where autocrlf settings could cause problems when cloning git repositories on WSL. Mise now explicitly disables autocrlf during git clone operations, preventing line-ending issues that could break plugins and tools on Windows Subsystem for Linux. (#7916)
  Documentation
  - Added documentation for using bash array patterns with variadic arguments in tasks, making it easier to handle variable numbers of arguments in your task definitions. (#7914) See the tasks documentation for more details.
