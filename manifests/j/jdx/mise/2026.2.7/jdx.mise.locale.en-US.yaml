ReleaseNotes: |-
  This release brings a significant improvement for Windows users with native .exe shims, along with several bug fixes that improve the reliability of tool installation and version resolution.
  Highlights
  Native Windows Shims (#8045)
  mise now generates native .exe shim files instead of .cmd batch scripts. This resolves a whole category of frustrating issues:
  - No more intermittent ENOENT errors from spawnSync in node
  - where.exe now correctly finds your tools
  - Better compatibility with package managers like npm and bun that expect real executables
  - Proper control flow in batch scripts
  The new "exe" mode is now the default for windows_shim_mode. This follows the same pattern used by Scoop, Volta, and Chocolatey. If you need to switch back, you can set windows_shim_mode = "file" in your settings. Thanks to @iki for helping with this.
  Bug Fixes
  - Config options preserved during CLI installs (#8044) - Running mise install tool@version with an explicit version no longer loses tool-level config options like postinstall from your mise.toml. Registry defaults (like uvx=false or pipx_args) are also preserved when using table syntax.
  - Linked versions take priority over lockfiles (#8050) - Tools created with mise link now correctly override lockfile entries during version resolution. Previously, a lockfile pin would override your linked version, causing confusing "missing" warnings.
  - Fixed duplicate entries in ls --all-sources (#8042) - Thanks @roele!
  Registry Updates
  - Switched oxlint to use npm backend by default (#8038) - Thanks @risu729!
  - Added orval for OpenAPI client generation: mise use orval (#8051) - Thanks @zdunecki for your first contribution!
