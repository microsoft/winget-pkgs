ReleaseNotes: |-
  This release brings MCP task execution support, better Node.js flavor guidance, and a solid round of bug fixes across several backends.
  Highlights
  - MCP run_task tool — You can now execute mise tasks directly through the MCP interface. The new run_task tool runs tasks via subprocess with full stdout/stderr capture, timeout support, and hardened execution. An install_tool stub is also included for future expansion. #8179 by @joaommartins
  - Node flavor suggestions — When a Node.js version isn't found in the configured mirror, mise now suggests setting node.flavor to help you get to the right download faster. #8206 by @risu729
  - Registry stack overflow fix — The registry BTreeMap is now built directly on the heap, eliminating a stack overflow that could occur with large registries. #8214 by @risu729
  Bug Fixes
  - Java version sorting — Shorthand Java versions (e.g., 21, 17) now sort correctly. #8197 by @roele
  - Node env var migration — Node-related environment variables have been properly migrated to the settings system. #8200 by @risu729
  - Registry overrides in shims — Registry overrides are now correctly applied when running tools through shims. #8199 by @risu729
  - Rust outdated duplication — Fixed mise outdated showing Rust versions twice. #8209 by @roele
  - GitHub aliased backend resolution — Version lookups no longer break for tools aliased to a different backend than the registry default. #8221
  - GitHub attestation output — Attestation verification success is now shown in progress output. #8230
  - Cargo binstall setting migration — MISE_CARGO_BINSTALL_ONLY has been migrated to the settings system. #8202 by @risu729
