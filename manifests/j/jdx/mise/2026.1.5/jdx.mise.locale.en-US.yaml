ReleaseNotes: |-
  This release brings PowerShell users into the mise ecosystem with full tab completion support, making mise more accessible to Windows developers and PowerShell enthusiasts everywhere. The vfox backend also receives significant upgrades with rolling release support and a new semver Lua module for smarter version sorting.
  File task handling gets a reliability boost with improved parsing, validation, and better error messages when unknown fields appear in task headers. Several schema and configuration fixes ensure your mise setup works more predictably across different scenarios.
  Highlights
  - PowerShell Completion Support: Tab completion now works in PowerShell sessions, bringing the same convenient autocomplete experience that bash, zsh, and fish users enjoy. See the shell completions documentation for setup instructions. (#7746) by @jdx
  - Vfox Rolling Releases: The vfox backend now supports rolling releases with checksum tracking, enabling tools that publish frequent updates without traditional version numbers. A new semver Lua module also improves version sorting accuracy. (#7757, #7739) by @jdx
  - Improved File Task Parsing: File tasks now have DRYer parsing logic and validate unknown fields in headers, catching configuration mistakes earlier with clearer error messages. (#7738, #7733) by @makp0
