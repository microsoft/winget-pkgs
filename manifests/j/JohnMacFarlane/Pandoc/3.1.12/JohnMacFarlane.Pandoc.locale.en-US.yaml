ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Add djot as input and output format. Djot is a light markup syntax (https://djot.net).
  - New module Text.Pandoc.Readers.Djot [API change]. The function readDjot is also exported by Text.Pandoc.Readers.
  - New module Text.Pandoc.Writers.Djot [API change]. The function writeDjot is also exported by Text.Pandoc.Writers.

  - --number-sections now uses the first digit for the number of the top-level section, no matter what its level. So if the top-level section is level-2, numbers will be 1, 2, etc. rather than 0.1, 0.2, as in the past (#5071). For some backwards compatibility, we revert to the old behavior when the --number-offset option is used.
  - DocBook reader:
  - Better handling of <procedure> and <substeps> (#9341): <procedure> now gets parsed as an ordered list, and <substeps> as a sublist.

  - Man reader:
  - Move spaces outside of emph/strong (#9445).

  - MediaWiki reader:
  - Don’t make leading blanks underscores in image links (#9425).
  - Allow lowercase image: (#9424).

  - BibTeX reader:
  - Support pagetotal in converting BibLaTeX.

  - Markdown reader:
  - Fix wikilinks extensions to allow newlines in titles (#9454).

  - EPUB reader:
  - Don’t put # characters in identifiers.

  - LaTeX reader:
  - Improve treatment of \cref, \Cref (#7463). Use the reference-type ref+label and ref+Label. Also, associate with \vref ref instead of ref+page.
  - Limited support for \Cref (#7463).
  - Generate relative widths for \linewidth, \textheight (#9388).

  - Typst reader:
  - Fix handling of \overline (#9294). Due to a typo, it was being incorrectly rendered as an \underset.
  - Improve handling of inline #quote (#9413).
  - Fix handling of dot(), tilde(), ddot() (jgm/typst-hs#38).
  - Fix character used for norm (jgm/typst-hs#38).

  - Typst writer:
  - Use reference form (e.g. @jones2000[p. 30]) for citations when possible.
  - Use #ref or @ for links with reference-type="ref" (#7463). This attribute is added to LaTeX \cref, for example.
  - Improve citation support (#9452). Emit form: "prose" or form: "year" qualifiers if the citation is author-in-text or suppress-author. Strip initial comma from suffix, since typst will add an extra one.
  - Unescape URI escapes in image paths (#9389).
  - Handle labels and citaiton ids with spaces and other special characters (#9387). In these cases, we produce an explicit label() rather than using <> or @.
  - Avoid producing illegal labels (#9387).
  - Avoid unnecessary escapes (#9386).

  - LaTeX writer:
  - Make writer sensitive to empty_paragraphs extension (#9443).
  - Fix beamer highlighting (mh4ckt3mh4ckt1c4s).
  - Create valid table even when table is empty (#9350).
  - Set font fallback for babel main font (Max Heller).
  - Add some kerns where needed between quotes (#9371).

  - HTML writer:
  - Add suffix to multiple footnote section ids, so they are unique (Sam May). This is necessary when --reference-location is block or section.

  - EPUB writer:
  - Add ARA roles for accessibility (#9378, Iacobus1983). Footnote references are given role “doc-noteref”, footnote text gets “doc-footnote”, and nav gets “doc-toc”.
  - Ensure that an alt attribute is always added (#9354). This seems to be required by iBooks; even an empty alt attribute will satisfy it.
  - Add xml:lang to package element (#9372).
  - Add accessibility metadata to EPUB metadata (#9372, #9400, Iacobus1983 and John MacFarlane). Reasonable default values are used to ensure that pandoc’s EPUBs conform to the EU Accessibilty Act requirements, but values can be overridden using metadata.

  - Docx writer:
  - Restore ability to center-justify table (#9393). The fix to #5947 caused all tables to be left indented. This was necessary to avoid extra indentation in table cells when a table appeared in a list item. This change makes the changes conditional, so that they only affect tables in list items.

  - Man writer:
  - Fix bug with long URLs (#9458). URLs with more than 68 characters didn’t display properly because of wrapping.
  - Support (limited) syntax highlighting in code blocks (#9446). Currently only boldface and italics are supported. The monochrome style might be of use for those generating man pages.

  - Org writer:
  - Escape special lines in code blocks (#9218, Albert Krewinkel).

  - Markdown writer:
  - Use different width fences for nested divs (#9450). Outer divs have longer fences. This aids clarity for the reader, making it easier to see where the div ends. It also makes the output compatible with some other implementations, e.g. micromark, which require different-width fences for nesting.
  - Fix output for pipe tables with a huge number of columns (#9346). Previously we got invalid pipe tables when the number of table columns exceeded the setting of --columns.

  - Powerpoint writer:
  - Fix regression in layout for slides with figures (#9442).
  - Use internal column widths in pptx writer tables (#5706, Tomas Dahlqvist). The table writer used to only divide all available width evenly for all columns. In this update the code uses the incoming widths if they are available. If they are not set the earlier even distribution is used. Some of the golden templates are adjusted slightly because of different rounding when using the new calculation model.

  - Custom writers:
  - Fix handling of common state (#9229, Albert Krewinkel). The CommonState (PANDOC_STATE in Lua) may change between the time that a custom writer script is first loaded and when the writer is run. However, the writer was always using the initial state, which led to problems, e.g. when the mediabag was updated in a filter, as those updates where not visible to the writer. The state is now updated right before the writer function runs.

  - Text.Pandoc.SelfContained:
  - Fix id replacements in SVGs with clipping paths (#9420). This fixes --embed-resources when SVGs have clip-path attributes.
  - Fix size of duplicated SVGs with --embed-resources (#9439).

  - ConTeXt template: support font fallback (#9361, Lawrence Chonavel).
  - Text.Pandoc.Shared:
  - addPandocAttributes: use wrapper attribute, not wrap, for Divs and Spans added as wrappers to hold attributes on elements that do not accept them.
  - makeSections behavior changes:
  - When the optional base level parameter is provided, we no longer ensure that the sequence of heading levels is gapless (#9398). Instead, we set the lowest heading level to the specified base level, and adjust the others accordingly. If an author wants to skip a level, e.g. from level 1 to level 3, they can do that. In general, the heading levels specified in the source document are preserved; makeSections only puts them into a hierarchical structure.
  - Section numbers are now assigned differently, as described above under --number-sections changes (#5071).

  - Improve makeSections code for section number calculation.

  - Text.Pandoc.Chunks:
  - Autogenerate unique ids for sections missing them (#9383). This is needed for TOC generation to work properly. We can’t create TOC links if there are no ids. This fixes some EPUB validation issues we’ve been getting since switching over to Chunks for chunking.
  - Improve fixTOCTreePaths. We weren’t adding ids for section headings that don’t head a chunk, but these headings are needed for a TOC.

  - Lua: catch encoding error in pandoc.read (#9385, Albert Krewinkel). Fixed a bug that could lead to an un-catchable error and program termination when pandoc.read was called with invalid UTF-8 input.
  - LaTeX template: support font fallback (lawcho). This support is LuaLaTeX-specific. See MANUAL.txt for documentation.
  - Text.Pandoc.Readers: Add readMan to exports [API change] (George Stagg).
  - Text.Pandoc.PDF:
  - Reliably detect when TOC has changed (#9295). Sometimes the TOC changes but there are no warnings: this happens when no labels are present. In this case we must rerun LaTeX. So we now take the SHA1 hash of the TOC file and rerun LaTeX if it changes between runs.
  - Increase maximum number of LaTeX runs to 4 (#9299). On some documents, 4 runs are needed (e.g. when a LastPage reference is used).
  - Avoid readFileLazy, which caused improperly cleaned-up temp directories on Windows (#9460).

  - MANUAL.txt:
  - Harmonize spelling of Markdown and MultiMarkdown (#9402, Salim B).
  - Add <pre> to list of exceptions for markdown_in_html_blocks extension (#9305).
  - Add clarification to docs for --resource-path (#9417).

  - Makefile: Validate generated EPUB as part of prerelease checks.
  - Add validation for docx golden files to CI (Edwin Török).
