ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Markdown reader: Fix bug with footnotes at end of fenced div (#9576).
  - LaTeX reader:
      - Improve tokenization of @ (#9555). Make tokenization sensitive to \makeatletter/\makeatother. Previously we just always treated @ as a letter. This led to bad results, e.g. with the sequence \@. E.g., a\@ b would parse as “ab” and a\@b as “a”.
      - Make withRaw work inside parseFromToks (#9517). This is needed for raw environments to work inside table cells.
      - Better handling of table colwidths (#9579). Previously the parser just failed if the column width specified in p{} wasn’t a multiple of \linewidth. This led to cases where content was skipped.
  - Typst writer:
      - Add ‘kind’ parameter to figures with tables (#9574).
      - Avoid unnecessary box around image in figure (#9236).
      - Omit width/height in images unless explicitly specified (#9236). Previously we computed width/heigth for images that didn’t have size information, because otherwise typst would expand the image to fit page width. This typst behavior has changed in 0.11. This change fixes a bug in which images would sometimes overflow page margins, depending on their intrinsic size.
      - Don’t add hard-coded inset to tables (#9580). Instead, set this globally in the default template, allowing it to be customized.
  - LaTeX template: Fix block headings support for unnumbered paragraphs (#9542, #6018, Oliver Fabel).
  - HTML templates: Replace polyfill provider (#9537, @SukkaW). Replace polyfill.io with cdnjs.cloudflare.com/polyfill. polyfill.io has been acquired by Funnull, and the service has become unstable.
  - Korean translations: delete colon in translation for ‘to’. This was invalid YAML, and not desired anyway, since a colon is added.
  - Use latest commonmark, commonmark-extensions. This fixes a 3.12 regression in parsing of commonmark/gfm autolinks (jgm/commonmark-hs#151).
  - Depend on djot 0.1.1.3, which fixes a serious parsing bug affecting regular paragraphs after lists.
  - Depend on latest skylighting, skylighting-core, typst-hs, texmath.
  - MANUAL.txt: Change broken link to IDML cookbook (#9563).
