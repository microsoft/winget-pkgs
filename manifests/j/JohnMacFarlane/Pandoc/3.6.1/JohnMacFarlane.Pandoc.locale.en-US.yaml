ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Allow YAML bibliographies to be arrays of references (#10452). Previously, they had to be YAML objects with a references key.
  - Change --template to allow use of extensionless templates (#5270). The intent is to allow bash process substitution: e.g., --template <(echo "foo"). Previously pandoc always added an extension based on the output format, which caused problems with the absolute filenames used by bash process substitution (e.g. /dev/fd/11). Now, if the template has no extension, pandoc will first try to find it without the extension, and then add the extension if it can’t be found. So, in general, extensionless templates can now be used. But this has been implemented in a way that should not cause problems for existing uses, unless you are using a template NAME.FORMAT but happen to have an extensionless file NAME in the template search path.
  - Allow --shift-heading-level-by=-1 to work in djot in the same way it works for other formats (with the top-level heading being promoted to metadata title) (#10459). This needed special treatment because of the way djot surrounds sections with Divs.
  - RST reader:
      - Handle explicit reference links (#10484, Evan Silberman). This case was missed when changing the reference link strategy for RST to allow a single pass. (It is a regression in pandoc 3.6.)
  - Markdown reader:
      - Use T.P.URI’s pBase64DataURI in parsing data URIs (#10075, Evan Silberman and John MacFarlane).
      - More efficient base64 data URI parsing (#10075, Evan Silberman and John MacFarlane). This should yield dramatic performance improvements for markdown documents containing large data URIs in images.
  - HTML reader:
      - Don’t canonicalize data: URIs (#10075). It can be very expensive to call network-uri’s URI parser on these.
  - LaTeX reader:
      - Handle figure* environment as a figure (#10472).
  - MediaWiki reader:
      - Allow empty quoted attributes (#10490).
      - Allow cells starting with + (#10491).
  - Textile reader:
      - Improve parsing of spans (#9878). The span needs to be separated from its surroundings by spaces. Also, a span can have attributes, which we now attach.
      - Inline constructors shouldn’t trigger if closer is preceded by whitespace (#10414).
  - Docx writer:
      - Put chapters in separate sections, and restart footnotes by section by default (#2773). The main effect of this change is that when --top-level-division=chapter is used, chapters will start on a new page and footnote numbering will restart for each chapter. Both of these defaults can be overridden in the reference.docx.
      - Use styleIds not styleNames for Title, Subtitle, etc. (#10282). This fixes a regression introduced in pandoc 3.5. This change affects the default openxml template as well as the OpenXML writer.
  - Markdown writer:
      - Avoid collapsing of initial/final newline in markdown raw blocks. This makes it easy to write a filter that adds extra blank lines before certain elements (#10477).
  - Mediawiki writer:
      - Escape line-initial characters that would otherwise be interpreted as list starts (#9700).
  - LaTeX writer:
      - Properly handle boolean value for csquotes variable (#10403).
      - Use displayquote for block quotes with csquotes (#10456).
  - HTML writer:
      - Avoid calling parseURIString for data URIs (#10075). This was done to determine the “media category,” but we can get that directly from the mime component of data: URIs.
  - Typst writer:
      - Properly handle data URIs in images (#10460).
  - LaTeX/Beamer templates:
      - Fix default.beamer nocite location (Thomas Hodgson). It must be inside a frame or it is ignored (#10465).
      - Move nocites from LaTeX preamble to body (#10461, Thomas Hodgson). Putting \nocite in the preamble works only with biblatex.
  - Text.Pandoc.Parsing:
      - Correct example in comment on charsInBalanced (Evan Silberman).
  - Text.Pandoc.Error:
      - Mention typst in rendering PandocUnknownWriterError for pdf (Evan Silberman).
  - Text.Pandoc.MediaBag:
      - insertMedia: fast path for data URIs. Avoid the slow URI parser from network-uri on large data URIs (#10075).
  - Text.Pandoc.Class:
      - Add shortcut for base64 data URIs in downloadOrRead (#10075). This avoids calling the slow URI parser from network-uri on data URIs, instead calling our own parser.
  - Text.Pandoc.MIME:
      - Fix extensionFromMimeType. We had a few special cases encoded, but as previously written they wouldn’t work properly with modifiers like ;charset=utf-8.
  - Text.Pandoc.URI:
      - Export pBase64DataURI. Modify isURI to use this and avoid calling network-uri’s inefficient parseURI for data URIs.
  - Text.Pandoc.PDF:
      - Fix temp file extension in toPdfViaTempFile (#10468). This fixes a regression in pandoc 3.6, which changed the extension from html to source. Apparently wkhtmltopdf needs it to be .html. So now we have added a parameter to toPdfViaTempFile that allows the extension to be specified in a way that is appropriate to the PDF engine used.
  - Lua (Albert Krewinkel):
      - Support more elements as input to pandoc.utils.stringify (#10450). Elements of type Caption, Cell, TableHead, and TableFoot can now be stringified.
      - Add Caption constructor to pandoc module.
  - Miscellaneous code quality improvements (Joseph C. Sible).
  - Depend on citeproc 0.8.1.2, skylighting and skylighting-core 0.14.5.
  - `doc/lua-filters.md: Fix links to constructors (Albert Krewinkel).
