ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Change to --file-scope behavior (#8741): previously a Div with an identifier derived from the filename would be added around the contents of each file. This caused problems for “chunking” files into chapters, e.g. in EPUB. We no longer add the surrounding Div. This cooperates better with chunking. Note, however, that if you have relied on the old behavior to link to the beginning of the contents of a file using its filename as identifier, that will no longer work.
  - Markdown reader:
      - Allow repeated labels in numbered example lists. Previously if you tried to use the same label as an earlier example list item, you’d get a new number, not the old one, and references to the label would go to the second occurrence. Now an existing label will be reused, and no new number will be generated. Caveat: this only works reliably when the re-used example list item occurs by itself in a list, or occurs in a list of previously used example list items that occur in exactly the same order as previously.
      - Fix normalCite so it doesn’t consume past a closing ] boundary (#9710). This was causing an exponential performance bug on long lists of links containing potential emphasis characters.
      - Generalize inlinesInBalancedBrackets to inBalancedBrackets, with a parameter for the inner parser.
      - Auto-close unclosed divs (#9635). This applies to both fenced and HTML-ish varieties. Otherwise we face an exponential performance problem with backtracking. A warning is issued when a div is implicitly closed.
  - RST reader:
      - Fix figclass and align annotations for figures (#7473, Gokul Rajiv).
  - LaTeX writer:
      - Use polytonicgreek instead of polutonikogreek with babel (#9698). polutonikogreek is outdated. Also recognize both in the LaTeX reader.
      - Improve treatment of math inside soul commands (#1294, #5529). soul commands (ul, hl, st) are very fragile and the math must be handled specially.
  - LaTeX reader:
      - Fix over-eager macro expansion in conditionals (#9676).
      - Parse flalign, flalign* math environments (#9679). We parse these as Math elements with an aligned environment. Semantically it’s not exactly the same, but better than falling back to raw LaTeX.
  - LaTeX template: add titlegraphicoptions variable (#9207, Guilhem Saurel).
  - Docx reader:
      - Issue warning rather than error when we can’t parse EndNote citations (see #8433).
      - Fix anchor in header after anchor (#9626, mbracke).
  - RTF reader:
      - Don’t try to handle non-default code pages (#9683). Emit a warning instead.
  - OpenDocument writer:
      - Implement custom-style for spans (#9657).
  - Typst writer:
      - Add blank line in definition lists with multiple definitions (see #9704).
      - Property output (#9648, Gordon Woodhull). The Typst writer will pass on specially marked attributes as raw Typst parameters on selected elements. This allows extensive customization using filters. A separate document (doc/typst-property-output.md) has been added that provides extensive documentation and examples of the use of this feature.
  - Markdown writer:
      - Don’t try to align columns in pipe tables with lines greater than COLUMNS. The alignment just reduces readibility when the lines soft wrap.
      - Don’t use raw_attribute syntax for raw blocks, unless there is no other option (see #9677). Macros in a raw_attribute block don’t get interpreted when it is read again by pandoc’s markdown reader.
  - ConTeXt writer:
      - Replace depreciated \sc with \setsmallcaps (#9518, James P. Ascher).
  - Docx writer:
      - Use conventional styles/indents for Word bullet lists (#7280).
  - reference.docx:
      - Use current standard Word theme (#7280). This includes using the sans-serif font Aptos instead of the serif font Cambria, and default colors for headings.
      - Remove duplicate DefaultParagraphFont in styles.xml.
  - New module Text.Pandoc.Transforms [API change] (Albert Krewinkel). This module exports the following functions which were formerly exported from Tetx.Pnadoc.Shared: headerShift, filterIpynbOutput, eastAsianLineBreakFilter, as well as some functions that were previously not exported.
  - Text.Pandoc.Shared:
      - headerShift, filterIpynbOutput, and eastAsianLineBreakFilter are no longer exported from this module; they are now exported from Text.Pandoc.Transforms (Albert Krewinkel).
  - Text.Pandoc.Error:
      - Improve reporting of unsupported extensions errors (#9247, Albert Krewinkel).
  - Text.Pandoc.App:
      - Move “transforms” after filters (#9664). This will mean that --shift-heading-level-by affects a heading added by reference-section-title.
  - Text.Pandoc.App.CommandLineOptions:
      - Simplify output for OptVersion. Omit the information about versions of dependencies. We no longer emit version info at this level anyway; pandoc-cli intercepts and handles --version. This code would only be called if someone used the pandoc library function handleWithOptInfo in their own program.
  - Text.Pandoc.ImageSize:
      - Export ImageSize datatype.
  - Text.Pandoc.SelfContained:
      - Merge class attribute when both img and svg specify it (#9652, Carlos Scheidegger).
  - Text.Pandoc.Logging:
      - Add ScriptingInfo constructor for LogMessage [API change] (Albert Krewinkel).
      - Make DocxParserWarning a WARNING, not INFO. [API change].
      - Add UnsupportedCodePage constructor to LogMessage [API change].
      - Add UnclosedDiv constructor for LogMessage [API change].
  - Lua subsystem (Albert Krewinkel:
      - Add a pandoc.log module.
      - Uupdate to pandoc-lua-marshal version 0.2.7 (#8916). This fixes counterintuitive behavior of the content property on BulletList and OrderedList items. Unmarshalling of that field now matches the behavior of the constructor.
      - Use newest zip module. This adds a symlink function to Entry objects, allowing to check if an entry represents a symbolic link.
      - Improve pandoc.json.decode docs.
      - Update and fix docs for pandoc.types.Version and pandoc.utils.type.
      - Add new module pandoc.image The module provides basic querying functions for image properties.
      - Bump pandoc-lua-engine to 0.2.1.4.
  - Use latest KaTeX CDN asset (#9707, Salim B).
  - pandoc-cli: ensure UTF8 when emitting version info.
  - tools/update-lua-module-docs.lua: improve script-internal docs, cleanup (Albert Krewinkel).
  - Allow network 3.2.
  - Use latest versions of texmath, djot, skylighting-core, skylighting.
  - Fix command test for #9652.
  - Fix some typos in code comments (#9638, guqicun).
  - Command tests: include regular PATH after directory with the test executable (ensures that DLLs will be found on Windows).
  - MANUAL.txt:
      - Document handout variable for beamer (#9742).
      - Document formats affected by --slide-level (#9745).
      - Update the list of required LaTeX packages (#9728, Albert Krewinkel).
      - Use more descriptive link text for ODT (#9673).
      - Add clarification about toc-title in docx, pptx (#9645).
      - Better document truthiness for conditionals (#9661).
      - Mention that custom-style works with ODT (Ian Max Andolina).
      - Harmonize typographic dashes (#9688, Salim B). Standardize on --- with no space.
  - INSTALL.md: Minor tweaks (#9705, Leo Heitmann Ruiz).
