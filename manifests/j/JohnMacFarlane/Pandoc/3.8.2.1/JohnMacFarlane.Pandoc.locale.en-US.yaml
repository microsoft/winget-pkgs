ReleaseNotes: |-
  I'm pleased to announce the release of pandoc 3.8.2.1,
  available in the usual places:
  Binary packages & changelog:
  https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases/tag/3.8.2.1
  Source & API documentation:
  http://hackage.haskell.org/package/pandoc-3.8.2.1
  This is primarily a bug-fix release. There are no API changes.
  The main motivation for the release is to fix a serious performance
  regression with --citeproc and the default CSL style,
  chicago-author-date.csl. This style was recently revised in a way that
  took much longer for citeproc to parse. This version of pandoc is
  built with citeproc 0.11, which fixes the performance regression.
  One new feature (added by Albert Krewinkel) is that the Org reader now
  parses parameter lists on unknown blocks, and also supports dynamic
  blocks.
  Thanks to all who contributed, especially new contributors
  Emmanuel Ferdman, FoxChillz, mourino, and priiduonu.
  Of special note:
  - HTML reader: allow blank space between open and close `iframe`.
  - RTF reader: improve hyperlink parsing (#11211).
  - Org reader:
    - Parse parameter lists on unknown blocks (#11188, Albert Krewinkel). The reader tries to parse the rest of the opening line of a block, e.g., `#+begin_myblock …`, as a parameters list. It first assumes that the parameters are in lisp-style (`:key value`), then alternatively tries to read python-style key-value pairs (`key=value`) and falls back to reading the entire remaining line as a single `parameter` attribute.
    - Add support for dynamic blocks.
  - Docx writer: properly handle nested comment spans (#8189, #6959, mourino).
  - RST writer: Don’t use simple tables with RowSpans (#11214, Tuong Nguyen Manh).
  - Typst writer: Escape open paren after non-space (#11210). This fixes an issue that occurs if an open paren comes right after e.g. `#strong[test]`.
  - Typst template: ensure that title block is properly centered (#11221).
  - LaTeX writer/template: small fix for unnumbered tables for compatibility with older LaTeX installations (#11201). Thanks to @priiduonu for the solution.
  - MANUAL.txt: Fixed missing backtick (#11209, FoxChillz).
  - Correct anchor references to `pandoc.text` module documentation (#11111, Emmanuel Ferdman).
  - Fixed golden test regeneration in Docx reader test.
  - Allow unicode-data 0.8.
  - Use citeproc 0.11. This fixes a significant performance regression in pandoc 3.8, which was due to a rewrite of the default chicago-author-date.csl file. Performance with `--citeproc` is now on par with what we had in pandoc 3.7, even with the revised Chicago styles.

    - MANUAL.txt: remove some redundancy (#11178, Reuben Thomas).
