ReleaseNotes: |-
  Click to expand changelog
  - Track wikilinks with a class instead of a title (Evan Silberman). Previously wikilinks were distinguished by giving them the title wikilink. Now that we have link attributes, it makes more sense to give them the class wikilink. This change affects all readers and writers that support wikilinks.
  - DocBook reader:
    - Handle title inside orderedlist (#10594). Also some other elements that allow title: blockquote, calloutlist, etc.
    - Better handle informalequation (#10592, tombolano). Include id attribute.
    - Better handle formalpara, example, and sidebar (#8666, tombolano). Include identifiers and titles in each case.
  - Markdown reader:
    - Simplify and fix normal citation parsing (#10584). This fixes a bug that causes some normal citations to be parsed as bracketed regular citations.
  - ODT reader:
    - Create Figure elements for images that are figures (#10567).
    - Avoid producing spurious blockquotes in list items (#9505).
    - Fix unwanted block quotes (#10575). Previously the reader created block quotes whenever a paragraph was marked indented (even though this just affects the first line). With this change we still generate block quotes for content that has an altered left margin, but not for indented paragraphs.
  - Docx reader:
    - Do not issue warning for comments with +styles (#10571, Stephen Reindl).
  - LaTeX reader:
    - Test {,re}newcommand arguments (#4470, Evan Silberman).
  - Pod reader:
    - Consume blanks after =encoding in pod reader (#10537, Evan Silberman).
  - JATS writer:
    - Add CRediT roles to JATS (Charles Tapley Hoyt and Jez Cope, #10152). Enable annotating author roles using the Contribution Role Taxonomy (CRediT) and export this information in conformant JATS.
  - LaTeX writer/templates:
    - Improve babel support (#8283). Previously we used the .ini files for every language, but for European languages these tend to provide inferior results to the .ldf files used by classic Babel. Currently Babel documentation recommends using the classic system for European languages written in Latin and Cyrillic scripts and Vietnamese. So the LaTeX writer and template now follow this guidance.
      Main languages in the list of languages with good “classic” support are added to global documentclass options and will be automatically handled by Babel using the .ldf files.
      If the main language is not in this list, the babeloptions variable will be set to provide=*, which will cause support to be loaded from the .ini file rather than an .ldf. So, for example, setting -V babeloptions='' with a polytonic Greek document will cause the .ldf support to be used instead of the .ini.
      The default setting of this variable can be overwritten, but in most cases the default should give good results.
    - Allow csquotesoptions to be specified.
    - Fix indentation bugs in font-settings.latex.
  - Docx writer:
    - Repeat reference doc’s sectPr for each new section (#10577). Previously we were only carrying over the reference doc’s sectPr at the end of the document, so it wouldn’t affect the intermediate sections that are now added if --top-level-division is chapter or part. This could lead to bad results (e.g. page numbering starting only on the last chapter).
    - Create section divisions with --top-level-division=part (#10576).
    - Improve title style in reference.docx; base Author and Date on Title; remove condensed spacing (Andrew Dunning, #10581).
  - Typst writer:
    - Brace tables with typst:no-figure and typst:text attributes (#10563, Gordon Woodhull).
  - Ms writer:
    - Fix escaping of - (#10536). - should now be escaped in man output but not in ms output (where \- is a unicode minus sign).
  - HTML styles: fix style of hr so it works when printed (#10535, Hendrik Erz). Previously background-color was used to style the hr, but this gets ignored when printing. This commit uses border-top instead.
  - Text.Pandoc.Shared:
    - Handle <abbr> as a span-like inline in htmlSpanLikeElements (#5793, Evan Silberman).
  - Text.Pandoc.MediaBag:
    - Prefer MIME type when determining extensions for MediaBag items (#10557, Max Heller). This should give different results for remote images that are served at URLs that do not contain misleading extensions (e.g. shields.io).
  - Text.Pandoc.Citeproc:
    - Fix moving punctuation before citation notes. This previously worked with regular citations, but not author-in-text citations. Now it works with both.
  - doc/lua-filters.md:
    - Correct luacheck URL (#10589, R. N. West).
    - Add static analysis paragraph to debugging section (#10568, R. N. West).
    - Add note about extensions handling in read and write (Albert Krewinkel).
  - doc/extras.md:
    - Add entry for pandoc-subfigs (R. N. West).
    - Update diagram Lua filter URL and description (R. N. West).
  - MANUAL.txt:
    - Add note on using typst to produce pdf/a-2b.
    - Document top-level-division functionality with Docx (#10579, Andrew Dunning).
  - Raise xml-conduit upper bound.
  - Depend on latest commonmark-pandoc, commonmark-extensions, citeproc, typst.
  - Makefile: make make binpath quiet.
