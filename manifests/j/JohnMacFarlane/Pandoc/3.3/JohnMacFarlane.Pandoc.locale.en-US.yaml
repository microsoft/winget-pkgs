ReleaseNotes: |-
  - New cli option: --link-images. This causes images to be linked rather than embedded in ODT.
  - Allow --number-sections to take an optional true|false argument.
  - RTF reader:
      - Handle \*\shppict without dropping image (#10025).
  - TWiki Reader:
      - Recognize WikiWords as internal links (#9941).
      - Avoid partial function.
  - Typst reader:
      - Ignore ‘pad’ and just parse its body (#9958).
      - Use typst 0.5.0.5. Fixes parsing of equations like $1.$.
  - Docx writer:
      - Fix regression with nested lists (#9994). The bug affects e.g. ordered lists with bullet sublists; after the sublist the top-level list reverts to bullets instead of being properly numbered. This is a regression introduced in version 3.2.1.
  - BibTeX writer:
      - Ensure that “literal” names are enclosed in braces (#9987).
  - Man writer:
      - Use default middle header when metadata does not include header (#9943). This change causes pandoc to omit the middle header parameter when header is not set, rather than emitting "". The parameter is optional and man will use a default based on the section if it is not specified.
  - HTML templates: don’t load polyfill (#9918). This was added in a period when MathJaX required polyfill. MathJaX no longer recommends this and polyfill should no longer be necessary on any reasonably modern browser.
  - Translations:
      - Add ua.yaml (Jens Oehlschlägel).
      - Add a script (tools/update-translations.py) and Makefile target (update-translations) to update translation data automatically from babel and polyglossia upstream (Stephen Huan).
      - Use this script to update language data, increasing the number of languages we cover (Stephen Huan). Fix a few small bugs in existing translations.
  - Fix some mistakes with Japanese language code (#9938). In several places we were mistakenly assuming that the BCP 47 code for Japanese language was jp. It is ja.
  - Text.Pandoc.Options:
      - New field in WriterOptions: writerLinkImages [API change] (#9815).
  - Text.Pandoc.App.Opt:
      - New field in Opt: optLinkImages [API change] (#9815).
  - Lua subsystem:
      - Keep lpeg and re as “loaded” modules (Albert Krewinkel). The modules lpeg and re are now treated as if they had been loaded with require. Previously the modules were only assigned to global values, but could be loaded again via require, thereby allowing to use a system-wide installation. However, this proved to be confusing.The old behavior can be restored by adding the following lines to the top of Lua scripts, or to the init.lua in the data dir.
  debug.registry()['_LOADED'].lpeg = nil
  debug.registry()['_LOADED'].re = nil


  - pandoc-cli: Include pandoc copyright in Lua version info (Albert Krewinkel).
  - pandoc-cli: Refer printing of version info to the Lua interpreter (Albert Krewinkel). The Lua interpreter no longer terminates when called with -v or --version arguments, thus improving compatibility with the default lua interpreter program.
  - Avoid partial functions in JATS reader, DocBook writer, Haddock reader.
  - Allow tls 2.1.x.
  - MANUAL.txt:
      - Make documentation of extensions clearer (#9060).
      - Fix section level for two Extensions entries.
  - lua-filters.md: Partially autogenerate docs for module pandoc (Albert Krewinkel). The documentation system isn’t powerful enough to generate the full documentation automatically.
