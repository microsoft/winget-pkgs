ReleaseNotes: |-
  - New output format: ansi (for formatted console output) (Evan Silberman). Most Pandoc elements are supported and printed in a reasonable way, if not always ideally. This version does no detection of terminal capabilities, nor does it fall back to different output styles for less-capable terminals.
  - Add command line options --table-caption-position and --figure-caption-position. These allow the user to specify whether to put captions above or below tables and figures, respectively. The following output formats are supported: HTML (and related such as EPUB), LaTeX (and Beamer), Docx, ODT/OpenDocument, Typst.
  - Change default --pdf-engine via HTML to WeasyPrint (#10142). wkhtmltopdf is deprecated. weasyprint is the easiest-to-install, maintained alternative. For better results, one might prefer pagedjs-cli.
  - Org reader:
      - Fix parsing of src blocks with an -i flag (#10071, Albert Krewinkel). Tabs are now preserved in the contents of src blocks if the the block has the -i flag.
  - RTF reader:
      - Handle images inside shp contexts (#10145).
  - RST reader:
  - Improve simple table support (#10093). Multiline rows occur only when the first cell is empty; we were previously treating lines with any empty cell as row continuations. In addition, we no longer wrap multiline cells in Para if they can be represented as Plain. This is consistent with docutils behavior.
  - LaTeX reader:
      - Math environments don’t have bracketed options (#10160).
      - Parse nested tabular environments (#4746).
  - Typst reader:
      - Change how “block” elements are handled. Previously they were always parsed as divs. But actually they can occur in some “inline” contexts. Now we first try to parse them as inlines, and only as blocks if that fails. A surrounding Div or Span element is added only if there is an identifier.
  - HTML reader:
      - Only parse main element’s contents (if present) (#10140). If main has an id or class, we include a div with that id or class; otherwise just the contents.
      - Read TeX annotation in MathML content if present (#9971).
      - Better handle KaTeX-generated math (#9971). KaTeX emits the mathml followed by a span with an HTML fallback. Previously pandoc was converting both. We now ignore the HTML fallback span, marked with class katex-html.
  - New module: Text.Pandoc.Writers.ANSI [API change] (Evan Silberman).
  - Docx writer:
      - Add “SuppressAuthor” and “AuthorOnly” to citationMode when +citations is used (thomjur).
      - Support custom-style attribute for docx table (Sebbones).
      - Support --number-offsets.
      - Make table/figure rendering sensitive to caption position settings.
  - OpenDocument writer:
      - Make table/figure rendering sensitive to caption position settings.
  - Typst writer/template:
      - Implement figure caption positions by triggering a show rule in the default template, which determines caption positions for figures and tables globally.
      - Don’t include trailing semicolon after @ style citations with suffixes (#10148).
      - Template: move header-includes before show doc (#9996, Gordon Woodhull).
  - LaTeX writer:
      - Make table/figure rendering sensitive to caption position settings (#5116).
      - Preserve locator labels with --natbib (#10057).
  - HTML writer/template:
      - Make <figcaption> placement sensitive to caption position settings. For tables, <caption> must be the first element, and positioning is determined by CSS, for here we set a variable which the default template is sensitive to.
      - Use makeSectionsWithOffsets for writerNumberOffsets, instead of the old, inefficient code.
      - Don’t add doc-biblioref role to every link in a citation; only to links to the bibliography (#10156).
      - Add data- when rendering label attribute (#10048).
  - Markdown writer:
      - Avoid emitting markdown caption if table has fallen back to raw HTML, which will then contain a <caption> tag (#10094).
      - Make math sensitive to tex_math_gfm extension (#9121). This means that in GFM output, the “new style” math will be used by default, e.g.
  $`x=y`$

  ```math
  x = y
  ```

  To defeat this and get the older behavior, namely
  $x=y$

  $$x=y$$

  one could use -t gfm-tex_math_gfm.
  - AsciiDoc writer:
      - Add link: prefix when needed (#10105). AsciiDoc requires it except for http, https, irc, mailto, ftp schemes (#10105).
      - Preserve original base level (#10062). We used to normalize so that the base level is always 1, but asciidoc no longer seems to care about that, and the behavior creates difficulties when we are converting fragments.
      - Don’t emit empty figure caption (#10047).
  - ODT writer:
      - Add TableCaption to styles.xml (#10058, Ian Max Andolina).
  - LaTeX template:
      - Fix wrong beamer color in (sub)section page (Jonathan).
  - Text.Pandoc.Options:
      - Add CaptionPosition and new WriterOptions fields writerFigureCaptionPosition and writerTableCaptionPosition [API change].
  - Text.Pandoc.Opt:
      - Change default for optNumberOffset to []. This behaves the same as [0,0,0,0,0].
      - Add Opt fields optFigureCaptionPosition and optTableCaptionPosition [API change].
  - Text.Pandoc.Format: change formatFromFilePaths so that it is smarter about URLs. URLs are parsed, and we take the format from the path component, if present (#10141). This means that https://emacs.org/ will be treated as HTML, while https://emacs.org/sample.org will be treated as Org.
  - Text.Pandoc.URI:
      - Add unofficial gemini: to list of URI schemes (Pau RE).
  - Text.Pandoc.Shared:
      - Add makeSectionsWithOffsets [API change].
      - Remove `stripEmptyParagraphs [API change] (Albert Krewinkel). This function is no longer used.
  - Text.Pandoc.Highlighting: Expose formatANSI [API change] (Evan Silberman).
  - Text.Pandoc.Writers.Shared: export to{Sub,Super}scriptInline [API change] (Evan Silberman).
  - Remove use of partial functions (e.g. head) in code.
  - Use latest skylighting-core, skylighting, doclayout, texmath, typst.
  - pandoc-lua-engine: Add accessors for several writer options, including some that were added in previous releases.
  - pandoc-server: Initialize some missing fields in WriterOptions: writerEpubTitlePage, writerChunkTemplate, writerListTables, writerFigureCaptionPosition, writerTableCaptionPosition.
  - CONTRIBUTING.md: Summarize steps for adding a new cli option.
  - MANUAL.txt:
      - Clarify that the --number-offset option should only directly affect numbering of the first section heading in a document; subsequent headings will increment normally.
      - Fix asciidoc link (#10039).
      - Fix CSL Docs broken link (#10100, Tristano Ajmone).
      - Document the use of luatexja when CJKmainfont is used with lualatex (#3873, Kolen Cheung).
      - Add a citations (typst) section to the manual (#9127).
      - Clarify that citations affects both input and output for org.
      - Add note on --citeproc that you may need to disable citations extension on the output format (e.g., -t markdown-citations) to see the rendered citation (#9127, #10012).
  - INSTALL.md — reorganise info on static binaries and add conda-forge install options (#10098, #10069, Ian Max Andolina).
