  Click to expand changelog
  - Disable citations extension in writers if --citeproc is used (#10662). Otherwise we get undesirable results, as the format’s native citation mechanism is used instead of (or in addition to) the citeproc-generated citations.
  - Markdown reader:
    - Allow line break between URL and title of link (#10621).
    - Give better position information when YAML metadata parsing fails with a YAML exception (#10231).
    - Fixed escapedChar' parser (#10672). It should not accept escaped newlines.
    - Remove some misguided list fanciness (#9865, #7778, cf. #5628). Previously we tried to handle things like commented out list items:
      - one
      <!--
      - two
      -->
      - three
      and also things like:
      - one `and
      - two` and
      But the code we added to handle these cases caused problems with other, more straightforward things, like:
      - one
      - ```
        code
        ```
      - three
      So we are rolling back all the fanciness, so that the markdown parser now behaves more like the commonmark parser, in which indicators of block-level structure always take priority over indicators of inline structure.
  - HTML reader:
    - Skip MathJaX-introduced cruft (#10673).
    - Ignore style tags in the body (#10643).
  - LaTeX reader:
    - Better handle comments/whitespace in option lists and includes (#10659).
    - Support \newline, \linebreak.
  - Docx reader/writer:
    - Revert commit adding row heads (cbe67b9) (#10627). Word sets w:firstColumn="1" by default for tables. You have to find the Table Design tab and explicitly uncheck “First Column” to make this go away. In most cases, I don’t think writers intend to designate the first column as a row head, so this commit is going to produce unexpected results. In addition, because of the table normalization done by pandoc-type’s tableWith, any table containing a colspanned cell in the left-hand column will get broken if the first column is designated a row head. For these reasons it seems best to revert this change, which was made in response to #9495.
  - LaTeX writer and template:
    - Remove selnolig-langs (#9863). We now specify the language as a global option again, so we no longer need to specify it when invoking selnolig.
    - Use babel options shorthands=off (#6817).
    - Use * for multirow width when no colwidth specified (#10685). Otherwise the multirow will be excessively wide.
    - Protect \phantomsection (#10688, etclub).
  - Markdown writer:
    - Omit extra space after bullets (#7172). Those who want the old behavior can obtain it by using -t markdown+four_space_rule.
    - Treat Emph [Emph ils]] as ils (#10642). Otherwise we get **content** which means strong emphasis.
  - EPUB writer:
    - Use a nonbreaking space after section number in nav.xhtml. This seems to be required for iOS books app to display the space.
  - Typst writer:
    - Better heuristics for escaping potential list markers (#10650).
    - Ensure that citation-style works as well as csl (#10661).
  - Powerpoint writer:
    - Avoid extra blank lines before author when there is no subtitle (#10619).
  - JATS template:
    - Fix typo in author prefix in article.jats_publishing template (#10622, Tiago-Manzato).
  - Text.Pandoc.Parsing:
    - Smart quote parsing: ignore curly quotes (#10610). Previously we tried to match curly quotes as well as straight quotes, producing Quoted inlines. But it seems better just to assume that those who use curly quotes want them passed through verbatim. This also fixes an (unintended) bug whereby curly single left quotes would sometimes be changed to single right quotes.
  - Text.Pandoc.Shared:
    - makeSections: put some attributes on section element only. Certain role and epub:type attributes should only be on the section (and indeed, many roles give a validation error if left on the heading element).
  - Text.Pandoc.Logging:
    - Change NoTitleElement from WARNING to INFO (#10671). Users commonly complain about the warning when producing HTML documents without an explicit title. It seems that an info message is more appropriate, since pandoc’s default here (using the input’s base name) ensures compliance with the standard and many users are happy with that default. Those who want to make sure the message is seen can use --verbose.
  - Beamer template: only emit \date if set (#10687, josch).
  - Fix invalid OOXML in definition_list.docx test (#10394).
  - MANUAL.txt:
    - Correct typo: ‘date’ for doubled ‘title’ (#10654, Olivier Dossmann).
    - Add note about template variable for typst.
    - Change maxwidth default in MANUAL.txt (#10683).
    - Improve EPUB metadata documentation.
    - In Security section, alert readers to a threat relating to iframe in HTML, and add LaTeX, Typst to the list of formats that have an include (#10682).
  - doc/lua-filters.md: Add missing html_math_method ‘katex’ (R. N. West).
  - Use texmath 0.12.9.
  - Use typst 0.7. Fixes an issue with package loading, a regression in pandoc 3.6.3.
