ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Docx reader:
      - Ensure that table captions are counted (#9518).
      - Detect caption by style name not id (#9518). The styleId can change depending on the localization.
      - Avoid emitting empty paragraph where caption was.
  - Markdown reader: fix regression in link parsing with wikilinks extensions (#9481). This fixes a regression introduced in 3.1.12.
  - Org reader/writer: support admonitions (#9475).
  - Org writer: omit extra blank line at end of quote block.
  - Typst writer: ensure that -, +, etc. are escaped at beginning of block (#9478). Our recent relaxing of escaping (#9386) caused problems for things like emphasized - characters that were rendered using #strong[-]#. This now gets rendered as #strong[\-].
  - LaTeX writer: fix bug when a language is specified in two different ways (#9472). If you used lang: de-DE but then had a span or div with lang=de, the preamble would try to load ngerman twice, leading to an error. This fix ensures that a language is only loaded once.
  - Docx writer: Don’t copy over footnotePr in settings.xml from reference.docx (#9522).
  - EPUB writer: omit EPUB2-specific meta tag on EPUB3 (#9493). This caused a validation failure in epubs with cover images.
  - Lua: avoid crashing when an error message is not valid UTF-8 (Albert Krewinkel).
  - Text.Pandoc.SelfContained:
      - Add role="img" to svgs.
      - Add aria-label to svg elements with alt text if present. Screen readers ignore alt attributes on svg elements but do pay attention to aria-label (#9525).
  - Text.Pandoc.Shared: Fix regression in section numbering in makeSections (#9516). Starting with pandoc 3.1.12, unnumbered sections incremented the section number.
  - Text.Pandoc.Class: fix openUrl TLS negotiation (#9483). With the release of TLS 2.0.0, the TLS library started requiring Extended Main Secret for the TLS handshake. This caused problems connecting to zotero’s server and others that do not support TLS 1.3. This commit relaxes this requirement.
  - Depend on djot 0.1.1.0 (fixes rendering on multiline block attributes).
  - Use new releases of skylighting-format-blaze-html (#9520). Fixes auto-wrapping of long source lines in HTML print media.
  - Use new commonmark-extensions (fixes issue with the rebase_relative_paths extension when used with commonmark/gfm.
  - Makefile: improve epub-validation target (#9493). Use --epub-cover-image to catch issues that only arise with that.
