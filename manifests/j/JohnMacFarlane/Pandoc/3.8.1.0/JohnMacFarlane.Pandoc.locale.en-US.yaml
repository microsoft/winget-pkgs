ReleaseNotes: |-
  I'm pleased to announce the release of pandoc 3.8.1,
  available in the usual places:
  Binary packages & changelog:
  https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases/tag/3.8.1
  Source & API documentation:
  http://hackage.haskell.org/package/pandoc-3.8.1
  This release introduces a few new features and fixes some bugs
  and regressions. Of special note:
  - New output format vimdoc (for Vim documentation).
  - --syntax-highlighting now works as expected for typst output.
  - New shorthands variable allows activating babel shorthands
    in LaTeX/PDF output.
  - Removed coloring for links in epub.css, so that the reader's
    defaults will be used.
  API changes:
  - New module Text.Pandoc.Writers.Vimdoc, exporting writeVimdoc.
  - Text.Pandoc.Parsing: new functions tableWithSpans,
    tableWithSpans', toTableComponentsWithSpans, and
    toTableComponentsWithSpans'.
  - Text.Pandoc.Shared: new function removeLinks.
  - Text.Pandoc.Highlighting: export functions formatTypstBlock,
    formatTypstInline, styleToTypst (from skylighting).
  Thanks to all who contributed, especially Tuong Nguyen Manh (who
  has been working hard to improve table support) and new contributors
  Raymond Berger and reptee.

  - New output format vimdoc (Vim documentation format) (#11132, reptee).
    - [API change] Added module Text.Pandoc.Writers.Vimdoc, exporting writeVimdoc.
  - Markdown reader:
    - Improve superscript/subscript/inline note parsing (#8652). We do not allow inline notes to be followed by ( or [. Otherwise, we parse inline notes before superscripts. Also, the sub/superscript parsers have been adjusted so that they really exclude unescaped spaces (as they did not before, when the spaces occurred in nested inlines).
    - Fix simple table alignment (#11136, Tuong Nguyen Manh). Take wide characters into account when determining the alignment.
  - LaTeX reader:
    - Ignore \pandocbounded (#11140).
  - XML reader:
    - Parse <MetaString> (#11137, massifrg).
  - Typst reader:
    - Add support for reading typst pagebreak (#11101, Raymond Berger). The pagebreak is parsed as a HorizontalRule inside a wrapper Div with class page-break.
  - Docx reader:
    - Handle figures in indented paragraphs (#11028).
    - Change default for textwidth. This should only be used if sectPr is not found.
    - Properly calculate table column widths (#9837, #11147). Previously we assumed that every table took up the full text width. Now we read the text width from the document’s sectPr.
    - Use Tasty.Golden for Docx reader tests. This way we can update them with --accept.
  - RST reader:
    - Fix regression in simple table parsing (#11150).
    - SkippedContent warning if table directive contains non-tabular content.
    - Simple tables: leading space in a cell should not cause the contents to be parsed as a block quote (#11146).
    - Parse :alt: on figure (#11140). Also give a better default if alt is not specified, using the stringified caption rather than the filename.
    - Support col spans for simple tables (Tuong Nguyen Manh).
  - Markdown writer:
    - Improve handling of implicit figures (#11140). Allow implicit figures when alt text differs from caption (in this case, we use an image attribute to add the alt).
    - Use approximate pipe tables when it’s the only option (#11128). If we have a table with row/colspans that can rendered as an approximate pipe table (without row/colspans), and no other table format is enabled that could render the table, we fall back to an “approximate” pipe table, with no row/colspans.
  - RST writer:
    - Ensure blank line before directives (#11162).
    - Add col spans for simple tables (#10127, Tuong Nguyen Manh).
  - OpenDocument writer:
    - Add missing table elements (#10002, Tuong Nguyen Manh). Add missing header rows after the first one, footer rows as well as TableBody header rows.
  - Docx writer:
    - Fix regression (from 3.8) in highlighted code (#11156).
  - Powerpoint writer:
    - Handle single column (Tuong Nguyen Manh).
  - Typst writer:
    - Fix syntax highlighting (#11171, completes #10525). Previously the native typst highlighting was always used, regardless of the setting of --syntax-highlighting. With this change, --syntax-highlighting=none and --syntax-highlighting=<stylename> (with skylighting style) will work.
  - LaTeX writer:
    - Make beamer footnotes compatible with pauses (#5954). Previously they would appear before the content to which the note was attached, when there were pauses in a slide.
    - Avoid \_ in bibliography variable (#11152).
    - Ensure that unlabelled tables don’t increment counter (#11141).
    - Protect VERB in caption (#11139, Tuong Nguyen Manh).
    - Don’t add links to TOC (#11124, Albert Krewinkel).
    - Fix strikeouts in beamer title (#11168, Tuong Nguyen Manh).
  - LaTeX template: Add shorthands variable for LaTeX output (#11160). If true, pandoc will allow language-specific shorthands when loading babel. (This is helpful, for example, in getting proper spacing around French punctuation.)
  - epub.css: Remove coloring for a, a:visiting (#11174). This was causing links in iOS books app not to be distinguished in any way (since underlining is not used there).
  - Text.Pandoc.Parsing:
    - [API chage] (Tuong Nguyen Manh). New functions tableWithSpans, tableWithSpans', toTableComponentsWithSpans and toTableComponentsWithSpans' take a list of lists of (Blocks, RowSpan, ColSpan) to parse a Table with different RowSpan and ColSpan values accordingly. New helper functions singleRowSpans and singleColumnSpans help set all RowSpans or ColSpans to be 1 in case the table format only allows setting one or the other.
  - Text.Pandoc.Class:
    - Let fetchItem fail if the HTTP request is not successful (Albert Krewinkel). HTTP requests that don’t return a 200 error code are now treated as an error. This ensures that a warning is triggered when using --embed-resources or --extract-media.
  - Text.Pandoc.Writers.Shared:
    - Add new function removeLinks [API change] (Albert Krewinkel). The function converts links to spans. It is used, for example, to avoid nested links. The HTML writer used to put the description of nested links into small caps, but uses a simple span now.
  - Text.Pandoc.Highlighting: export typst functions [API change]. New exported functions formatTypstBlock, formatTypstInline, styleToTypst.
  - Text.Pandoc.XML:
    - Add fetchpriority to list of HTML attributes (#11176).
  - Allow unicode-data 0.7.
  - Use released djot 0.1.2.3. Fixes a bug in which indentation was swallowed in a code block inside a blockquote.
