ReleaseNotes: |-
    I'm pleased to announce the release of pandoc 3.8.2,
    available in the usual places:
    Binary packages & changelog:

    Source & API documentation:
    http://hackage.haskell.org/package/pandoc-3.8.2
    This release fixes a regression in the typst template (since 3.8), which caused links to be omitted.
    It also adds a new default Markdown extension, `table_attributes`, which allows attributes to be added to tables by putting them after the caption.
    API change: Add `Ext_table_attributes` constructor to Extension.
    Of special note:
        - Markdown reader/writer: implement new `table_attributes` extension
        (#10884). When `table_attributes` is enabled (as it is by default for
        pandoc's Markdown), attributes can be attached to a table by
        including them at the end of the caption. Previously the writer
        would emit an identifier in this position, but the reader didn't
        handle it. Now arbitrary attributes are allowed, and they work in
        both the reader and writer.
       - Typst writer: don't add superfluous semicolons (#11196).
        Previously we added semicolons after inline commands not
        followed by spaces, but mainly this was to deal with one issue:
        the presence of a semicolon after an inline command, which
        would be swallowed as a command separator (#9252).
        This commits adopts an approach that should avoid so many
        superfluous semicolons: it escapes semicolons that might come
        right after a command.
      - Typst template: fix 3.8 regression in which links disappear
        (#11194). A template change in 3.8 added a show rule for links which
        causes them to disappear except in special cases.
      - Text.Pandoc.Parsing: rewrite `oneOfStrings` more efficiently.
      - LaTeX writer: Fix strikeout in links (#11192, Tuong Nguyen Manh).
        As in #1294 `\url` and `\href` need to be protected
        inside an mbox for `soul` commands.
      - Text.Pandoc.Extensions: Add `Ext_table_attributes` constructor for
        `Extension` [API change].
      * Use released texmath 0.13.0.1.
      * Update FSF contact information in COPYING (#11183, Bensun Muite).

      - MANUAL.txt: remove some redundancy (#11178, Reuben Thomas).
