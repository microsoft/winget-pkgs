ReleaseNotes: |-
  Onfortunately, there were 2 nasty errors in the original 696 version. One had to do with the auto
  http setting. In many cases that the auto http was "on", starting the program just created a crash.
  The other had to do with an occasional buffer overflow.
  Anyway, in the current version some cleaning up was done and next to fixing these errors some issues
  in the packet handling (for EPG/SPI) were solved.

  Since apparently not in all PC''s there is a CPU that supports avx2 instructions, so there are two
  versions made, one using the avx2 instructions and one that does not.

  The documentation is updated for 696.
  Most visible changes are in the configuration and control window, some settings were removed and
  some settings were added.
  One of the changes invisible in the GUI, is the way slides are saved, now within a directory labeled
  with the Eid in a subdirectory labeled with the service name

  As always, comments are welcome, One request though: if there is an issue, please specify version and
  platform
