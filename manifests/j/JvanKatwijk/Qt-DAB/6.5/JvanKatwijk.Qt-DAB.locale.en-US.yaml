ReleaseNotes: |-
  Qt_DAB-6 5-2After some time indicating the version as Beta. it is now time to freeze the functionality and move on.
  Copared to the most recent Beta version there are not mmany changes.The changes are such that maintaining V4 was not realistic, saving V5 succeeded.
  As usual (for some time now) there are two 32 bit windows versions, one with support for V4 dabsticks (which seems to
  make the software a little deaf when using older type dabsticks) and one for support for V3.The 64 bit Windows version is compiled with V4 support in. The known issue is that in this versions not all types of slide can be displayed.Further development will be done in the version in the directory "qt-dab-RC"
