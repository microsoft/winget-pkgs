Description: |-
  ASF is a C# application with primary purpose of farming Steam cards from multiple accounts simultaneously.
  Unlike Idle Master which works only for one account at given time, while requiring Steam client running in the background and launching additional processes imitating "game playing" status, ASF doesn't require any Steam client running in the background, doesn't launch any additional processes and is made to handle unlimited Steam accounts at once.
  In addition to that, it's meant to be run on servers or other desktop-less machines, and features full cross-OS support, which makes it possible to launch on any operating system with .
  NET Core runtime, such as Windows, Linux and macOS.
  ASF is possible thanks to gigantic amount of work done in marvelous SteamKit2 library.

  Changelog
  Changes since V6.1.2.3:
  - Added inventory [Bots] command and ASF API endpoint for fetching inventory summary (@JustArchi #3378).
  - Added ASF API endpoint for fetching inventory of selected bots (@JustArchi #3378).
  - Internal cleanups in regards to ASF API swagger generation, the underlying schema has changed (@JustArchi #3343, #3376).
  - Internal cleanups in regards to ASF html parsing (@JustArchi #3184).
  - Latest ASF-ui with new features, improvements and bugfixes (@MrBurrBurr).
  - Updated localization provided by our community (@JustArchi-ArchiBot).
  - Usual amount of other core improvements, optimizations and bugfixes (@JustArchi).
  Changes for plugin creators:
  - ASF is moving away from XPath parsing to native css selectors. If you're currently depending on AngleSharp.XPath or using ASF's html parser helpers such as SelectNodes() or SelectSingleNode() then you'll need to rewrite them into css selectors equivalents. See the referenced task for more details and examples, the XPath library and ASF helpers will be removed in the next version (@JustArchi #3184).
  - As announced in the previous stable, swashbuckle was removed for swagger generation. If you're still using swagger annotations, you'll need to rewrite them into OpenAPI equivalents (@JustArchi #3343, #3376).
