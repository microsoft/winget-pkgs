Description: |-
  ASF is a C# application with primary purpose of farming Steam cards from multiple accounts simultaneously.
  Unlike Idle Master which works only for one account at given time, while requiring Steam client running in the background and launching additional processes imitating "game playing" status, ASF doesn't require any Steam client running in the background, doesn't launch any additional processes and is made to handle unlimited Steam accounts at once.
  In addition to that, it's meant to be run on servers or other desktop-less machines, and features full cross-OS support, which makes it possible to launch on any operating system with .
  NET Core runtime, such as Windows, Linux and macOS.
  ASF is possible thanks to gigantic amount of work done in marvelous SteamKit2 library.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Changelog
  Changes since V6.1.7.8:
  - ⚠️ This release includes breaking change of NLog v6 update (@JustArchi #3438).
  - - For ASF with default logging, archival logs files are saved under different suffix now. ASF will cleanup old suffix files automatically upon creating new logs, although not in the expected order. No action is required from you.
  - - For custom logging, i.e. using NLog.config, you should review NLog 6.0 major changes, as there are some underlying library changes, especially in regards to File target. You might need to update your NLog.config, as old configs may not be compatible with the new settings. We've also updated our wiki to have compatible examples to aid you with that.
  - ASF will now automatically dismiss new trade restriction message when needed, i.e. when sending/receiving non-Steam items through built-in functionalities such as loot or master trade offers (@JustArchi).
  - Improved speed of MatchActively matching, especially when a lot of potential users are found (@JustArchi).
  - Fixed very rare ASF crash when redeeming key with no info returned, despite successful attempt (@JustArchi).
  - Fixed very rare ASF crash when handling some store-only packages (@JustArchi).
  - Latest ASF-ui with new features, improvements and bugfixes (@MrBurrBurr).
  - Updated localization provided by our community (@JustArchi-ArchiBot).
  - Usual amount of other core improvements, optimizations and bugfixes (@JustArchi).
  Changes for developers:
  - JetBrains.Annotations library that we're using got splitted into two, so we're now using JetBrains.Annotations.Sources. You might need to correct your dependencies if you've previously referenced it in your plugins (@JustArchi).
