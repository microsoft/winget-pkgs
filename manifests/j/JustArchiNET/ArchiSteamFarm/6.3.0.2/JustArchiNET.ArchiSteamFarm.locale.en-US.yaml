Description: |-
  ASF is a C# application with primary purpose of farming Steam cards from multiple accounts simultaneously.
  Unlike Idle Master which works only for one account at given time, while requiring Steam client running in the background and launching additional processes imitating "game playing" status, ASF doesn't require any Steam client running in the background, doesn't launch any additional processes and is made to handle unlimited Steam accounts at once.
  In addition to that, it's meant to be run on servers or other desktop-less machines, and features full cross-OS support, which makes it possible to launch on any operating system with .
  NET Core runtime, such as Windows, Linux and macOS.
  ASF is possible thanks to gigantic amount of work done in marvelous SteamKit2 library.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Changelog
  Changes since V6.2.3.1:
  Breaking changes:
  - ASF is now based on .NET 10, which opens a new V6.3 release family. As usual, generic users will require .NET 10 upgrade, OS-specific users are covered by our built-in runtime. .NET 10 brings a lot of under-the-hood features, bugfixes and other improvements (@JustArchi #3482).
  - ASF_USER is no longer recognized in our docker images - use ASF_UID instead, see wiki for more info. Rebuilding containers is recommended for all docker setups (@JustArchi).
  Core:
  - When redeeming keys, ASF will now move to the next bot in Distributing scenario also when key is invalid, if KeepMissingGames was disabled - enable that switch if you'd like previous behaviour in this case (@JustArchi).
  - Latest ASF-ui with new features, improvements and bugfixes (@MrBurrBurr).
  - Updated localization provided by our community (@JustArchi-ArchiBot).
  - Usual amount of other core improvements, optimizations and bugfixes (@JustArchi).
  Changes for plugin creators:
  - ASF is based on .NET 10 now. It's recommended to update all plugins to target latest version of ASF due to that, although .NET 10 on its own doesn't cause existing plugins to stop working (@JustArchi).
  - The main requirement apart from the basics is a required reference to Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi if you want to build ASF as part of the source tree. See plugin template update for a working example and more info (@JustArchi).
