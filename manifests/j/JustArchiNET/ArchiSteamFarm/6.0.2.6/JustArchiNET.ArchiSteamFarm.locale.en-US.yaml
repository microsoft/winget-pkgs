Description: |-
  ASF is a C# application with primary purpose of farming Steam cards from multiple accounts simultaneously.
  Unlike Idle Master which works only for one account at given time, while requiring Steam client running in the background and launching additional processes imitating "game playing" status, ASF doesn't require any Steam client running in the background, doesn't launch any additional processes and is made to handle unlimited Steam accounts at once.
  In addition to that, it's meant to be run on servers or other desktop-less machines, and features full cross-OS support, which makes it possible to launch on any operating system with .
  NET Core runtime, such as Windows, Linux and macOS.
  ASF is possible thanks to gigantic amount of work done in marvelous SteamKit2 library.

ReleaseNotes: "Changelog\nChanges since V6.0.1.24:- Added GET /HealthCheck ASF API endpoint for those that would like to monitor uptime of their ASF instance with minimal overhead, the endpoint does not require authorization (@JustArchi).\n- Improved update procedure for ASF and plugins which should decrease amount of accidental corruptions (@JustArchi #3182 #3156).\n- Official Monitoring plugin, as announced in the previous release, is now available for general usage, with dedicated wiki page for more info, such as example grafana dashboard (@JustArchi @Abrynos).\n- Official plugins will now allow its updates only to matching ASF version (@JustArchi).\n- Removed --process-required command-line argument, it's default ASF behaviour now - ASF no longer shuts down when no bots are running.\n- Added new ShutdownIfPossible global config property for those that prefer previous behaviour in regards to --process-required before its removal (@JustArchi).\n- Fixed IWebInterface plugins with WebPath: / causing IPC failure to start (@JustArchi).\n- Misc docker enhancements, such as full provenance support (@JustArchi).\n- Latest ASF-ui with new features, improvements and bugfixes (@MrBurrBurr).\n- Updated localization provided by our community (@JustArchi-ArchiBot).\n- Usual amount of other core improvements, optimizations and bugfixes (@JustArchi).\nChanges for plugin creators:- ASF generates sessionid differently now. This shouldn't be of any interest for vast majority if not every plugin developer out there, however, if by any chance you've previously assumed implementation detail of how ASF generates session IDs, then you need to review that assumption, as session IDs generated by ASF are no longer derived from steam IDs (@JustArchi \n\nSupport\nASF is available for free, this release was made possible thanks to the people that decided to support the project.
