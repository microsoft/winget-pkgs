Description: |-
  ASF is a C# application with primary purpose of farming Steam cards from multiple accounts simultaneously.
  Unlike Idle Master which works only for one account at given time, while requiring Steam client running in the background and launching additional processes imitating "game playing" status, ASF doesn't require any Steam client running in the background, doesn't launch any additional processes and is made to handle unlimited Steam accounts at once.
  In addition to that, it's meant to be run on servers or other desktop-less machines, and features full cross-OS support, which makes it possible to launch on any operating system with .
  NET Core runtime, such as Windows, Linux and macOS.
  ASF is possible thanks to gigantic amount of work done in marvelous SteamKit2 library.

  Changelog
  Changes since V6.1.2.2:
  - Fixed crash during login procedure on some macOS setups (@JustArchi #3381).
  Changes since V6.1.1.3:
  - ASF will no longer allow to run with invalid IPCPassword in regards to IPCPasswordFormat. Previously it'd silently crash during ASF API requests (@JustArchi).
  - Latest ASF-ui with new features, improvements and bugfixes (@MrBurrBurr).
  - Updated localization provided by our community (@JustArchi-ArchiBot).
  - Usual amount of other core improvements, optimizations and bugfixes (@JustArchi).
  Changes for plugin creators:
  - We're preparing to replace our current Swashbuckle swagger generation with OpenAPI. There was already attempt during this release cycle at #3343, however, it was reverted due to outstanding issues found with such approach: #3376 (@JustArchi).
  - For now, ensure that your project does not depend on Swashbuckle.*. Existing PackageReference should be removed from all plugins. All current annotations should be rewritten into OpenAPI standard, which is compatible with both old and new generator. Check MSDN for overview of valid attributes that you can use.
  - If you're feeling brave and want to see how your plugin behaves with the new generator, #3376 mentions a possibility in this release to enable it through undocumented otherwise feature switch. Please note however that due to issues mentioned, it's not ready yet for production.
  - Removed functionalities deprecated in the previous release (@JustArchi).
