ReleaseNotes: |-
  Difftastic is a structural diff tool that understands syntax. See the manual to get started, and the changelog for historical changes.
  Build
  Incrased the default page size of Jemalloc, so difftastic should work on systems with large page sizes (typically aarch64, i.e. Arm).
  difftastic now requires Rust 1.75 to build.
  Parsing
  Updated Clojure, Common Lisp, Rust and Zig parsers. Improved parsing of Kotlin.
  Text encoding detection is now stricter, fixing more cases where binary files were treated as text.
  Added the --override-binary option to force files to be treated as binary rather than text.
  Display
  When diffing binary files, the file sizes are now shown to help see big changes.
