ReleaseNotes: |-
  Difftastic is a structural diff tool that understands syntax. See the manual to get started, and the changelog for historical changes.
  Diffing
  When diffing directories, difftastic now ignores the .git directory.
  Display
  Fixed an issue where --display=side-by-side-show-both would not use a two-column display when one file was empty.
  Command Line Interface
  Difftastic no longer accepts the --missing-as-empty argument. This argument has had no effect since 0.46.
  Parsing
  File detection now supports Windows-1252 encoded text (an extension of ISO-8859-1), and is stricter about UTF-16 detection.
  Updated to the latest tree-sitter parser for Elixir, LaTeX, Make, Nix, Rust and YAML.
  Build
  Releases now include prebuilt musl binaries.
