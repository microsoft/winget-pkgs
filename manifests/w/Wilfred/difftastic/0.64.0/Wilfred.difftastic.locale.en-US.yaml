ReleaseNotes: |-
  Difftastic is a structural diff tool that understands syntax. See the manual to get started, and the changelog for historical changes.
  Parsing
  Updated to the latest tree-sitter parser for Erlang, F#, Gleam, Pascal and Swift.
  File detection is now stricter for UTF-8, and recognises more compression file types as binary (e.g. zstd or bzip2).
  Added support for Verilog and SystemVerilog.
  Build
  CI on GitHub now uses Ubuntu 22.04 for Linux builds (previously Ubuntu 20.04), so prebuilt binaries will require a newer glibc version to run.
  Internal
  Difftastic has switched from MiMalloc to Jemalloc for allocation. This is modest performance regression (up to 20% longer runtime in testing). Jemalloc is currently easier to build (see issue #805) and has fewer pathological performance corner cases.
