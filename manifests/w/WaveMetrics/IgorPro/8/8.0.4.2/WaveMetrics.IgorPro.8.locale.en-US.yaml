  IGOR APPLICATION
  CHANGED BEHAVIOR
  - The maximum number of points in a wave and maximum size of a wave's data has increased by a factor of 10.
  - When an experiment is opened, if a global variable root:Packages:V_openedExperiment exists, its value is set to 1. You can use this to decide whether to initialize something that needs to be started when the experiment is opened. See also: AfterCompiledHook, AfterFileOpenHook, and IgorStartOrNewHook. This behavior also extends to the immediate subfolders in root:Packages, for example root:Packages:YourPackage:V_openedExperiment, etc.
  - When using ModifyGraph fill to next mode (mode=7) and individual setting for plus and minus fills, the fill type "none" is now honored. Previously it had been erroneously filling with white.
  BUG FIXES
  - Macintosh: Improved font organization so that font sets like Goudy Old Style no longer need multiple font families.
  - Fixed a problem where the code symbols popups in procedure windows weren't updating during text editing until procedures were compiled.
  - Fixed display of complex variable values in the Data Browser info panel when browsing an experiment.
  - Fixed a crash if you used the LoadWave /ENCG={textEncoding,tecOptions} flag in a pre-emptive thread.
