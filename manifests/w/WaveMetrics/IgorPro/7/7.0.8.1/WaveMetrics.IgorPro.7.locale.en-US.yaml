  IGOR APPLICATION
  BUG FIXES
  - Fixed crash that occurs when clicking a user-defined control that calls a structure-based action procedure after procedures are recompiled. See Control Structures for examples. This bug occurs only in Igor 7.07, and is serious enough to warrant an immediate update.
  - Fixed bug where TileWindows sometimes returned an error if a procedure window was visible.
