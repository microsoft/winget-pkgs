  Notable Changes in Igor Pro 9.05
  IGOR APPLICATION
  BUG FIXES
  - Fixed LoadData using an invalid wave name when loading a large wave with a long wave name.
  - Fixed a bug in which copying a large amount of data to the clipboard could cause Igor to quit (after giving the user a chance to save the experiment).
  - Fixed a wave assignment bug when run on the command line while leaving some indices unspecified. For example, a wave assignment to a 3D wave where only the row and column were specified.
  - Igor Tex now correctly displays an expression that starts with a superscript or subscript such as:
    TextBox/C/N=text0 "\\$WMTEX$ ^{3}\\Delta_{u} \\$/WMTEX$"
  PROCEDURES
  New Polar Graphs package:
  - Fixed problems introduced in 9.04 that rendered the New Polar Graph panel non-functional. Improved behavior of valueAtCenter for negative radii.
