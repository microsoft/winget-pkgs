ShortDescription: WsWin - Weatherstation Operation and Data Acquisition Software
Description: WsWin - This Software was written originally for the ELV-Wireless-Interface WS2000-PC V2.x (also OEM-Versions from Huger, Conrad and others are available), whereby in additon, still the old Interfaces are supported - I think, it is the only software, which can still act this interface in this way. The Weatherstations from Huger/OSI WMR-918/968 und WM-918 are also supported, the VantagePro/VantageVUE from DAVIS and the TE923 / Irox PRO-X / Honeywell TE923W / NetAtmo. This software supports the wetterarchiv.de project, the the Wunderground weatherstation project too and AWEKAS and more. This software is for the ELV/Huger/La Crosse Interfaces WS2000 (V2.x) and WS2500 (V3.x), the Huger/OSI Weather Stations WMR-918/928/968, WM-918 and/or DAVIS Weather Station VantagePro/VantageVUE (with Weatherlink file or online), TE923/Irox PRO-X (Mebus, Irox, Honeywell, Cresta, RST), NEXUS (TFA), TN924 (Honeywell) and is in the not registered Version limited. Without registration it read all data from the datalogger, but the recording is limited to 180 minutes. The old ELV interfaces are supported without reservation by this software in the on-line operation. For those, which would like to regard the meteorological data of the Huger Weatherstation only on-line, this can be done without limitation.
