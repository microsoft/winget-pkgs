ReleaseNotes: |
  🎉 Welcome to the release of the sixth generation of Waterfox. This release further enhances your privacy while browsing the web.
  Changes in G6.0.2

    Critical security fix.
    Waterfox has re-introduced the ability to change the behaviour of “click to select all” in the address bar, removed by Firefox.
        Typically, when you click on the address bar, whatever is in there is automatically selected.
            You can treat the address bar as a standard input field by toggling `browser.urlbar.clickSelectsAll` to `false` in `about:config`.
            With the above set to false, you can enable a double click to select all by setting `browser.urlbar.doubleClickSelectsAll` to `true`.
  Changes in G6.0.1

    Update privacy preferences.
        Fixes issues with logging into websites that use a referrer.
        Use standard tracking protection for now, to prevent issues with logging in.
        Modify samesite rules so they’re strict on non-http websites.
        Remove Firefox view tour prompt.
    Fixed an issue with language packs not working correctly.
    Added support for Windows Long Paths. Thanks to @goodusername123
    Prevent new searches and opening bookmarks from opening in a new tab by default.

  New Features

    Waterfox uses DNS over Oblivious HTTP, a privacy preserving method for DNS queries.
    You can now move and remove the extension button from the navigation bar.
        Access this via Menu > More tools > Customize toolbar…
    Waterfox is now built with new optimisation techniques, giving you a faster browsing experience.
    Linux, alongside Windows, now supports DRM. That means you can watch your favourite shows on the streaming platform of your choice.

  Changes

    Waterfox’s preferences have been gone through with a fine tooth comb, with a lot of assistance from yokoffing, who maintains Betterfox.js.

  Upcoming Changes

    Waterfox for Android’s feature set has been finalised, but requires updating to the latest components. This is in progress and is due for release. iOS is now in the pipeline as well.
    Privacy enhancements to some of the most popular search engines (wink wink, nudge nudge) are also in the pipeline, with more to be revealed soon.
