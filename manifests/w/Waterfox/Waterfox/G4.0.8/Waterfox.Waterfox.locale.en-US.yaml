  New
  • Added a toggle on about:preferences to force light/dark mode with Lepton theme.

  Fixed
  • Private tab will now correctly not store search suggestions and recently closed tabs.
  • Private tab icon will now only appear in Lepton theme, so should no longer appear on themes that do not have context menu icons.
  • Forcing dark mode in Lepton with ui.systemUsesDarkTheme on Linux distros should now work.

  Unresolved
  • Addon version numbers are not displayed next to their title in about:addons.
  • Auto updates can still not be completely stopped. PR is ready but we are just doing additional checks to ensure nothing breaks.
