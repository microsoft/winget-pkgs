ReleaseNotes: |
  Changes
    You can now disable Oblivious DNS via the Preferences page. Go to `about:preferences` → `Privacy & Security` → `DNS over HTTPS`.
    The Linux tarball now extracts into a subdirectory named `waterfox`, rather than into the current directory.
    Waterfox will no longer decode URLs when copying them. This should allow easier sharing.
  Fixes
    On pages that try to load mixed content, Waterfox will attempt to upgrade non secure content.
    When closing multiple tabs to the left or right, Waterfox will now show the correct close dialogue.
    If DNS requests take too long, Waterfox will fallback to your default DNS much quicker.
