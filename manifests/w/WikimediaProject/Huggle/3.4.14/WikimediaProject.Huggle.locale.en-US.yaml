ReleaseNotes: |-
  Downloads
  Windows:
  Both packages are built using Visual Studio and require Administrator rights for installation, because they install vcredist packages (Visual Studio C++ redistributable package, containing libraries needed when running software compiled in Visual Studio).
  These packages are created using Qt5, previous build was done using Qt6 but clearly had some issues, so we decided not to take the risks this time.
  - 32 bit: Built using VS 2019 / Qt 5.15.2
  - 64 bit: Built using VS 2019 / Qt 5.15.2
  Linux:
  It's recommended to compile Huggle yourself. There are also snapcraft packages, that may however be outdated.
  MacOS:
  We provide packages for Intel x86_64 and ARM (Apple Silicon).
  - ARM: built on Sonoma 14.4 using Qt 6.7.2
  - Intel: built on Monterey 12.6.3 using Qt 5.15.2
