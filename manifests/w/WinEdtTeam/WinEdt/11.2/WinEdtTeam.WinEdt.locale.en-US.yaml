ShortDescription: WinEdt is a powerful and versatile Unicode (UTF8) text editor for Windows.
Description: |-
  It is commonly used as a front-end (Integrated Development Environment) for
  compilers and typesetting systems, such as LaTeX, HTML, or NSIS. WinEdt's
  highlighting schemes can be customized for different modes and its
  spell-checking functionality supports multilingual setups, with dictionaries
  (word lists) for over 20 languages available on Downloads page.

  Although reasonably suitable as an all-purpose text editor, WinEdt is mostly
  used as a LaTeX Editor. It was designed and configured to integrate seamlessly
  with modern TeX Systems (e.g. MiKTeX or TeX Live).
