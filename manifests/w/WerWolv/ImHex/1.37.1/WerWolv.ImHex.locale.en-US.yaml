  Previous Version
  Features
  - ImHex now properly supports HiDPI scaling on Windows, macOS and Linux!
  - ImHex now uses the native menu bar on macOS
  - You can now set separate fonts for the main UI, the Hex Editor and the Pattern Editor
  - Added a new ARM64 AppImage release as well as a WebAssembly release to self-host ImHexWeb
  - ImHex can now be fully compiled using MSVC and ClangCL on Windows! Huge thanks to @mrexodia
    - The main releases are still built with MinGW but this should hopefully make it easier to contribute to ImHex!
  - We now provide build attestation for each build generated through our CI so you can verify exactly from which run an artifact has been built
  - Added initial support for custom disassemblers
    - This lets you define disassemblers for custom instruction sets using a simple JSON format
  - Added messaging support for macOS and Linux
    - This allows you to use ImHex as a command line tool on macOS and Linux to control the currently open ImHex instance
    - For example imhex --open "SomeFile.bin" --select 0x100 0x200 will open the SomeFile.bin file in the current instance and then select addresses 0x100 to 0x200
  - Added Russian translation! Huge thanks to @Lemon4ksan
  - Added a title bar backdrop color gradients and accent colors
  - Added utf16 and utf32 string and char types
  - Added option to randomize window title
    - In case some stupid anti-cheat is trying to detect ImHex in the future :)
  - Added new --select, --pattern and --debug-mode subcommands
  - Added support for OpenGL post processing shaders
    - This lets you load custom shaders now by placing a shader.vert and shader.frag file in one of the ImHex resource folders.
    - These shaders can apply any post processing to the rendered image
  - Added New File option to the GNOME launcher and a --new cli option
  - Added support for scanning binaries for UTF-8 strings
  - Added visibility toggle to hide bookmark highlighting
  - Added option to fit hex columns to screen width
  - Added setting to disable hex editor highlights entirely
  - Added a preview to the Edit -> Copy as options
  - Added "Jump to address" option to data inspector row context menu
  - Added option to change radix of numbers in hex editor view
  - Added context menu and next/previous buttons to the data inspector
  - Added option to move selection back to hex editor footer
  - Added option to copy data as escaped string
  - Added shortcut for Copy as -> Custom Encoding
  Improvements
  - Replaced the Windows and Linux app icon with the one from the Papyrus Icon Project!
  - The DMG on macOS now looks a lot nicer than before
  - Revamped the frame rate limiting system to make ImHex feel much less laggy by default and make it use less CPU resources
  - ImHex now uses Jetbrains Mono as its default font instead of the ImGui default font
  - The settings window can now be resized
  - The ImHex window is now hidden on macOS when close button is pressed
  - Allowed all highlights to overlap each other
  - Allowed the favorite column in the pattern data view to be hidden
  - Allowed command palette to be closed by clicking on the menu bar
  - All installed content store items are now force updated after an ImHex update
