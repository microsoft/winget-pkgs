ReleaseNotes: |-
  A lot of new features since last stable version: RISCV Support, new Runners (WCGI), API convergence for JS/SYS, and WASI eXtended.
  - RISCV support, on both Cranelift and LLVM Compiler.
  - New Runners, with WCGI as a new one
  - Most WAPM command are now available on the wasmer CLI directly
  - Using Wasmer on sys or js backend is more transparent now, with now support for running wasmer onJavaScriptCore
  - The WASI implementation has undergone a major refactoring, and will continue evolve significantly over the coming months.
    - The old wasmer_wasi crate was deprecated.
    - To continue using WASI, please switch to the new wasmer_wasix crate, which follows a different versioning scheme than the main Wasmer releases. Major changes:
    - An async runtime is now required. The runtime is pluggable, but only tokio is officially supported at the moment.
    - The virtual file system layer was renamed from wasmer-vfs to virtual-fs, and now is built around an async interface that builds on top of tokio::{AsyncRead/Write}
  This refactor will unlock many exciting new features that will be announced soon! Just be aware that you will have to expect some instability and frequent releases with potential breaking changes until our new implementation settles. down.
