ReleaseNotes: |-
  The Chromium base was updated from 126.0.6478.249 to 126.0.6478.259 to reflect the ESR patches in that period. This may help with a few issues that were not tied to a Supermium-specific problem, such as random renderer crashes on Windows 7.

  Other changes are as follows:
  - (#760 and others) removed loader deadlock in memory partition area on Windows 7
  - (#915) added option to disable Crashpad, ``--disable-crashpad``
  - (#588) changing default behaviour for icon loading on download page due to excessive process creation and poorer variety of icons. Use ``--force-generic-download-icons`` to restore this functionality.
  - (#898) added double click to close tabs feature from Thorium, ``--double-click-close-tab``
  - (#946) crash when adding bookmarks while ``--no-sync`` in use, is fixed
  - (#916) PDF loading bug on Windows 7 fixed, with change in fallback font from Arial to Arial Unicode MS
  - (#937) Patcher introduced for Widevine CDM on Windows 7. It is located in the base Supermium directory and is named ``win7_fixwidevine.cmd``. It is based on the default user data location, users with a non-default user data directory will have to change it accordingly. Use each time a new Widevine release has been downloaded (there are no auto-updates for integrity reasons, so this should only need to be done sparingly).
  - (#912, #955) hashes are now available in SHA2-256 and SHA3-512 format for each file in the Releases directory
  - (#906) ``--history-journeys`` and ``--side-panel-journeys`` restored
  - (#871) Dark mode implementation fixed and duplicate options removed, replaced with unique options
  - (#899) Zip distribution added for XP users who may not be able to run the installer due to error 6 (OS issue if persistent)
