ReleaseNotes: |-
  This is the final release in the Supermium 126 series. Supermium will be bumped to version 132 in February. In version 132, some user interface changes are expected visibly, while many others will be made under-the-hood.

  - (#1101) User agent mismatch corrected, version bumped up to 132
  - Fixed crash in optimization guide when ungoogled-supermium enabled
  - (#1110) User metric data creation disabled. This data was never transmitted to LSC, but may have been transmitted to Google, and only if ``--ungoogled-supermium`` was not enabled.
  - (#1114) SSSE3 support restored for WASM
  - (#1090) DirectWrite cache data is now placed in the Supermium directory instead of AppData
