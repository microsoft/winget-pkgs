ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Fixes the "proprietary" and "proprietary fixed" behavior for BacLink configurations. These values control which details a user is permitted to edit based on the "file structure" setting.
  - Treat "0" as a missing result in BacLink (as if the value were empty) unless the corresponding setting to "treat 0mm as 6mm" is enabled.
  - Corrects a problem reading InFARM file headers when loading a sample data file.
  - Use the same sort sequence that WHONET uses for BacLink's list of available data field modules.
  - Adds support for SQLite code lists and dictionaries in BacLink.
  - Adds the ability to ignore codes permanently during BacLink code mapping.
  - Adds the "Surveillance Program" field to InFARM configurations. This field is intended to be set to a fixed value by the user (information not available in the source data file).
