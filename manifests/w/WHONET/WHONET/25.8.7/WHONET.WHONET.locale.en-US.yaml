ReleaseNotes: |-
  WHO GLASS - Changes the way the samples file statistics are calculated. Samples values now match the RIS file''s behavior of ''first isolate per patient per data stratification''.
  Corrects the Enterococcus Gentamicin breakpoint by eliminating the intermediate range in favor of resistant and susceptible only. Consult the CLSI or EUCAST documentation for the proper interpretation of this test.
  Fix the vertical bar placement for disk ECOFFs in the %RIS analysis graphs.
  New laboratories will have animal and ECOFF breakpoints turned off by default.
  Improves the message displayed when an invalid WHONET file is selected.
  Corrects an issue with the GLASS AMR aggregated and individual exports related to invalid specimen types and language-dependent codes. Uses explicit numeric codes instead to remove the potential for the issue to occur.
  Reorder the main application file menu in WHONET.
