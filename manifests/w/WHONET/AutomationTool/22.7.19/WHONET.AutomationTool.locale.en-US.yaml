Description: |-
  The Automation Tool can be configured to execute an entire workflow of data processing, aggregation, and analysis steps.
  It includes optional services which either run on a set schedule, or are triggered in response to new files appearing in designated "watched" locations.
  You can configure any set of analyses you wish, from simple statistics to sophisticated outbreak detection.
  The system also has integrated process monitoring and email alerts for:
  • Missing input files
  • Duplicated input files
  • Lower- or higher-than-expected row counts
  • Lower- or higher-than-expected individual process runtimes
  • Duplicated row counts per institution on successive days
  • Error messages
  • Daily reports
