  What's Changed
  Compared to v2.2.0 this just fixes the macOS pre-built binary to include a few more libheif dependencies (AV1 codec support in particular). v2.2.0 release notes follow:
  New features:
  - support for new image formats: QOI, JPEG-XL, Ultra HDR jpegs, and HEIF/AVIF files (not in emscripten for now)
    - this even includes multi-image and auxiliary-channel support in JXL and HEIF/AVIF files, and HDR via PQ and HLG transfer functions
  - better support for ICC profiles and colorspaces via Little-CMS
  - extracting more image meta data during loading, which is displayed in the Info panel
  - the emscripten/web version supports opening files via drag-n-drop
  - the emscripten/web version has a loading screen as the program data is downloaded
  - the emscripten/web version now supports passing command-line arguments via URL query strings
  - can choose between multiple icon fonts during cmake configure
  Fixes:
  - fixed wasm crash when canceling file open
  - better support for local (system-installed) dependencies
  - fixed issue where mobile Safari would first convert all images to BMPs before loading (removing all HDR info)
  - pixel inspector color buttons now render correctly for grayscale + alpha channel groups
  Full Changelog: v2.1.0...v2.2.1
