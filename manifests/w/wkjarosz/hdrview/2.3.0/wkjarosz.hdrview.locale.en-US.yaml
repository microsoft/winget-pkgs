  What's Changed
  Major Feature Improvements
  1. Expanded file format support and metadata
     - With many "traditional" image formats now starting to add HDR support, it would be silly if a program named HDRView could not display those properly. HDRView now supports JPEG-XL, HEIF/HEIC, AVIF, PNG third edition, and UltraHDR JPEG images.
     - Support for loading all frames for some animated image formats: APNG (animated PNG), HEIF, AVIF, JPEG-XL
     - Now uses libpng (instead of stb_image) for PNG loading and saving, to support PNG (and APNG) third edition, and better color profile and metadata support.
     - HDRView now extracts and displays more metadata, including all EXIF data, and all fields in the EXR header
  2. Color Management and Chromaticity
     - HDRView is now fully color managed. It extracts and applies ICC profiles, chromaticities of primaries and whitepoint, and supports the recent coding-independent code points (CICP) for specifying pre-defined (HDR) color spaces.
     - The detected colorspace, primaries and white point are shown in the Info window by name, numerically, plotted on a CIE chromaticity diagram, and can be modified interactively. The whitepoint adaptation mode (none, Bradford, von Kries) can be chosen.
  3. Colormaps and tonemapping overhaul
     - The tone mapping mode can now be chosen from Gamma, Colormap (+), and Colormap (+/-).
     - The colormap modes allow choosing from a dozen or so popular colormaps (Viridis, Inferno, Turbo, etc.), including several diverging colormaps more suitable for visualizing positive/negative values.
       - Added a Python script for sampling and generating colormap data.
     - sRGB is no longer an option. All images are converted to the sRGB/BT.709 color gamut for display. The Gamma tonemapping value is applied in addition to the sRGB response curve.
  4. UI improvements
     - A new icon!
     - Added horizontal and vertical image flipping.
     - Added "fit selection" and "Auto fit selection" view commands.
     - Pixel statistics, histogram, and watched pixel values should now all be blend-mode aware
     - Added ability to load all images from a folder.
     - Can now reload a file, or all loaded files
     - Can "watch" loaded folders and images for changes and new files.
     - New zebra-stripe mode for showing pixels clipped pixel values
  Minor Updates and Fixes
  - updated to newest versions of Hello ImGui and dear imgui, and ImPlot.
  - made github workflow scripts more robust to package updates in github's runners
  - Added some more keyboard shortcuts, and menu icons
  - preliminary support for loading only some parts/channels of an image by matching against a text filter. Currently this is only used for reloading the correct part for multi-part images (since HDRView splits files with multiple parts into separate "images" shown in the interface)
  Full Changelog: v2.2.1...v2.3.0
  Released Files
  - Pre-built binary archive (.zip) for Microsoft Windows (extract in your desired location, and run HDRView.exe)
  - Pre-built dmg installer for Apple Silicon (HDRView-arm64.dmg) or Intel (HDRView-x86_64.dmg) Macs. Make sure to download the appropriate one for your architecture!
