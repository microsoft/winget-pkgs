ReleaseNotes: |-
  What's changed
  This release focuses on refinements to the UI and improvements to metadata extraction and display.
  - XMP parsing (via the TinyXML2 library)
    - In addition to displaying the raw XMP text, the parsed XMP data is now displayed in a tree structure much like EXIF data
  - Since the amount of metadata that HDRView extracts from images has increased, the Info panel now has a dropdown for which metadata to look at (General, Header, EXIF, XMP, Raw XMP data)
  - HDRView now extracts metadata and colorspace/ICC profile information for PSD images
  - Fixed an issue where PNG EXIF and XMP metadata wasn't being extracted properly
  - XMP metadata is now extracted from TIFF files
  - Minor layout/sizing tweaks to Help/About dialog
  Precompiled binaries for macOS, Windows, and Linux available below.
