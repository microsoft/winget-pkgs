  What's Changed
  Major Feature Improvements
  This release mainly has quality-of-life improvements:
  1. HDRView now has GUI themes. Choose from a dozen or so predefined themes, or customize and save your own. The theme is saved and restored on startup.
  2. This includes the ability to change the overall font size used in the GUI, which is also saved/restored.
  3. The size and position of the HDRView window is now also saved/restored.
  4. JPEG files are now loaded using libjpeg-turbo. This provides better metadata, and icc profile handling, including support for CMYK JPEGs.
  5. Improvements to the chromaticity diagram: better interaction support, support for zooming/panning, and the Plankian locus is shown
