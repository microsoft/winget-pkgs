  List of all downloads
  This point release fixes a severe multiplayer desync found in Widelands 1.3. Note that it is not possible to combine the versions 1.3 and 1.3.1 in a network game.
  Widelands is distributed for Windows (Intel 64-bit and 32-bit and Arm), Mac OS X ≥ 12.0 (Intel 64-bit and Arm), Linux (AppImage, 64 bit), and in source code. For Linux users, we also provide a Flatpak package and a Ubuntu PPA and try to make compiling as easy as possible, and most distributions will pick up Widelands 1.3.1 into their repositories very quickly. Both binary and source packages are available under the links below and from our Download page.
  If you like what you see, have a look around our homepage, https://www.widelands.org. You may also want to check the forums and our IRC channel, #widelands on LiberaChat, to arrange multiplayer games with other players.
  We especially welcome every helping hand: Help us find bugs, translate the game, add new scenarios or features! If you want to get even more involved in the further development of Widelands, you can meet us on the forum at https://www.widelands.org/ or subscribe to widelands-public@lists.sf.net on http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/widelands-public.
