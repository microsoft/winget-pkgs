  Since the release of version 1.2, we implemented several hundreds of new features and bugfixes; for example, to name just a few of the highlights:
  - Market trading
  - Six new maps added and three old maps removed
  - Economy districts
  - Many improvements to the in-game Encyclopedia
  - Download website maps as add-ons
  - New visualisation modes in the editor
  - Many new capabilities for add-on developers
  Widelands 1.3 is translated completely into Czech, Durch, German, Hungarian, and Low German, and the translations for 9 other languages are more than ⅔ complete.
  Widelands is distributed for Windows (Intel 64-bit and 32-bit, as well as Arm), Mac OS X ≥ 14.0 (Arm) and ≥ 15.0 (Intel), Linux (AppImage, 64 bit), and in source code. For Linux users, we also provide a Flatpak package and a Ubuntu PPA and try to make compiling as easy as possible, and most distributions will pick up Widelands 1.3 into their repositories very quickly. Both binary and source packages are available under the links below and from our Download page.
