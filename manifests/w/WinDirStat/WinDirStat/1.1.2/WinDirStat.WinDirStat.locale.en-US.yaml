ShortDescription: WinDirStat is a disk usage statistics viewer and cleanup tool for various versions of Microsoft Windows.
Description: |- 
  WinDirStat (Windows Directory Statistics) is a disk usage statistics viewer and cleanup tool for Windows. On start up, WinDirStat reads the whole directory tree once and then presents it in three useful views:
  - The directory list, which resembles the tree view of the Windows Explorer but is sorted by file/subtree size,
  - The treemap, which shows the whole contents of the directory tree straight away,
  - The extension list, which serves as a legend and shows statistics about the file types.
