ShortDescription: Disk usage statistics viewer and cleanup tool
Description: |-
  WinDirStat is a program that allows you to find disk space hogs at a glance. It achieves that by displaying a drive, drives or directories in a treemap that assigns bigger areas to bigger files and directories. Making those areas visually separate by coloring and other means allows you to see literally at a glance what the space hogs are and where to dig deeper.
  The directory tree is simultaneously shown as a tree list and as a treemap. One can effortlessly gain an impression of the proportions on the hard disk(s).
  
  Major features
    - Three views: Directory Tree, Treemap, and Extension
    - Duplicate file detection
    - Built-in cleanup actions including Open, Delete, Show Properties
    - User-defined cleanup actions (command line based)
