Description: Stratoshark lets you explore and analyze applications at the system call level using a mature, proven interface based on Wireshark. Created for the community by Sysdig. Stratoshark lets you explore and investigate the application-level behavior of your systems. You can capture system call and log activity and use a variety of advanced features to troubleshoot and analyze that activity. If you've ever used Wireshark, Stratoshark will look very familiar! It's a sibling application that shares the same dissection and filtering engine and much of the same user interface. It supports the same file format as Falco and Sysdig CLI, which lets you pivot seamlessly between each tool. As an added bonus, it's open source, just like Wireshark and Falco.
