ShortDescription: The world's most popular network protocol analyzer
Description: |-
  Wireshark is the world's foremost network protocol analyzer. It lets you see what's happening on your network at a microscopic level. It is the de facto (and often de jure) standard across many industries and educational institutions.
  Wireshark development thrives thanks to the contributions of networking experts across the globe. It is the continuation of a project that started in 1998.
