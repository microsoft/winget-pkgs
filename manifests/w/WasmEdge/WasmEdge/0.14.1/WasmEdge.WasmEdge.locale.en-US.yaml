      - Bump llama.cpp to b3651.
      - Static link libggml and libllama.
      - Refined the CMake to support multiple backends of WASI-NN with ggml backend.
      - Supported compute single in RPC mode.

  - [Plugin] Supported wasmedge_stablediffusion plug-in.
      - Enabled CUBLAS.
      - Enabled metal support on MacOS.
  - [Plugin] Moved wasi_logging into built-in plug-in.
      - Instead of installing wasi_logging plug-in shared library, developers can find and get this plug-in after calling WasmEdge_PluginLoadWithDefaultPaths() API.
      - In the WasmEdge CLI tools, the built-in plug-ins will automatically be loaded.
  - [Proposal] Initial support for instantiation phase of component model.
      - Due to the breaking change of API, bump the plug-in API_VERSION to 3.
  - [Proposal] Supported WASM Relaxed-SIMD proposal.
      - Added the WasmEdge_Proposal_RelaxSIMD for the configuration in WasmEdge C API.
      - Users can use the --enable-relaxed-simd to enable the proposal in wasmedge and wasmedgec tools.
  Fixed issues:
  - Fixed warnings on GCC-14.
  - Fixed the fmt related header inclusion for error logging.
  - Fixed WASI test error in Windows.
  - Fixed version checking in source tarball.
  - Fixed version detection issue when building from source.
  - Fixed the visibility of internal symbols.
  - [Loader] Fixed alignment checking in loading immediates for memory instructions.
  - [Runtime] Fixed allocation issue when configured the limited memory page size.
  - Used fmt::format instead of string stream in error logging.
  Tests:
  - Added WASI test suites on Windows.
  Known issues:
  - Universal WASM format failed on macOS platforms.
      - In the current status, the universal WASM format output of the AOT compiler with the O1 or upper optimizations on MacOS platforms will cause a bus error during execution.
      - We are trying to fix this issue. For a working around, please use the --optimize=0 to set the compiler optimization level to O0 in wasmedgec CLI.
