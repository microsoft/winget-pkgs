  Hotfix/Maintenance release
  Thanks @D1firehail for helping to prepare this release
  - Fix Lotus theme and Fix High Contrast themes, slightly adjust filter for it
  - Screenshot services use correct pixel format explicitly, fixing count item error with HDR
  - Add tesseract traineddata fallback location
  - Password for WFM should now be properly handled for all kinds of special characters
  - Switch to ProDotNetZip (thx D1firehail) to avoid vulnerability warnings for zipping debug archives
  - Fix various warnings of compiler
  - Switch to WFM v2 API for most of endpoints including Websocket (the only ones left v1 are the ones that don't have v2 equivalent yet)
  - Attempt to fix background work for Tesseract properly (less "long freeze" cases)
  - Switch to proper JSON serializer for all requests to make it robust against special characters
  - Start using wfinfo as device id to avoid logging off the Warframe Market WEB login session
  - Fix user-agent for most types of requests to help self-identify the WFInfo for WFM, Github and Cloudflare
  - Few minor tweaks for readability
  - Migrate from WebSocketSharp to Microsoft's Websockets as the other one is no longer maintained
  - Bi-directional sync of the WFM status via websocket
