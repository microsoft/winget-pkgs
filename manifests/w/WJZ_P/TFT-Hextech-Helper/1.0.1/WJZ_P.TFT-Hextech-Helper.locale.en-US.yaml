ShortDescription: Auto Chess Assistant Bot
Description: TFT Hextech Helper is a Teamfight Tactics auto-chess assistant developed using Electron + React + TypeScript. It can automatically play matches for you in Teamfight Tactics, freeing your hands so you can do other things while AFKing. (Of course, you won't be able to use your computer during AFK time, since the software will control your mouse!)
