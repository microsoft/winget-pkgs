  - Linux helper may get stuck when disconnecting on Raspberry Pi with split tunneling enabled.
  - openSUSE CLI install script not starting the helper service.
  - Auto-rotate MAC not working when disconnecting and reconnecting to the same network on Linux.
  - Linux helper service may not be restarted after update.
  - Debian package dependencies for Debian Trixie.
  - Possible delay when setting firewall rules on Linux.
  - Update not working in Fedora Silverblue while connected.
  Updated
  - Windows OpenVPN DCO driver to v1.2.1.
  - German translations provided by GitHub user Evonos.
  - Spanish translations provided by GitHub user IceString3.
  - Russian translations in installer.
  - c-ares in wsnet to the latest version 1.33.1, increased timeouts for DNS requests.
  Known Issues:
  - Windows: the Circumvent Censorship feature does nothing when using the TCP protocol due to a missing feature in the OpenVPN DCO driver. If you require use of the the TCP protocol and the Circumvent Censorship feature, you can add ws-use-openvpn-wintun to the Advanced Parameters setting to force the use of the wintun driver.
