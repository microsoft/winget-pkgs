ShortDescription: A media player that's made to emulate some of your favourite media players from the past & bring them into the future.
Description: WACUP (which can be pronounced as wakeup or wac-up or however you prefer it in your native tongue) is my vision of what a media player should be whilst still being compatible with the plug-ins for some of the most popular media players that you are used to. My plan is to include bug fixes, updates of existing features & most importantly new features with the goal to eventually become its own highly compatible media player.
