ReleaseNotes: |-
  This release moves kind to containerd 2.x and contains fixes for nerdctl. It also moves Kubernetes to 1.32.2 by default.
  Breaking Changes
  WARNING: kind v0.27.0+ will be required to use kind load ... subcommands with these new containerd 2.0+ images (built by kind v0.27+). For other use cases, the new images should still work with recent kind releases, but are not guaranteed. As always we strongly recommend consuming images by their sha256 digest for security and reliability. https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/issues/3853
  Older images from recent releases should continue to work with kind v0.27.0+.
  NOTE: As previously warned containerd 2.x requires that you must be using config_path mode for containerd registry config. If you're using the local registry script at, or more recent than https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/commit/791b3dc43cb7cc5cd1d1763fa92c95bab4120903 (kind v0.20.0 / May 22, 2023) then no changes should be necessary.
  The default node image is now kindest/node:v1.32.2@sha256:f226345927d7e348497136874b6d207e0b32cc52154ad8323129352923a3142f
  New Features
  - Updated to containerd 2.x
  - Updated default node image to Kubernetes 1.32.2
  - Updated go to 1.23.6

  NOTE: You must use the @sha256 digest to guarantee an image built for this release, until such a time as we switch to a different tagging scheme. Even then we will highly encourage digest pinning for security and reproducibility reasons.

  NOTE: These node images support amd64 and arm64, both of our supported platforms. You must use the same platform as your host, for more context see https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/issues/2718
  Fixes
  - Compatibility fixes for containerd 2.x
  - Fix kind get clusters with nerdctl
  - Statically link CNI binaries to match upstream
  - Fix no-arguments validation for multiple subcommands
