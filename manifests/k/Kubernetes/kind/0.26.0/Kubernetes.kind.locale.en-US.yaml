ReleaseNotes: |-
  This release brings Kubernetes v1.32.0 to kind by default and fixes kind build node-image for building for Kubernetes releases <v1.31.0 when not building Kubernetes from source (e.g. kind build node-image v1.30.0).
  Breaking Changes
  - Removed two deprecated flags that had been printing usage warnings for many releases.
    - Removed long-deprecated --kube-root flag from kind build node-image, use --type=source and pass the path as an argument instead.
      - Docs: https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#building-images
    - Removed long-deprecated --loglevel flag, use -v / --verbosity instead (see kind help)
  - The default node image is now Kubernetes v1.32.0: kindest/node:v1.32.0@sha256:c48c62eac5da28cdadcf560d1d8616cfa6783b58f0d94cf63ad1bf49600cb027
  New Features
  - Updated to go 1.23.4
  - Updated node image dependencies to latest
    - NOTE: you should only be depending on node images to allow kind to create Kubernetes nodes at a given Kubernetes version. The contents of these images are subject to change. However, we have brought everything up to the latest releases which may contain bug fixes.
  - Updated local-path-provisioner to v0.30.0
  - Refreshed Ingres docs to use https://sigs.k8s.io/cloud-provider-kind
  Images pre-built for this release:

  - v1.30.8: kindest/node:v1.30.8@sha256:17cd608b3971338d9180b00776cb766c50d0a0b6b904ab4ff52fd3fc5c6369bf
  - v1.29.12: kindest/node:v1.29.12@sha256:62c0672ba99a4afd7396512848d6fc382906b8f33349ae68fb1dbfe549f70dec
  NOTE: You must use the @sha256 digest to guarantee an image built for this release, until such a time as we switch to a different tagging scheme. Even then we will highly encourage digest pinning for security and reproducibility reasons.

  NOTE: These node images support amd64 and arm64, both of our supported platforms. You must use the same platform as your host, for more context see https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/issues/2718
  Fixes
  - Fixed kind build node-image --type=url and kind build node-image --type=release where Kubernetes version is less than v1.31.0
    - E.G. kind build node-image v1.30.0 and kind build node-image https://dl.k8s.io/v1.30.0/kubernetes-server-linux-arm64.tar.gz
    - This fix will only work for standard release tags (and not pre-releases etc), for those continue to use --type=source.
    - v1.31.0+ will work with all build types for all versions
