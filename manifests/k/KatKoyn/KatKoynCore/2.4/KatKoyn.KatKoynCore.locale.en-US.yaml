ReleaseNotes: |
  This is the first release with new KatKoyn branding. All functionality is identical to the previous Nyancoin release.
  All previous Nyancoin keys, wallets, blockchain data and everything else is the same.

  Filename Changes
  Due to filename changes, this is NOT a direct drop-in replacement for v2.3
  The previous wallet file, configuration file and blockchain files can be used.
  However some changes will be required:
  - Executables have been renamed, nyancoind -> katkoynd, nyancoin-qt.exe -> katkoyn-qt.exe and other equivalents.
  - The config file has changed from nyancoin.conf to katkoyn.conf
  - The default data directory is now .katkoyn on linux based systems, or similar to ...AppData\Roaming\KatKoyn on Windows and others.
  
  Suggested upgrade process
  - Download the new version, or compile from source if required.
  - Stop the old version and wait for it to exit completely.
  - Make at least one backup of wallet.dat, preferably multiple copies to an external storage device (You should be doing this regularly anyway)
  - Remove the old executable, and replace with the new. Old ones are named nyancoin*, new are katkoyn*
  - Rename the configuration file from nyancoin.conf to katkoyn.conf
  - Rename the folder / directory that contains the data files. Anything previously named 'nyancoin' is now 'katkoyn'
  - Alternatively if using command line options to set a custom data directory, this can be kept as-is, or you can rename the location and amend the command line to match.
  - Start the executable. If you have previously used command line options, these will still be valid.
  If these filename and location changes are not made, the software will run as for a new installation, and all previously used files will be ignored including the wallet. If this happens, you have NOT lost anything - it's just that the wallet and other files are not recognised. Stopping, renaming and starting again will fix that problem.

  New installations
  - Download the new version, or compile from source if required.
  - For GUI desktop versions, copy the executable to a suitable location.
  - For katkoynd command line versions, it is recommended to run the executable under it's own user, with the files in a directory for that user.
  - Start the executable, the default data location will be used.
  - Alternatively a custom location can be set using command line options.
  - Wait while the blockchain is downloaded - this will take several hours or more depending on system capabilities.
  - When complete, make at least one backup of wallet.dat, and continue to make backups regularly.
  WARNING: If wallet.dat is deleted or corrupted, all of your KatKoyn will be lost forever. Backups are essential.

  Installation Notes
  Approximately 4GB of disk space is required for the blockchain files. This will increase over time.
  Using spinning rust disks as storage may impact startup time, however should not affect operation once the blockchain is fully synced.
  If using a Raspberry Pi or similar, an external storage device is recommended. Storing blockchain files on an SD card will result in very poor performance and is likely to cause premature failure of the card.

  For virtual servers, cloud environments and devices such as the Raspberry Pi, a minimum of 2GB RAM is suggested. It may be possible to run it with less, but performance is likely to be poor.

  The software uses port 33701 for incoming peer to peer connections.
  For the best performance, this port should be opened in your firewall.
  For desktop versions this can be done via uPNP: Settings - Options - Network and select the 'map port using uPNP' option.
  For command line, you will need to configure any software firewall, upstream firewall or gateway manually to allow incoming connections on 33701.
  The software will still function with port 33701 blocked, however you will only have outgoing connections which will probably result in a very small number of connected peers.
