  Portable and installable builds for UWP, PWA, Electron and NWJS
  Kiwix is an offline browser of archival content from Wikipedia, Project Gutenberg, TED Talks, Wikivoyage, Stackexchange, and many other sources. It makes knowledge available to people with limited or no Internet access. The software as well as the content is free for anyone to use. It requires at least one offline ZIM archive (which can be downloaded in the app).

  To use this app, download your choice of free content in-app from the Download Library on the Configuration page. For what's new, see the changes listed in the CHANGELOG. Builds are provided for 32bit and 64bit editions of Windows and Linux (tested on Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora and OpenSUSE).
  MS Store status: PUBLISHED
  Winget status: PUBLISHED
  Please choose the correct version (those marked [AUTO] will self-update automatically when there is a new version):
  - Any modern OS (PWA)
    - Try out our installable PWA (Progressive Web App) simply by visiting https://pwa.kiwix.org/ [AUTO]. Incredibly light, no store or download required, no heavy framework! It works offline once the app has cached its code, and in Chrome/Edge/Chromium, you can install it right from within the app (in Firefox you can bookmark it). On Android (Chrome), we strongly recommend you enable the Private File System option (when you click Select Storage), as it is much faster, and you can download archives directly into this storage. (This option exists in Firefox for Android, but it is currently limited to just 10GB.) On iOS (Safari), you can add the PWA to your home screen - NB on iOS only you must use Safari because Apple currently bans Service Workers in other browsers.
  - Linux (see installation instructions below screenshot):
    - Portable (Electron) - recommended
      - AppImage 64bit (Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, OpenSUSE): Kiwix-JS-Electron-3.6.6-E.AppImage [AUTO]
      - AppImage ARM64 for Linux on ARM only (Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, opnSUSE): Kiwix-JS-Electron-3.6.6-E-arm64.AppImage [AUTO]
      - AppImage 32bit (Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, OpenSUSE): Kiwix-JS-Electron-3.6.6-E-i386.AppImage [AUTO]

      - Deb package 64bit (Ubuntu, Debian): kiwix-js-electron_3.6.6-E_amd64.deb
      - Deb package 32bit (Ubuntu, Debian): kiwix-js-electron_3.6.6-E_i386.deb
      - RPM package 64bit (Fedora, OpenSUSE): kiwix-js-electron-3.6.6-E.x86_64.rpm

      - Alternatively, run winget install kiwix.kiwixjs.electron in a Windows 10/11 Terminal [AUTO]
    - Portable - no install needed
      - WARNING: Windows XP or Vista only (legacy version): kiwix_js_windows-XP-3.6.6-N-win-ia32.zip - do not use this with modern Windows!
      - Windows 10/11 32bit (also runs on 64bit): self-contained portable version, no unzip needed - Kiwix-JS-Electron-3.6.6-E.exe (if you find this version slow to launch, try the Setup version above, or a zipped version below)
      - [Electron] Windows 10/11 64bit: just unzip to any drive or folder - Kiwix-JS-Electron-3.6.6-E.zip (for 32bit or Win7+, plese use the Win7 installer above)

  Installation Instructions - Electron/NWJS
  - For the Windows Web installer for Windows 10/11, simply download and launch. It will select the correct architecture automatically and install itself, together with a shortcut in your shortcut menu. It auto-updates, but if you want to update it manually, then just install a new version over it (it will uninstall the old one for you). Please note that the Web installer needs Web access during the installation. If this is a problem, then use the standalone installer.
  - For the Windows 10/11 Portable builds (64bit only), the executable version (ending .exe) can just be run, but it may be a bit slow to start up. For a faster experience, use one of the zipped versions: unzip the contents of the package to any folder, or to a thumb drive, and double click on Start Kiwix JS [Electron/Windows] or Start Kiwix JS [Electron/Windows].bat.
  - For Windows 7/8/8.1, due to the deprecation of Chromium on these platforms, we now only provide one option: a standalone installer built with the last version of Electron that supported Chrome on Windows 7+. This is also a 32bit package (but will run on 64bit).
  - Microsoft Defender SmartScreen warning: If you get a Smartscreen notification when downloading an .exe, or on first launch of the zipped portable apps, follow instructions to "Run anyway" if you trust this site. Additionally, when you first download an .exe installer, you may get a warning in your downloads "Kiwix-JS-Electron isn't commonly downloaded". If you see this, click on the file and choose "Keep anyway". A second screen may then popup telling you the publisher. So long as it's Kiwix, then click on "Sow more" and allow the app. If you prefer, use one of the appx versions (ending .appx or .appxbundle) as this format runs in a secure, isolated container.
  - For the Linux portable builds, download and save the correct AppImage file anywhere (e.g. your Desktop), and double-click it. If it doesn’t work, open a terminal and run chmod a+x Kiwix-JS-Electron*.AppImage and then ./Kiwix-JS-Electron*.AppImage. This version will auto-update.
    - On Debian, if you have issues running the AppImage on older versions of the OS, you can try adding the --no-sandbox switch to the command (see electron/electron#17972 (comment)). This is not necessary on recent versions.
    - On OpenSUSE, you may need to install Chrome in order to get the dependencies necessary to run the AppImage (because Electron apps run Chrome internally). With older versions of OpenSUSE, you may additionally need to use these commandline switches: ./Kiwix-JS-Electron*.AppImage --use-gl=disabled --disable-gpu-compositing,¹ but this is no longer necessary in recent versions.
    - On ChromeOS, you need to run the AppImage in the Debian-based VM (Crostini). Download the appropriate AppImage for your Chromebook (the standard AppImage if it uses an Intel Celeron, or the ARM64 version if it has an ARM chip). Move this file to you Linux Files. Do chmod +x on the file. Then run with ./Kiwix-JS-Electron-x.x.x-E.AppImage. If you get errors about missing fuse and libnss3, simply install these manually: sudo apt-get install fuse and sudo apt-get install libnss3.
  - For the Linux installable builds:
    - Debian/Ubuntu: download the correct .deb package. Open a terminal, cd to the directory containing the package, and type sudo apt-get update followed by chmod a+x ./kiwix-js-electron*.deb, then sudo apt install ./kiwix-js-electron*.deb. To run the app from the command line, rather than from its installed icon, simply type kiwix-js-electron in terminal. On Debian, if you receive the error libgbm.so.1: cannot open shared object file, please run sudo apt install libgbm-dev. On older versions of Debian, you may have to add --no-sandbox to the command line when running the app, i.e. kiwix-js-electron --no-sandbox. When you want to update, just install the new version, and it will install over the old version.
    - Fedora: download the correct .rpm package. You should be able to install it by opening the File manager, locating the package, and double-clicking it. Alternatively, open a terminal and cd to the directory with the package, and then type sudo rpm --install ./kiwix-js-electron-*.rpm (you may need to do chmod a+x kiwix-js-electron-*.rpm first). After install, you should find Kiwix JS Electron in your app list, and you can launch it from there. To upgrade, locate the newly downloaded package in terminal and type sudo rpm --upgrade ./kiwix.js.electron-*.rpm (ensure you specify the correct package number in place of * if you have more than one). If you find the app is stuck looking for an old sample package after upgrade, please just press the Reset button next to the version number at the top of Configuration.
    - OpenSUSE: download the correct .rpm package. You may get a better installation experience if you first install Chrome or another Chromium browser, as the Electron app has the same dependencies as Chrome. Then open a Terminal with superuser privileges, navigate to the directory containing the .rpm package, and type zypper install kiwix-js-electron-*.rpm (you may need to do chmod a+x kiwix-js-electron-*.rpm first). If you are informed about missing dependencies, try "Solution 2: break kiwix-js-electron... by ignoring some of its dependencies'. You will also be warned that the app is not signed. You can ignore this, if you trust this repository. See above for commandline switches in older versions of OpenSUSE.
  ¹ With many thanks to Jay Midura for documenting the switches needed for OpenSUSE.
