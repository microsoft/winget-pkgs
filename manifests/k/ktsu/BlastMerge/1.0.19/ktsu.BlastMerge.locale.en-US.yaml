ShortDescription: Cross-repository file synchronization through intelligent iterative merging
Description: |-
  BlastMerge is a revolutionary file synchronization tool that uses intelligent iterative merging to unify multiple versions of files across repositories, directories, and codebases.
  Unlike traditional diff tools, BlastMerge progressively merges file versions by finding the most similar pairs and resolving conflicts interactively, ultimately synchronizing entire file ecosystems into a single, unified version.

  Key Features:
  - Smart Discovery: Automatically finds all versions of a file across directories/repositories
  - Hash-Based Grouping: Groups identical files and identifies unique versions
  - Similarity Analysis: Calculates similarity scores between all version pairs
  - Optimal Merge Order: Progressively merges the most similar versions first to minimize conflicts
  - Interactive Resolution: Visual TUI for resolving conflicts block-by-block
  - Cross-Repository Sync: Updates all file locations with the final merged result
