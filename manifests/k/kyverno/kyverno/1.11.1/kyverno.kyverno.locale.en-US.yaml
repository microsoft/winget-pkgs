ShortDescription: Kyverno is a policy engine designed for Kubernetes.
Description: |-
  Kyverno is a policy engine designed for Kubernetes.
  It can validate, mutate, and generate configurations using admission controls and background scans.
  Kyverno policies are Kubernetes resources and do not require learning a new language.
  Kyverno is designed to work nicely with tools you already use like kubectl, kustomize, and Git.
