  Added
  - Added code name filtering to the "Search in code" window by @VladiStep in #2152.
    - (The script which was previously capable of this, SearchLimited.csx, has now been removed.)
  - Added functionality for using currently-selected code editor text as the default search text in the "Search in code" window by @VladiStep in #2154.
  - Underanalyzer: CSX scripts can now take advantage of the newly-added EnumerateChildren() on AST nodes that are produced by the decompiler, which can be useful for programmatically analyzing code, recursively.
  Changed
  - Game-specific data updated for base GameMaker functions and Deltarune functions updated, through multiple contributions by @colinator27, @Jacky720, and @VladiStep.
  - New all-in-one Undertale/Deltarune debug script added, Debug.csx, with new support for the recently-released Deltarune chapters.
    - (Special thanks to folks from the community for figuring out crash fixes.)
  - All of the UTDR (Undertale/Deltarune) scripts have been renamed/recategorized to make it obvious which ones apply to which game.
  - Code for sequence asset handling has been cleaned up, now properly supports color tracks, and has added support for audio effect tracks by @colinator27 in #2123.
  - Added os_switch2 constant to the GML compiler and decompiler.
  - GML decompiler settings: "Allow leftover data on VM stack" is now enabled by default, which turns its exception into a warning.
    - (This makes a decompiler error in some games no longer occur.)
  - Small room asset instance ID deserialization performance boost and cleanup by @BioTomateDE in #2195.
  - Strip metadata before writing auto-generated images by @Dobby233Liu in #2206.
  Fixed
  - Fixed ExportSpritesAsGIF.csx for sprites with no frames by @babro1 in #2139.
  - Fixed the GML VM disassembler producing Windows newlines, which was inconsistent with the GML decompiler (it will now always use Unix newlines) by @VladiStep in #2153.
  - Fixed tileset grid size in the room editor not properly depending on the tileset asset size (leading to incorrect results in some cases) by @CST1229 in #2155.
  - Fixed ExportAllSounds.csx not properly creating directories in some cases of exporting external sounds.
  - Fixed a crash that could occur when right-clicking some blank spots in the Game Object event grid by @VladiStep in #2177.
  - Fixed the "Update range" button layout in font editor by @VladiStep in #2181.
  - Fixed the loop condition for the CLI's PromptLoadFile scripting method, similarly to how PromptChooseDirectory was fixed in a previous release, by @ancientstraits in #2199.
  - Fixed ImportGML.csx not properly filtering for only GML files, and not properly supporting no-link imports.
  - Underanalyzer: Fixed compilation and decompilation of local function references from within a function declaration's argument list (default values), or within its inheritance call arguments.
