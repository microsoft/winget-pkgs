ShortDescription: 'The most complete tool for modding, decompiling and unpacking Undertale (and other Game Maker: Studio games!)'
Description: |-
  The most complete tool for modding, decompiling and unpacking Undertale (and other GameMaker games!)

  Main Features:
  - Can read every single byte from the data file for latest versions of Undertale, Deltarune, and most other GameMaker games, and then recreate a byte-for-byte exact copy from the decoded data.
  - Properly handles all of the pointers in the file so that if you add/remove stuff, make things longer/shorter, move them around, etc., the file format won't break.
  - An editor which lets you change (almost) every single value, including unknown ones.
  - Includes a simple room/level editor.
  - Allows for GML VM code editing. This means you can add any custom code to a game, either using the built-in GML compiler or GML assembly. (YYC is not supported for this.)
  - High-level GML decompiler and compiler. Supports a large range of GameMaker versions, and most important GML features (still missing a few).
  - Support for running scripts that automatically modify your data file (or perform other nefarious tasks). This can be used for mod distribution, aside from other methods such as file patches/project systems.
  - All core functionality extracted into a library for use in external tools.
  - Can generate a .yydebug file for the GM:S debugger so that you can edit variables live! (see here)
  - Automatic file associations for all GameMaker related data files. This is opt-in at the first boot of the tool, and can also be disabled by having a dna.txt file next to the executable.

  Added
  - Added code name filtering to the "Search in code" window by @VladiStep in #2152.
    - (The script which was previously capable of this, SearchLimited.csx, has now been removed.)
  - Added functionality for using currently-selected code editor text as the default search text in the "Search in code" window by @VladiStep in #2154.
  - Underanalyzer: CSX scripts can now take advantage of the newly-added EnumerateChildren() on AST nodes that are produced by the decompiler, which can be useful for programmatically analyzing code, recursively.

  Changed
  - Game-specific data updated for base GameMaker functions and Deltarune functions updated, through multiple contributions by @colinator27, @Jacky720, and @VladiStep.
  - New all-in-one Undertale/Deltarune debug script added, Debug.csx, with new support for the recently-released Deltarune chapters.
    - (Special thanks to folks from the community for figuring out crash fixes.)
  - All of the UTDR (Undertale/Deltarune) scripts have been renamed/recategorized to make it obvious which ones apply to which game.
  - Code for sequence asset handling has been cleaned up, now properly supports color tracks, and has added support for audio effect tracks by @colinator27 in #2123.
  - Added os_switch2 constant to the GML compiler and decompiler.
  - GML decompiler settings: "Allow leftover data on VM stack" is now enabled by default, which turns its exception into a warning.
    - (This makes a decompiler error in some games no longer occur.)
  - Small room asset instance ID deserialization performance boost and cleanup by @BioTomateDE in #2195.
  - Strip metadata before writing auto-generated images by @Dobby233Liu in #2206.

  Fixed
  - Fixed ExportSpritesAsGIF.csx for sprites with no frames by @babro1 in #2139.
  - Fixed the GML VM disassembler producing Windows newlines, which was inconsistent with the GML decompiler (it will now always use Unix newlines) by @VladiStep in #2153.
  - Fixed tileset grid size in the room editor not properly depending on the tileset asset size (leading to incorrect results in some cases) by @CST1229 in #2155.
  - Fixed ExportAllSounds.csx not properly creating directories in some cases of exporting external sounds.
  - Fixed a crash that could occur when right-clicking some blank spots in the Game Object event grid by @VladiStep in #2177.
  - Fixed the "Update range" button layout in font editor by @VladiStep in #2181.
  - Fixed the loop condition for the CLI's PromptLoadFile scripting method, similarly to how PromptChooseDirectory was fixed in a previous release, by @ancientstraits in #2199.
  - Fixed ImportGML.csx not properly filtering for only GML files, and not properly supporting no-link imports.
  - Underanalyzer: Fixed compilation and decompilation of local function references from within a function declaration's argument list (default values), or within its inheritance call arguments.
