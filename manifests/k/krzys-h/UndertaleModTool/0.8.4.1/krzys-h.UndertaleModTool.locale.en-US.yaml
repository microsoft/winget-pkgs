ShortDescription: 'The most complete tool for modding, decompiling and unpacking Undertale (and other Game Maker: Studio games!)'
Description: |-
  The most complete tool for modding, decompiling and unpacking Undertale (and other GameMaker games!)

  Main Features:
  - Can read every single byte from the data file for latest versions of Undertale, Deltarune, and most other GameMaker games, and then recreate a byte-for-byte exact copy from the decoded data.
  - Properly handles all of the pointers in the file so that if you add/remove stuff, make things longer/shorter, move them around, etc., the file format won't break.
  - An editor which lets you change (almost) every single value, including unknown ones.
  - Includes a simple room/level editor.
  - Allows for GML VM code editing. This means you can add any custom code to a game, either using the built-in GML compiler or GML assembly. (YYC is not supported for this.)
  - High-level GML decompiler and compiler. Supports a large range of GameMaker versions, and most important GML features (still missing a few).
  - Support for running scripts that automatically modify your data file (or perform other nefarious tasks). This can be used for mod distribution, aside from other methods such as file patches/project systems.
  - All core functionality extracted into a library for use in external tools.
  - Can generate a .yydebug file for the GM:S debugger so that you can edit variables live! (see here)
  - Automatic file associations for all GameMaker related data files. This is opt-in at the first boot of the tool, and can also be disabled by having a dna.txt file next to the executable.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  This is the 0.8.4.1 UndertaleModTool release, for 64-bit Windows. Downloads can be found at the bottom of this release.

  Changelog
  Note: This is a patch release. To see the changes in major release 0.8.0.0, click here. To see the changes in minor release 0.8.4.0, click here.
  Added
  - Implemented a failsafe so that DDS textures are still able to be loaded when they use unsupported features.
  - Implemented support for loading/saving unknown (or otherwise unsupported and/or proprietary) texture formats. These won't convert to other formats, nor display properly, but their data will be retained.
  Fixed
  - Fixed the import button for newly-created textures causing a crash by @ELBROWN777 in #2303
  - Fixed support for DDS textures with mipmaps by @luizzeroxis in #2305
  - Updated compilation instructions to mention that the .NET 10 SDK is now required for building, as well as recursively cloning using Git.
  Other Technical Changes
  - Optimized variable lookups in the UndertaleModLib side of the GML compiler. (Apparently, this was a bigger performance issue than previously thought, saving several seconds of time in a reported case.)
  - Texture parsing is now aware of the texture block length field that appears in newer GameMaker versions.
