ReleaseNotes: |-
  This is the 0.8.2.0 UndertaleModTool release, for 64-bit Windows. Downloads can be found at the bottom of this release.
  ("UTMT_CLI" is the command-line interface version with no GUI, supported for Windows, Ubuntu, and macOS.)

  Changed
  - Updated 17 scripts to no longer be Windows-only (and thus now usable from the CLI) by @Eliandro4 in #2125.
  - In addition to the above scripts, ExportFontData.csx has been functionally changed to ExportAllFonts.csx, and is now cross-platform.
  - All scripts have been slightly renamed and recategorized, hopefully in a more intuitive manner. A few ancient and obsolete scripts have been removed outright.
  - A myriad of small changes/improvements have been made to a number of scripts for consistency. Most notably, all of the exporter scripts now allow choosing the output directory, rather than forcing an arbitrary one. Some corresponding importer scripts have been updated to reflect this.
  - The CLI (command-line interface) version of the tool now comes bundled with all of the built-in scripts that the main tool does.
    - (Note: Not every script is supported with the CLI. Check SCRIPTS.md for details on this.)
  - The documentation contained within SCRIPTS.md is no longer years out of date. It now accurately contains basic information on what every built-in script does.
  Fixed
  - Fixed some built-in script compilation errors.
  - Fixed errors sometimes caused when copying certain text by @luizzeroxis in #2129.
  - Fixed function resolution for newly-defined global functions during a batch GML code import.
    - (On a technical note, this means that the compiler now parses all global scripts in a batch before any bytecode gets generated.)
  - Fixed the PromptLoadFile implementation in the CLI, so that it no longer loops incorrectly.
    - (A small change was made to the behavior for this method and PromptChooseDirectory. Now, it's possible to specify nothing, which is consistent with the ability to cancel in the GUI.)
  - Fixed some built-in GML constants that were missing from the compiler, but were present in the decompiler.
  - Fixed buggy behavior when using CodeImportGroup after it threw an exception during an import; it will now always clear its queue.
  - Fixed missing constant resolution for scr_debug_keycheck's argument in the game-specific data for Deltarune.
  - Fixed some behavior in ImportSingleSound.csx (previously ImportASound.csx), ImportSounds.csx (previously ImportSoundsBulk.csx), and ImportMasks.csx.
