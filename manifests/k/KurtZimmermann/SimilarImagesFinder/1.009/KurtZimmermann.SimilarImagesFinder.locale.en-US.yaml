ShortDescription: Program for finding and removing identical and similar images from your computer.
Description: Quick search for similar images. SimilarImagesFinder can operate in two modes - find absolutely identical pictures and find similar images. In the first case, the duplicate picture remover searches for completely identical images. In the second case, the application similar image finder searches for images which are different, but are basically the same images. For example, it may be two images from the same image but of different size or dimensions or different shades of color, and so on.
