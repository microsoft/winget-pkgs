ShortDescription: Cross-platform backup tool for Windows, macOS & Linux with fast, incremental backups, client-side end-to-end encryption, compression and data deduplication. CLI and GUI included.
Description: |-
  Kopia is a fast and secure open-source backup/restore tool that allows you to create encrypted snapshots of your data and save the snapshots to remote or cloud storage of your choice, to network-attached storage or server, or locally on your machine.
  Kopia does not 'image' your whole machine.
  Rather, Kopia allows you to backup/restore any and all files/directories that you deem are important or critical.
