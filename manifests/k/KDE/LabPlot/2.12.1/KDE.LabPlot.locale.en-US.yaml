  In the area of small UX-improvements, we added the Shift+Enter shortcut in the Properties Explorer for all analysis curves (fitting, smooth, etc.) which allows to quickly re-calculate the results using the same shortcut as in the notebook. Furthermore, we improved the tab-order and layouts in multiple properties widgets.
  In parallel, we are also working on the new features and improvements that will arrive in the next major release which will come with multiple big and highly awaited features. We’ll introduce these features in upcoming blog posts. Stay tuned!
