Description: |-
  An application to visualise the disk usage on your computer by showing folders using an easy-to-understand view of concentric rings, which makes it simple to free up space.

  Note that due to complexities with AppX files, the Winget package's listed version numbers do not line up with those of the otherwise near-identical .exe-based "KDE.Filelight" package.
