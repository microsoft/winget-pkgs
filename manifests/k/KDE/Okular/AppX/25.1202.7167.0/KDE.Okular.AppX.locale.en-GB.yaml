Description: |-
  Fast and packed with features, Okular allows you to read PDF documents, comics and EPub books, browse images, visualise Markdown documents, and much more.

  Note that due to complexities with AppX files, the Winget package's listed version numbers do not line up with those of the otherwise near-identical .exe-based "KDE.Okular" package.
