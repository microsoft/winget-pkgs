ShortDescription: The most feature-rich free astronomy software
Description: |-
  KStars is freely licensed, open source, cross-platform Astronomy Software by KDE.
  It provides an accurate graphical simulation of the night sky, from any location on Earth, at any date and time. The display includes up to 100 million stars, 13,000 deep-sky objects,all 8 planets, the Sun and Moon, and thousands of comets, asteroids, supernovae, and satellites.
  For students and teachers, it supports adjustable simulation speeds in order to view phenomena that happen over long timescales, the KStars Astrocalculator to predict conjunctions, and many common astronomical calculations.
  For the amateur astronomer, it provides an observation planner, a sky calendar tool, and an FOV editor to calculate field of view of equipment and display them. Find out interesting objects in the "What's up Tonight" tool, plot altitude vs. time graphs for any object, print high-quality sky charts, and gain access to lots of information and resources to help you explore the universe!
  Included with KStars is Ekos astrophotography suite, a complete astrophotography solution that can control all INDI devices including numerous telescopes, CCDs, DSLRs, focusers, filters, and a lot more. Ekos supports highly accurate tracking using online and offline astrometry solver, autofocus and autoguiding capabilities, and capture of single or multiple images using the powerful built in sequence manager.
  Astronomical Catalogs:
  - Default catalog consisting of stars to magnitude 8
  - Extra catalogs consisting of 100 million stars to magnitude 16
  - Downloadable catalogs including Messier Images, Abell Planetary Nebulae, Sharpless Catalog, Lynds Dark Nebula Catalog
  - Corrections for precession, nutation and atmospheric refraction
  - Tools for retrieval of data from online databases

ReleaseNotes: |-
  KStars v3.7.5 is released on 2025.02.03 for Windows, MacOS & Linux. It's a bi-monthly bug-fix release with a couple of exciting features. Here are the release notes organized by developer.
  Jasem Mutlaq
  - Added dome slit visualization on sky map. Specify the Dome Measurement parameters in the INDI Dome driver to see a live dome slit overlay in the Sky Map.
  - Implemented generic DBus methods for KStars options
  - Added SchedulerSleeping event
  - Added mutex protection for multi-threaded resources
  - Enhanced scheduler loading and settings management
  - Improved filter manager operations
  - Fixed video subframing. Up to 50x improvement in subframed video feeds.
  - Fixed multiple profile editor issues
  - Added VSCode development setup support
  Hy Murveit
  - Fixed DMS delta angle calculation
  - Added mandatory settle to PAA
  - Improved imaging planner stability
  - Fixed pierside placeholder directory usage
  - Added START_AT scheduler test
  - Fixed Abell planetary nebula lookup
  - Enhanced PAA adjustment estimation
  Wolfgang Reissenberger
  - Implemented video sequence capture. Preliminary support for capturing Video files as regular sequences in the Capture module. Great news for EAA.
  - Fixed focus options
  - Improved remote directory handling
  - Fixed flats with wall position
  - Enhanced filter wheel integration
  John Evans
  - Enabled focuser controls when camera disconnected
  - Improved focus measure framing
  - Fixed focus advisor code warnings
  - Updated aberration inspector functionality
  Toni Schriber
  - Fixed overshooting cosine in CachingDms calculation
  - Implemented calibration reuse after rotation. Guide calibration data can now be re-used between sessions after rotation.
  Ben Cooksley
  - Removed CMake trace/debug logs from CI runs
  György Balló
  - Set window icon
  Oliver Kellogg
  - Fixed typo in FITS Viewer configuration
  Akarsh Simha
  - Fixed right-click popup menu on deep stars
  Technical Highlights
  - Improved capture sequence stability: Set 5-minute timeout for transient operations (dome motion, mount parking/unparking, dust cap operations, focusing, filter wheel changes) to prevent indefinite sequence stalling.
  - Improved mount rotation processing
  - Enhanced scheduler loading mechanism
  - Added mutex protection for multi-threaded resources
  - Improved capture operation timeout handling
