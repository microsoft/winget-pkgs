ShortDescription: The most feature-rich free astronomy software
Description: |-
  KStars is freely licensed, open source, cross-platform Astronomy Software by KDE.
  It provides an accurate graphical simulation of the night sky, from any location on Earth, at any date and time. The display includes up to 100 million stars, 13,000 deep-sky objects,all 8 planets, the Sun and Moon, and thousands of comets, asteroids, supernovae, and satellites.
  For students and teachers, it supports adjustable simulation speeds in order to view phenomena that happen over long timescales, the KStars Astrocalculator to predict conjunctions, and many common astronomical calculations.
  For the amateur astronomer, it provides an observation planner, a sky calendar tool, and an FOV editor to calculate field of view of equipment and display them. Find out interesting objects in the "What's up Tonight" tool, plot altitude vs. time graphs for any object, print high-quality sky charts, and gain access to lots of information and resources to help you explore the universe!
  Included with KStars is Ekos astrophotography suite, a complete astrophotography solution that can control all INDI devices including numerous telescopes, CCDs, DSLRs, focusers, filters, and a lot more. Ekos supports highly accurate tracking using online and offline astrometry solver, autofocus and autoguiding capabilities, and capture of single or multiple images using the powerful built in sequence manager.
  Astronomical Catalogs:

ReleaseNotes: |-
  KStars v3.8.1 is released on 2026.02.092 for Windows, Linux, and MacOS.

  For Linux users, it's highly recommended to use the official KStars Flatpak hosted at Flathub. You can install the stable flatpak or try out new features by downloading the KStars Nightly Flatpak for x86_64 and arm64 architectures.
  This is mostly a bugfix release with nice improvements in debayering algorithms thanks to John Evan's work on this using OpenCV. Here are some highlights:

   Scheduler & Observatory Automation
  - Enhanced weather-based scheduling with proper abort/resume during soft shutdown
  - Improved preemptive shutdown with wakeup timers and better state management
  - Safety monitor now continues monitoring even after complete shutdown
  - Fixed jobs incorrectly marked as aborted when completed
  Live Stacking Improvements
  - Added debayering support for multiple cameras including Touptek
  - Implemented hot/cold pixel removal
  - Added XISF file format support with debayering
  - General bayer processing refactoring

  Meridian Flip & Alignment
  - Fixed capture operation timeouts during meridian flips
  - Added extensive logging for post-flip actions
  - Improved rotator timeout handling - now aborts alignment instead of waiting indefinitely
  Reliability & Error Handling
  - More resilient INDI web manager connectivity checks with graceful failures
  - Fixed ADU-based flat frame signature matching
  - Improved filter offset handling for multi-camera setups
  - Better dark frame diagnostic logging
  Other Fixes
  - Fixed comet position calculations for hyperbolic orbits (e.g., 3I/ATLAS)
  - Improved artificial horizon importer to handle spaces in files
  - Enhanced HIPS survey filtering and sorting with partial sky survey support. Support for many more catalogs like NSNS
