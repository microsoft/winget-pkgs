ShortDescription: Write down your thoughts
Description: Marknote lets you create rich text notes and easily organise them into notebooks. You can personalise your notebooks by choosing an icon and accent color for each one, making it easy to distinguish between them and keep your notes at your fingertips. Your notes are saved as Markdown files in your Documents folder, making it easy to use your notes outside of Marknote as well as inside the app.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  On small phone screens, you want as much space as possible to write and read your notes. MarkNote now lets you hide the editor toolbar on mobile, so you can focus on the important stuff while having the formatting options just a tap away.
  On desktop, you can now adjust the width of the note list and editor by dragging the separator, just like in other desktop applications.
  You can now undo and redo changes using buttons in the UI, rather than relying on keyboard shortcuts, which is especially helpful if you're using a virtual keyboard that may not have a control key. The application menu has been reorganized and simplified to make it less cluttered.
  We added implemented clickable links! You can now ctrl-click links to open them.
  To make it easier to switch from your current notes application to MarkNote, MarkNote now offers several import options. for now you can import your notes from KNotes and maildir.
