  - Data import (e.g. SPSS, Stata and CSV)

ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Fixed: Crash when trying to edit a data.frame containing columns that are not vectors
  - Fixed: Basic statistics would refuse to "overwrite file", even if saving to file was unchecked
  - Changed: Status indicator for preview windows (updating/ready) is less obstrusive
  - Added: Ability to open PDF documents inside the RKWard window, and associated R function rk.show.pdf()
  - Fixed: Add breeze icons as a fallback on systems that use a different icon theme (fixes missing icons)
  - Added: Setup dialog includes setting to select a different R installation
  - Added: Command line option "--setup" to force (re-)initialization as if a new version of RKWard had been installed
  - Fixed: R functions loadhistory(), savehistory(), and timestamp() broken
  - Changed: R shared library is now loaded, dynamically, rather than linked at compile time.
             This allows more flexibility on which R version to use at runtime, esp. in the context of AppImage binaries
  - Fixed: References to the package cairoDevice (removed on CRAN) have been replaced with Cairo
  - Fixed: Creating new output window from the UI would sometimes show empty window
  - Fixed: Better support for running from non-standard paths on Linux (e.g. user-local installation in home dir)
  - Fixed: Added REUSE license information where missing
  - Fixed: Handling of carriage returns in R Console window (used in progress bars, importantly)
  - Fixed: Crash when renaming top level object from context menu
  - Changed: First version to be based on Qt6/KF6
