Description: |-
  Kapman is a clone of the well known game Pac-Man.
  You must run through the maze to eat all pills without being captured by a ghost. By eating an energizer, Kapman gets the ability to eat ghosts for a few seconds. When a stage is cleared of pills and energizer the player is taken to the next stage with slightly increased game speed.
