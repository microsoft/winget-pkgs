ShortDescription: Free and Open Source Video Editor
Description: |-
  Kdenlive is an acronym for KDE Non-Linear Video Editor.
  It is a free software (GPL licensed) primarily aimed at the Linux platform, but it also works on BSD1 as it relies only on portable components (Qt and MLT framework). Windows versions are also available, with some drawbacks. See Windows Issues for more information. A port on MacOS is also available.
  Through the MLT framework Kdenlive integrates many effects for video and audio processing or creation. Furthermore, Kdenlive brings a powerful titling tool, a subtitling feature with AI-supported speech to text conversion, nested timelines (new in version 23.04), animation support through Glaxnimate integration (new in version 22.08) and thus can be used as a complete studio for video creation. Check out What’s New for the most recent feature additions.
