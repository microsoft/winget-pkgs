ShortDescription: Matrix Client
Description: |-
  NeoChat is a chat app that lets you take full advantage of the Matrix network. It provides you with a secure way to send text messages, videos and audio files to your family, colleagues and friends.
  NeoChat aims to be a fully featured application for the Matrix specification. As such everything in the current stable specification with the notable exceptions of VoIP, threads and some aspects of End-to-End Encryption are supported. There are a few other smaller omissions due to the fact that the Matrix spec is constantly evolving but the aim remains to provide eventual support for the entire spec.
  Due to the nature of the Matrix specification development NeoChat also supports numerous unstable features. Currently these are:
  - Polls - MSC3381
  - Sticker Packs - MSC2545
  - Location Events - MSC3488
