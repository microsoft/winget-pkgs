  A chat app that lets you take full advantage of the Matrix network. It provides you with a secure way to send text messages, videos and audio files to your family, colleagues and friends.

  Note that due to complexities with AppX files, the Winget package's listed version numbers do not line up with those of the otherwise near-identical .exe-based «KDE.NeoChat» package.
