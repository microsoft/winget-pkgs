ReleaseNotes: |-
  Today we are releasing Krita 5.2.13! This is a bugfix release containing a number of important Android fixes, courtesy of Carsten Hartenfels, our new Android Maintainer. The release also includes a security fix that affected the work with TGA files.
  16K Page Size support
  Some devices running Android 15 have so much working memory that Android 15 increased the page size (the smallest unit the working memory is divided up in). To work with on these devices, programs like Krita need some adjustments, or else they won't even run! With Krita 5.2.13 you won't have to worry about this distinction anymore, as 16K page size support has been added.
  Saving fixes
  One of the most frequent crashes on Android was caused by background saving going wrong. We've overhauled the saving service, fixing crashes when Krita was being shut down or when it is inactive in the background.
  Now, operating systems like Android make file system handling a little tricky because they would like to keep each file inside a so-called sandbox, so your program cannot do anything without your explicit permission. This is generally a good thing, but it is very different from how desktop operating systems work, and we're still working on figuring out how to make Krita work more pleasantly while staying inside the sandbox, so look out for that in the future!
  Transform fixes
  Previously, the transform tool would not work with touch, because it relied on mouse-press, instead of mouse-click, which is what touch events are. We've worked around this, and now you should be able to manipulate the transform widget with your fingers.
  Automatically disable touch-painting on devices with stylus present
  Now, when Krita detects a stylus present in proximity of the tablet device it automatically disables touch painting for the rest of the session. It lets new users start painting with their stylus right away without visiting Krita's Preferences dialog. If you still want to be able to paint with your fingers and with your stylus at the same time, you can explicitly enable touch-painting in Configure Krita->General->Tools->Touch Painting->Enabled.
  Fix for a security issue when loading TGA files
  There was a theoretical security issue when loading TGA files, which could cause buffer overflow in Krita. This issue is now fixed in Krita 5.2.13. If you have not yet updated to 5.2.13 we highly recommend you to avoid opening TGA files from unknown sources.
  Other
  Beyond that, there are two crash fixes.
  - Index Colors: fix crash when filtering non-transparent layer
  - Fix crash in palette docker with add swatch dialog. (Bug 507601)
