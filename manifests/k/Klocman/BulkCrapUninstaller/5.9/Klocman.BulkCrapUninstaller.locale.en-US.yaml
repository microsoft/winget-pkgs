ShortDescription: Bulk program uninstaller with advanced automation. It excels at removing large amounts of applications with minimal to no user input, while requiring next to no technical knowledge.
Description: |-
  Bulk Crap Uninstaller (or BCUninstaller) is a free (as in speech) program uninstaller.
  It excels at removing large amounts of applications with minimal user input.
  It can clean up leftovers, detect orphaned applications, run uninstallers according to premade lists, and much more!
  Even though BCU was made with IT pros in mind, by default it is so straight-forward that anyone can use it.

  BCU is fully compatible with Windows Store Apps, Steam, Windows Features and has special support for many uninstalling systems (NSIS, InnoSetup, Msiexec, and many other).

ReleaseNotes: |-
  What's Changed
  Packaging Changes
  - The setup is now significantly smaller and no longer includes the portable version.
  - BCU is now distributed as a framework-dependent application. If .NET 6 is not installed, the installer will automatically download and install it. If you need a stand-alone build like in the previous releases, download the portable version.
  Code Signing
  - BCU executables and installer are no longer signed. While signing helped reduce false antivirus detections, it also caused some issues. For more details, see discussion #737. Code signing may return if a solution is found.
