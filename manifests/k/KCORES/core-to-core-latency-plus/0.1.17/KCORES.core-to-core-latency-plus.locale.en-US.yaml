ShortDescription: Measures the latency between CPU cores, forked from nviennot/core-to-core-latency
Description: |-
  core-to-core-latency-plus is used to calculate the communication latency between CPU cores.
  Specifically, it fixes two threads on two different CPU cores and measures the latency by having the threads perform a series of compare-and-swap operations through the CPU cache coherence protocol.
  This fork aims to improve the usability of the program and collect more CPU benchmark data for display.
