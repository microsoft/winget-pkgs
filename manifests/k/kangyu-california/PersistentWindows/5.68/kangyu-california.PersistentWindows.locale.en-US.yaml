Description: |
  This project addresses a long-standing issue in Windows 7, 10, and 11, where windows get repositioned after events such as the system waking up, external monitor connections or disconnections, changes in monitor resolution (e.g., exiting full-screen gaming), or during RDP reconnections. The code was forked from ninjacrab.com/persistent-windows.
ReleaseNotes: |-
  1. [#411, #388] Add command option -no_inherit_process "EXCEL.exe;javaw" to disable auto restore new window for Excel and javaw processes
  2. [#384] Add command option -restore_disk_capture ["name_of_capture"] to restore windows from (named) capture on hard drive and then exit. If "name_of_capture" is omitted, the default anonymous disk capture is assumed. Note that a second restore using the same command line is needed to restore position/size of new windows launched in the first restore.
  3. Fix missing auto restore due to Windows .NET Framework randomly fail to deliver display config changed event to PW.
  4. [#408] Fix more exceptions.
  5. Avoid auto capture and restore in full-screen gaming mode.
