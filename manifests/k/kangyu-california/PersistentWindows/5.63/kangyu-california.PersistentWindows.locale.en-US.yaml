  This project addresses a long-standing issue in Windows 7, 10, and 11, where windows get repositioned after events such as the system waking up, external monitor connections or disconnections, changes in monitor resolution (e.g., exiting full-screen gaming), or during RDP reconnections. The code was forked from ninjacrab.com/persistent-windows.
ReleaseNotes: |-
  1. Re-enable -auto_restore_new_window_to_last_capture by default with improved matching algorithm (#369, #388, #392). To demonstrate the feature, open a dos cmd window, move it, then close it, and open a new dos cmd window again, and it should relocate to last killed position.
  2. Fix dead-loop trimming position history due to data corruption triggered by wrong window matching.
  3. Turn off auto restore existing windows during PW startup if computer is up more than 5 minutes, indicating user is upgrading/restarting PW and not expecting the auto-restore.
  4. Tentative fix for bug #395 (auto restore fail to start when display config changes) introduced since 5.6x
  5. Keep webpage commander window inactive when user enters text on web page.
