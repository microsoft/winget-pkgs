  This project addresses a long-standing issue in Windows 7, 10, and 11, where windows get repositioned after events such as the system waking up, external monitor connections or disconnections, changes in monitor resolution (e.g., exiting full-screen gaming), or during RDP reconnections. The code was forked from ninjacrab.com/persistent-windows.
ReleaseNotes: |-
  1. New feature: Swap the position of the foreground window with a background window by Alt + Click the background window.
     - This feature is useful after updating multi-window apps like google chrome, when window positions are incorrectly swapped due to failure of PW to match new window with killed one.
     - The foreground and background window must share the same process name.
     - This feature can be turned off by command option -swap_window_pos_when_alt_activate=0
  2. #435, add uninstall.bat script to remove auto-start task and high-dpi registry (created by auto start script) and private application data directory (created by PW). User still need to manually delete the unzipped PW dir.
  3. Fix crash and exceptions.
