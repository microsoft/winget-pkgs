ShortDescription: An open-source Kubernetes security platform for your IDE, CI/CD pipelines, and clusters
Description: Kubescape is an open-source Kubernetes security platform. It includes risk analysis, security compliance, and misconfiguration scanning. Targeted at the DevSecOps practitioner or platform engineer, it offers an easy-to-use CLI interface, flexible output formats, and automated scanning capabilities. It saves Kubernetes users and admins precious time, effort, and resources.  Kubescape scans clusters, YAML files, and Helm charts. It detects misconfigurations according to multiple frameworks (including NSA-CISA, MITRE ATT&CKÂ® and the CIS Benchmark).  Kubescape was created by ARMO and is a Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) sandbox project.
