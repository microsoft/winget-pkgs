  - Bug fixes made since ParaView 6.0.0 are listed below:
  - The "Fast" color map, which is the new default in ParaView 6.0.0, was not correctly defined in the ParaView 6.0.0 release. Its color space was set to "Diverging" rather than "Lab". As a result, the central lightest point in the color map was shifted to the left of center and was too bright.
  - Comparison of incorrect "Fast" color map in ParaView 6.0.0 (upper legend) vs. corrected "Fast" color map in ParaView 6.0.1 (lower legend).
