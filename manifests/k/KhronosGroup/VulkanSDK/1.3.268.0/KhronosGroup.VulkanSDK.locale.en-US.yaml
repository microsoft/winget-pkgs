      The Vulkan SDK is comprised of 100% open-source components. The majority of the materials are MIT or Apache 2.0 licenses. The Vulkan SDK licensing registry (found at vulkan.lunarg.com) discloses all components in the SDK and their corresponding open source license. The SDK itself is not licensed because to do so would re-attribute licenses to all the things included in the SDK.
