  Features

  Launch Multiple Connections from the Same Resource
  VAUL-7997: You can now start multiple sessions in parallel from a single PAM resource (or Template). The Connection Dock groups all active sessions under the same parent resource for easier management. Each session is handled independently, and ending one session from the connection dock won’t affect the others.
  Highlights
  - Launch additional sessions from the same resource without duplicating it
  - Templates can also launch multiple sessions without creating duplicate resources
  - Connection Dock groups sessions under the resource/template with unique session details
  - From the resource record, you can search for and bring an active connection into focus.
  - From the resource record, you can terminate all active sessions associated with that resource.

  Getting Started
  To launch multiple connections, open the resource record you want to use. After you click Launch and the first connection is active, a dropdown caret appears next to the Launch button. Use this menu and select Launch New Connection to start another session from the same resource.

  Each new connection is numbered in the order it was opened

  Open Active Connections lets you search for and jump to an active connection for that resource, making it easy to find and return to a session while you’re working in the Vault.

  One-Time Share (OTS) is now supported on GovCloud
  OST-59: This enables secure, bidirectional one-time sharing so you can both send and receive signed documents, feedback, and sensitive files or information from clients, contractors, legal teams, and others—without requiring recipients to create a Keeper account.
