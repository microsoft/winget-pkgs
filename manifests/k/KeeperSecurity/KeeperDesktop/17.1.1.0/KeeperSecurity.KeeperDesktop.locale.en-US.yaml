  Enhancements
  - VAUL-6349: Updated the Security Audit tab in Vault to ensure the overall Security Audit score matches the per-user score in the Admin Console, reducing confusion.

  Other Updates
  - KDE-1534: Updated new installs to default to the native browser for SSO authentication instead of the app browser.
  - VAUL-7176: Fixed an issue where setting up a hardware security key required extra steps; the Vault now prioritizes it using the “hints” syntax.
  - VAUL-7262: PAM Updated router calls to use the /api/user path for commands.

  Bug Fixes
  - KDE-1607, 1606, 1608, and 1619: The SSH Agent will scan General typed records for private key file attachments
  - KDE-1611: Fixed an issue where selecting Two-Factor Authentication triggered the Offline Access dialog.
  - VAUL-7094: Fixed an issue preventing master password login when session resumption and 2FA were enabled
  - VAUL-6787: Fixed an issue where the folder structure in Delete Items did not match the folder structure in Vault.
  - VAUL-6394: Fixed an issue where the Web Vault allowed uploads past the storage limit; users are now blocked when the limit is reached.
  - VAUL-6090: Fixed an issue where shortcut-linked records were not retained in shared folders after CSV export/import, preventing data loss.
  - VAUL-5989: Fixed an issue where the password font displayed incorrectly when Japanese was selected on Windows 10/11.
  - VAUL-6902: Fixed an issue where restoring a file attachment record caused repeated error messages and made attachments inaccessible in the Web Vault.
  - VAUL-7095: Fixed an issue where creating a new record with a file attachment showed an empty record state instead of the record details.
  - VAUL-7104: Fixed an issue where switching to Suomi/Svenska caused a Content Security Policy error in Stack.
  - VAUL-7102: Fixed an issue where importing from Proton Pass did not include login details.
  - VAUL-7109: Fixed an issue where "Share only in SF allowed" displayed the wrong modal in OTS.
  - VAUL-6826: Fixed an issue where V3 records generated an error when viewing or downloading attachments.
  - VAUL-7155: Fixed an issue where sharing a record to an account with an invalid email format failed silently instead of displaying an error message.

  - VAUL-7184: Fixed an issue where failed invite attempts incorrectly showed a success message instead of an error.
  - VAUL-7216: Fixed an issue where Firefox always assumed a security key was inserted for 2FA, preventing access to alternative methods; a modal now informs the user.
  - VAUL-7219: PAM: Fixed an issue where the Gateway button was not visible despite the appropriate permissions being enabled.
  - VAUL-7264: Fixed an issue where the Save & Share button remained disabled after validation.
