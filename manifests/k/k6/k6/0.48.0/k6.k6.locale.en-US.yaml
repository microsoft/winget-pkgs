ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Numerous long-awaited breaking changes.
  - A new k6 new subcommand to generate a new test script.
  - A new k6/experimental/fs module for file interactions.
  - CPU and network throttling support for the k6 browser module.
  - #3448 limits metric names, aligning to both OpenTelemetry (OTEL) and Prometheus name requirements, while still being limited to 128 ASCII characters.
    Warnings about the limit started in v0.45.
  - #3439 changes the Client signature in k6/experimental/redis module.
    Refer to the module-related section below.
  - #3350 removes the grpc.invoke()'s parameter headers, deprecated in k6 v0.37. Use the metadata parameter instead.
  - #3389 removes the --logformat flag, deprecated in v0.38. Use the --log-format flag instead.
  - #3390 removes all CSV output's CLI arguments, deprecated in v0.35. This change makes the CSV output consistent with other output formats.
  - #3365 removes the k6 convert CLI command, deprecated in v0.41. Use the har-to-k6 package instead.
  - #3451 removes logic that would attempt to prepend a https:// scheme to module specifiers that were not recognized. Deprecated in k6 v0.25.
    Use full URLs if you want to load remote modules instead.
  - proto: Specifies the protocol to use in the connection to the traces backend.
    Supports grpc (default) and http.
  - header.<header_name>: Specifies an additional header to include in the connection to the traces backend.
  - Minimum latency from request sent to response headers received (ms).
  - Maximal aggregated download throughput (bytes/sec). -1 disables download
  - throttling.
  - Maximal aggregated upload throughput (bytes/sec). -1 disables upload
  - throttling.
  UX improvements and enhancements
  - browser#1074 adds a new browser.closeContext() method to facilitate closing the current active browser context.
  - #3370 adds a new flag --profiling-enabled which enables exposing pprof profiling endpoints. The profiling endpoints are exposed on the same port as the HTTP REST API under the /debug/pprof/ path.
    This can be useful for extension developers.
  - #3442 adds a new --version flag, which has the same output as k6 version command. Thanks, @ffapitalle!
  - #3423 adds an environment variable K6_INFLUXDB_PROXY to the InfluxDB output which allows specifying proxy.
    Thanks, @IvanovOleg!
  - #3398 enables k6 cloud traces by default.
  - #3400 sets a binary-based cloud output (a.k.a. cloud output v2) as the default version for streaming metrics from a local test run via -o cloud.
  - #3452 adds fsext.Abs helper function.
  Bug fixes
  - #3380 corrects console.debug(), aligning -v output to --console-output and stdout.
  - #3416 prints the stack trace when there's an exception in handleSummary().
  - #3438 prevents an error on HTTP requests with content-encoding header and HTTP statuses known for having no body.
  - browser#1077 fixes browserContext.clearPermissions to clear permissions without panic.
  - browser#1042 fixes browserContext.waitForEvent which involved promisifying the waitForEvent API.
  - browser#1078 fixes request interception deadlock to improve stability.
  - browser#1101 fixes page.$ so that it returns null when no matches with given selector are found.
  - #3397, #3427, #3417 update goja dependency. Fixes a possible panic and proper handling circular types at JSON.stringify.
    Fixes an issue about dumping the correct stack trace when an error is re-thrown.
  - browser#1106 fixes an NPE on NavigateFrame when navigate occurs in the same document.
  - browser#1096 fixes a panic when trying to interact within nested iframes. Thanks, @bandorko!
