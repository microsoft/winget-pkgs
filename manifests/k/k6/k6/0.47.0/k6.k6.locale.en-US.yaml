ReleaseNotes: |-
  Deprecations
  - #3347 The built-in statsd output option has been deprecated, and users should use the xk6-output-statsd extension instead.
    See #2982 for future plans.
  - #3288 Loading remote modules now requires users to prepend them with https://.
    Before, k6 would try to resolve importing remote modules by prepending https:// if it was missing.
