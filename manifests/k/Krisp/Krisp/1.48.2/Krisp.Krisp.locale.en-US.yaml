  Win 1.48.2 - Improvements and bug fixes

  Improvements
  - As an Enterprise Admin, you can now enable the Call Center specific model of Noise Cancellation for your team users. With this:
    - a lighter version of Inbound Noise Cancellation will be applied to all the team users,
    - the Background Voice Cancellation will be adjusted to make sure that the agent's voice isn't distorted when the user's device
     is under high load or when the Low Power Usage mode for Noise Cancellation is manually turned on.

  Bug fixes ü™≤
  We fixed the cases when Krisp update would fail with the "Krisp was not able to install the update because of inconsistency‚Äù message.
  We addressed the problem when Krisp would show an available update while you have the latest version installed.
