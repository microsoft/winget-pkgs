ShortDescription: UMDT is a comprehensive Python-based toolkit for diagnosing, simulating, and bridging Modbus devices (RTU/TCP). It includes an interactive tool, a mock server, and a soft-proxy with PCAP support.
Description: 'UMDT is a comprehensive toolkit designed for engineers and developers working with Modbus (RTU/TCP) devices. It simplifies tasks such as: Diagnosing: Reading/writing registers, scanning address ranges, and identifying devices; Simulating: Creating virtual Modbus slaves with configurable behavior and fault injection; Bridging: Routing traffic between different transports (e.g., TCP to Serial) and modifying packets on the fly; Sniffing: Capturing and analyzing Modbus traffic for forensic debugging.'
