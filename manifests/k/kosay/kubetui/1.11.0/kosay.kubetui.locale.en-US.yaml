  What's New
  Features
  Drag-to-Scroll Text Selection (#880, #885)
  Added tmux-like drag-to-scroll functionality for text selection in log views:
  - Automatic scrolling at boundaries: When dragging text selection to the top or bottom edge (1st line or last line), the view automatically scrolls in that direction
  - Continuous auto-scroll: When the mouse stops moving at boundaries, scrolling continues automatically every 200ms
  - Expanding selection area: The selection range expands automatically during auto-scroll
  - Horizontal scrolling support: Works for horizontal scrolling when text wrapping is disabled
  - Performance optimized: Auto-scroll only processes the active widget
  This enhancement makes it much easier to select and copy large portions of log data without multiple manual scroll operations.
  Technical Details
  - Uses existing Tick worker (200ms interval) for periodic updates
  - Tracks dragging widget to continue event routing when cursor moves outside widget bounds
  - Stores last mouse position and scroll direction for smooth auto-scroll behavior
