ReleaseNotes: |-
  New Features
  - Runtime customization of pod table columns (#779)
    Customize which columns are shown in the pod table while the app is running.
    Press t to open the column selection dialog, use Space/Enter to toggle visibility, and J/K to reorder columns.
    Required columns like NAME are always visible and cannot be deselected.
  - Column presets for pod view (#783)
    Define reusable column presets in config.yaml under pod.column_presets.
    Load a preset at startup with --pod-columns-preset.
    Optionally, set a default preset with pod.default_preset to apply automatically when no CLI option is provided.
    Priority (highest to lowest):
    - --pod-columns
    - --pod-columns-preset
    - config.yaml default_preset
    - built-in default
  - New UI component: CheckList
    Supports multi-selection, required items, reordering, and theming.
    Used in the pod column selection dialog.
  - Enum-based PodColumn
    Switched from string-based to a type-safe enum.
    Added FromStr parsing, sorting, hashing, and improved overall safety and maintainability.
  Improvements & Refactor
  - Extracted shared column building logic into convert_columns.
  - Improved deduplication logic to preserve user-defined column order.
  - Clarified CLI help text and updated README instructions.
  - Added footer to the pod column dialog showing available key bindings:
    [Space/Enter] to toggle, [J/K] to move.
  Documentation
  - Expanded README with details and usage examples for column presets.
  - Added a help dialog section explaining runtime customization of pod columns.
  Fixes
  - Fixed an issue where duplicate columns could appear in the pod view.
  - Updated the sample config: reordered columns and added the IP column for better defaults.
