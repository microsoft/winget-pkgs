  What's Changed
  Bug Fixes
  - Workaround kube-rs not respecting NO_PROXY (#919) - Fixed an issue where the NO_PROXY environment variable was not being respected by kube-rs, causing requests to bypass proxy exclusion rules.
  - Enable kube http-proxy feature for proxy support (#924) - The http-proxy feature was not enabled in the kube dependency, which meant that proxy configuration (HTTP_PROXY/HTTPS_PROXY) was not actually being applied to kube-rs HTTP connections.
