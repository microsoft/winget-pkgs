ShortDescription: An Open Source project for fast and easy development and execution of automated tests.
Description: |-
  OpenTAP is an Open Source project for fast and easy development and execution of automated tests.
  OpenTAP is built with simplicity, scalability and speed in mind, and is based on an extendable architecture that leverages .NET.
  OpenTAP offers a range of sequencing functionality and infrastructure that makes it possible for you to quickly develop plugins tailored for your automation needs – plugins that can be shared with the OpenTAP community through the OpenTAP package repository.

  Highlights
  EULA support in package XML
  You can now add a End User License Agreement to the package XML. This should point to either a file located in the package or a web page containing the EULA.
  Once the user tries to use your plugin, they will be prompted with a message to accept the EULA before proceeding.
  Better handling of overriding a package dependency in package XML
  Previously additional dependencies would be added when explicitly overriding dependencies in the package XML. Now, it will avoid adding dependencies that not expected to be needed.
  API: Allow XmlIgnore on EmbedProperties
  You can now use XmlIgnoreAttribute on objects marked with the EmbedProperties. This will have the effect that none of the properties added by the embedded object will be serialized.
  API: SupportedModelsAttribute
  This new attribute allows an instrument (usually) to specify which instrument models it supports. This information will be added to the package XML, so that other tools can use the information.
  At the moment there is no runtime behavioral changes for instruments using it and not.
  Package XML: Package Validation
  This feature is mostly useful for system-wide packages, that can be uninstalled through other means than uninstalling the package. For example, the add/remove apps menu in the Windows Control panel.
  It adds the possibility of adding a health check for a package, so that it is possible to see if a package is correctly installed or not.
  For example, the PathWave License Manager package XML now comes with the following statement:
  <Validation>
      <FileExists Path="%SystemDrive%\Program Files\Common Files\Keysight\PathWave License Manager\bin\pwlmgr.exe"/>
  </Validation>
  This means that if that file does not exist, the package should probably be reinstalled next time you run the installer.
