  Security fixes
  GHSA-prcj-7rvc-26h4
  - 9351354: tweak electron fuses (Eugene)
  It was in theory possible (on macOS) for other applications to exploit the TCC permissions (microphone/camera) previous given to Tabby by the user for malicious purposes by abusing NODE_OPTIONS env var or the debug mode. This is now fixed by disabling the corresponding Electron fuses.
  Fixes

  - case-insensitive hostname check (#10130) #10130 (Hiroaki Ogasawara)
