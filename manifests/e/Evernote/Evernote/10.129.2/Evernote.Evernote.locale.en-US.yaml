  New features:
  - Daily Notes just got better! Now, you can set any of your templates as your Daily Note and choose in which Notebooks they appear.
  - You now have complete control over your font size! Enter any value you want for even more precise text formatting.
  - You can now control whether typing "/" allows you to insert elements in a note and whether typing "@" lets you link other notes. Adjust these settings anytime under Settings > Notes.
  - You can now navigate to the Templates section using CMD/CTRL+ALT+9 shortcut.

  Fixes:
  - Fixed an issue where numbers in ordered lists did not match the style of the text.
  - Fixed an issue where using "Find in Note" while an existing search was active did not properly refocus the cursor on the search box.
