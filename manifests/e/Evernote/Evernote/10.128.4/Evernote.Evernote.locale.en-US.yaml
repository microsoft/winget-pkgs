  New features:
  - Sidebar customization is now more easily accessible through the More button in the sidebar. Enable this button from Settings if it's not there.
  - You can now add suggested templates to a note! Click on My Templates in a blank note and pin or unpin the templates you want to appear as suggestions.
  - Hovering on a pinned note now displays the note title.

  Fixes:
  - Fixed a bug where applying templates to empty notes updated the note creation date.
  - Fixed an issue where tasks in the editor were not showing whether they had a reminder.
