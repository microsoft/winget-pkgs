  New Features:
  - You can now quickly open a note in a new window using a keyboard shortcut (CMD+O on Mac and ALT+O on Windows).
  - We have improved the sharing dialog to show not just direct collaborators, but also those who can access your note indirectly (like via a public link). Now, you're always in the know!

  Fixes:
  - Solved a glitch where the Recent Notes previews were flashing while writing on the Scratch Pad or changing tabs in the Recently captured widget.
  - Resolved a problem that prevented users from dragging and dropping notes into sidebar notebooks.
