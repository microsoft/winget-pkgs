  New features:
  - A major update to Search is being rolled out. It now opens front and center for better focus, offers smarter and more relevant suggestions as you type, and features a refreshed default view that highlights recent and recommended content, making it faster and easier to find what you need.
  - You can now show or hide the note list using the button in the top-left corner of your note. Or use the shortcut CMD/CTRL + Alt + V to switch between views.
  - Shared notes now show a "Shared with me" section in the breadcrumb at the top of the note.

  Fixes:
  - Fixed an issue where the selected task priority wasn't properly highlighted and could not be removed
  - Fixed an issue that prevented the app from scrolling to the correct result when the match was found in the note title
  - Fixed an issue that affected typing inside text fields in Japanese and Korean
  - Fixed an issue that occasionally caused sidebar preferences to reset unexpectedly
  - Fixed an issue where clicking on a pinned note in a Space would incorrectly redirect users to the Home screen
