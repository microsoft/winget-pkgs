ShortDescription: Redirect Edge calls to your favorite browser!
Description: GoAwayEdge is designed for those who, like me, aren’t fans of Microsoft Edge. If you find yourself constantly annoyed by Edge popping up unexpectedly, fear not! This clever utility redirects all Edge-related calls to your preferred browser, ensuring a seamless browsing experience.
