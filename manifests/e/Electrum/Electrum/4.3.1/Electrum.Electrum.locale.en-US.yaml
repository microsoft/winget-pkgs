ShortDescription: Lightweight Bitcoin client
Description: |-
  Electrum is an easy to use Bitcoin wallet. It protects you from losing coins in a backup mistake or computer failure, because your wallet can be recovered from a secret phrase that you can write on paper or learn by heart.
  There is no waiting time when you start the client, because it does not download the Bitcoin blockchain.
