ReleaseNotes: |-
  For everyone
  UX
  - ENVI-core: Reduced simulation times by 20-50% (depending on model area size) through optimized background processes
  - Leonardo: Decreased loading times when opening outputs (especially larger models)
  - NetCDF libraries are now bundled with ENVI-met and no longer need to be installed separately
  - NetCDF files are automatically generated during simulation
  - Nesting cells are per default not written into the outputs anymore
  - Added the option to opt-out of email notifications through a tag in the .SIMX
  UI
  - Added “Advanced Settings” toggle in Leonardo and Spaces to access older options
  Bugfixes
  - Leonardo: Fixed the display of wind vectors
  - ENVI-core: Fixed a greening module issue and corrected the amount of reflected shortwave radiation
  - OAuth: Fixed a bug preventing to log in again after PC went into stand-by
  For business users
  - Web-Based Reporting Tool: Easily upload your simulation data to your new personal project cloud, to explore it through our new interactive visualization tool, and to generate professional reports tailored for stakeholders
  - Running isolated modules: ENVI-met now allows single-module simulations for solar radiation and wind. This enables focused environmental analyses without running a full holistic model, significantly reducing simulation time when only specific factors are needed
