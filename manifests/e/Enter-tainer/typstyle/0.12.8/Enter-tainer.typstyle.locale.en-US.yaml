ShortDescription: Beautiful and reliable typst code formatter

ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Typstyle will format binary expressions as operator chains. Parentheses are added if necessary.
  - Formatting chains with comments is supported now. This is the last piece of formatting with comments.
  - Dot chains in markup with parentheses will be broken into multiple lines, if the it contains at least two dots and one function calls.
  For example, the following code:
  #let _is_block(e,fn)=fn==heading or (fn==math.equation and e.block) or (fn==raw and e.has("block") and e.block) or fn==figure or fn==block or fn==list.item or fn==enum.item or fn==table or fn==grid or fn==align or (fn==quote and e.has("block") and e.block)
  Will be formatted as this in previous versions:
  #let _is_block(e, fn) = (
    fn == heading or (fn == math.equation and e.block) or (
      fn == raw and e.has("block") and e.block
    ) or fn == figure or fn == block or fn == list.item or fn == enum.item or fn == table or fn == grid or fn == align or (
      fn == quote and e.has("block") and e.block
    )
  )
  Now it will be formatted as:
  #let _is_block(e, fn) = (
    fn == heading
      or (fn == math.equation and e.block)
      or (fn == raw and e.has("block") and e.block)
      or fn == figure
      or fn == block
      or fn == list.item
      or fn == enum.item
      or fn == table
      or fn == grid
      or fn == align
      or (fn == quote and e.has("block") and e.block)
  )
