ShortDescription: Beautiful and reliable typst code formatter

ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Fix: musl build is now statically linked. This fixes the issue that the musl build doesn't work on systems other than alpine.
  - Typstyle now break content blocks into multiple lines if they have leading spaces and trailing spaces.
  For example, the following code is not formattable by typstyle previously:
  #{
    let res = if true [ The Result is definitely true. And it is a very long sentence that needs to be broken into multiple lines. ] else [ The Result is definitely false. And it is a very long sentence that needs to be broken into multiple lines. ]
  }
  Now it will be formatted as:
  #{
    let res = if true [
      The Result is definitely true. And it is a very long sentence that needs to be broken into multiple lines.
    ] else [
      The Result is definitely false. And it is a very long sentence that needs to be broken into multiple lines.
    ]
  }
