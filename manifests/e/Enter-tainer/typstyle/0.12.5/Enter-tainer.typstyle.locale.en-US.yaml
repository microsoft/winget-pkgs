ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Typstyle can format comments appears in most places. Previously it simply gives up when it encounters comments in these places. Now it can format them correctly.
  For example, this code:
  #let conf(
    title: none,   //comments
    authors:      (),
    abstract: [],
    lang: "zh",   // language
    doctype: "book",  //comments
    doc  // my docs
  ) = {
      doc }
  Previously typstyle will not format it. Now it will be formatted as:
  #let conf(
    title: none, //comments
    authors: (),
    abstract: [],
    lang: "zh", // language
    doctype: "book", //comments
    doc, // my docs
  ) = {
    doc
  }
  However, there are still some limitations. For more information, see Limitation.
  - Fix typstyle previously would format parenthesized patterns incorrectly into none. Now it is fixed.
