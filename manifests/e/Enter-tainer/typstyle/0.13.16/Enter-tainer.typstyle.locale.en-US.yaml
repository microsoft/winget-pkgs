ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Due to ci configuration issues, we failed to publish v0.13.15. This release is a re-publish of v0.13.15 with the correct version number.
  v0.13.15 - [2025-07-18]
  - Feature(CLI): Add --diff option to show unified diff of formatting changes. This allows users to preview what changes would be made before applying formatting.
    For example:
    typstyle file.typ --diff
    Output:
    --- file.typ
    +++ file.typ

    -#let x=1+2
    -#let y=(3*4)
    +#let x = 1 + 2
    +#let y = (3 * 4)
  - Feature: Improve comment handling - line comments are now treated as line suffixes instead of separate lines, resulting in more compact and natural formatting.
    For example, The following code will be accepted by typstyle now:
    #let result = (x + y) / 2 + 1  // This comment stays on same line
    But it will be formatted to this in previous versions. Note that the comment was moved to a new line, which is not ideal for inline comments.
    // line width = 40
    #let result = (
      (x + y) / 2 + 1
    )  // This comment stays on same line
  - Feature: Add support for sharing links in the web playground, making it easier to share formatted code snippets with others for demo or collaboration.
  - Performance: Bump prettyless to v0.3.0. This slightly improves performance and lowers memory consumption during formatting.
