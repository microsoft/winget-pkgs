ReleaseNotes: |-
  Core
  - Feature: Improved flavor detection for list-like syntaxes.
    Previously, flavor detection checked only whether the first space contained a line break, leading to unexpected multiline layout when child expressions contained line breaks or spaces. Now, a list-like syntax is considered multiline only if there is a space containing a line break before its first child expression.
    For example, this code was previously treated as multiline due to the line break before ), but now uses the compact layout:
    #f(it => it
    )
  - Feature: Aligned equation flavor detection with other nodes.
    For example,
    $ a
    $
    was previously regarded as multiline due to the break before the closing $. Now it formats as
    $ a $
    enabling inline block switching by adjusting the space after the opening $.
  - Feature: Raw blocks are combinable now.
  - Feature: Compact layout for markup.
    For a content block, strong, or emph node, if its opening boundary is non-breakable, contains no breaks, and has exactly one primary expression (excluding labels, break symbols, and plain text), it is rendered without indentation.
  - Feature: Indent the body of strong or emph expressions when not using the compact layout.
  - Fix: Corrected misplaced standalone comments in method chains.
    In this example,
    #(
      foo
        // comment
        .bar()
    )
    it previously formatted as
    #(
      foo // comment
        .bar()
    )
    Now the comment correctly stays on its own line.
  - Fix: Prevent reflow of text segments that can be parsed as enum item markers.
    text 01.
    Previously formatted as
    text
    01.
    which created an unintended enum item. Now it remains on one line.
  - Fix: Do not insert an extra break at a nil boundary for headings. Now the code
    #[= h1]
    will not be formatted as
    #[
      = h1
    ]
    in any case.
  Playground
  - Feature: Use system color preference as the default theme.
  - Feature: Persist the current state (code and options) in the URL for easy sharing.
  - Feature: Store source code in local storage; if absent from the URL, the stored code is used as a fallback.
  - Feature: Enable in-place formatting (full document or selection) in the source editor.
  - Feature: Added a loading spinner and error boundary.
  - Feature: Toggle word wrap in the source editor.
  - Feature: Option to display only the formatted selection’s output.
  - Feature: Reduced indentation size in the output AST/IR from 4 spaces to 2.
  Documentation
  - Feature: Switched documentation theme from mdBook to Starlight.
  - Feature: Added “copy code” support.
  Miscellaneous
  - Moved the benchmark-results repository to the typstyle-rs organization.
