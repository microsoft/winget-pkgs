ShortDescription: Beautiful and reliable typst code formatter

ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Bug fix: typstyle previously will break inline equations if they has alignments. Now it is fixed. It will never add paddings to align inline equations now.
  - Feature: typstyle doesn't enforce trailing backslash in math equations with alignments now.
  - Feature: Previously, typstyle will try to put the last argument of a function call in the same line as the function call when certain conditions are met. Now it is enhanced. In this version, if the last argument is an array or a dict, typstyle will only do this if it is the only array/dict argument.
