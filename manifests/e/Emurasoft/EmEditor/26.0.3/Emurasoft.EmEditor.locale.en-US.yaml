ReleaseNotes: |-
  EmEditor v26.0.3 is now available. This release focuses on stability and includes the fixes below. We recommend updating to the latest version for the best experience.
  - Fixed an issue introduced in v26.0.0 that could cause a crash when running Replace or Delete on a multi-selection containing line breaks.
  - Fixed an issue introduced in v26.0.0 where certain actions—such as Find, Replace, and filtering—might not be recorded in macros.
  - Fixed an issue introduced in v26.0.0 where the “File types” list in the standard Open dialog could sometimes appear incorrectly.
  If you use the Desktop Installer edition, update from Help > Check for Updates. If that doesn’t work, download the latest version and run the installer. We expect the Microsoft Store release in the next few days. If you download the MSI directly, please confirm that the digital signature is signed by Emurasoft, Inc.
