ReleaseNotes: |-
  We’re excited to announce the release of EmEditor v24.5.0. We strongly recommend all users update to this new version.
  Many users depend on EmEditor for managing large files daily, so ensuring seamless opening, editing, and saving is essential. However, from versions v22.4.0 to v24.4.1, there was an issue where file sizes could increase when reopening large files (around 300MB or more) from certain hard drives, even though the first opening was fine. This was reported by a customer, and we appreciate his feedback and apologize for any inconvenience. This issue didn’t occur with fast hard drives like SSDs, but on slower drives with disk cache enabled, duplicate lines could appear. We fixed this in v24.4.2. In v24.5, we’ve added code to prevent such unknown issues by showing a message if there’s an internal file size inconsistency. Therefore, we strongly recommend all users update to v24.5.
  Additionally, v24.5 introduces a new Verify command in the File menu. By selecting this command right after opening a file, you can save the current document as a temporary file and compare its size and SHA256 hash value with the original file.
  The dialog that is initially displayed when using the Verify command.
  The results are displayed in the File Verification Results dialog box, and you can copy the size and SHA256 hash value. Normally, the original and temporary files should match in size and hash value. However, discrepancies might occur if the original file contains NULL or invalid characters, or if there are hard drive or memory errors. For important files, please use the Verify command immediately after opening to ensure everything is correct.
  The File Verification Results dialog box provides information about the outcome of the file verification process. The current document is saved as a temporary file, and its size and SHA256 hash value are compared to the original.
  Added the Verify files immediately after opening and Display verification results only if there is a failure check boxes to the File page of the Customize dialog box.
  We’ve also added an option in the File page of the Customize dialog box for automatic verification every time a file is loaded.
  The new version (v24.5) also includes several other features, many of which were requested by users.
  When dealing with large files, it can be convenient to open only a smaller section and navigate to the previous or next section by clicking a button. This was suggested by a customer. In v24.5, we’ve added << and >> buttons to the Large File Controller, allowing you to move to the previous or next section within a specified size range.
  The << and >> buttons have been added to the Large File Controller.
  We’ve improved the AI-assisted writing feature by expanding the options available with the OpenAI API, which was initially introduced in version 24.1. Previously, suggested text would automatically appear in gray as you typed. Now, you have the option to display suggestions only when you press Ctrl+Space, which helps reduce the frequency of OpenAI API calls. If you prefer the automatic display of suggestions like before, they will only appear when the AI’s suggestion meets a certain confidence threshold, which you can now adjust. For instance, if you set the confidence to 40%, the AI will show suggestions only when it predicts the next text with at least 40% confidence. To minimize suggestions from less certain predictions, you can set a higher confidence, like 80%, ensuring that suggestions are shown only when predictions are more reliable, thus reducing the number of OpenAI API calls. Additionally, we’ve added options to adjust the length of the input text used for predictions and the output text for candidate suggestions. Using longer input text for predictions increases accuracy but also raises the OpenAI API usage fee. Similarly, longer output text results in more words being suggested.
  Added the AI Assist page to the Configuration Properties dialog box.
  Moreover, based on a request from a customer, we’ve made it so that pasting in the Chat with AI window won’t immediately send the message.
  Bugs found during the preview version development have been fixed.
  Finally, while EmEditor requires an internet connection for product activation, some environments need a proxy for internet access. In this version, we’ve added a Proxy Settings link in the Register Product dialog, enabling you to configure proxy settings easily. The desktop installer now includes a PROXY option for command line installation.
