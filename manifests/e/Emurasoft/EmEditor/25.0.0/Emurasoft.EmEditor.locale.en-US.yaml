ReleaseNotes: |-
  We are pleased to announce the release of EmEditor v25.0.0.
  Since EmEditor Professional v23.1, we have introduced several generative AI-related features powered by OpenAI. While many users have welcomed these additions, some corporate customers have raised concerns about security. Although disabling AI features within EmEditor prevents their use in the editor itself, it doesn’t completely eliminate potential access to AI services through web browsers or other applications on an internet-connected computer. Nevertheless, we understand administrators’ desire to minimize the risk of sensitive file content being leaked from text editors. In v24.2, we introduced the option to fully disable AI features via administrative privileges; however, some administrators still felt uneasy about merely changing settings. Therefore, in this version, we’ve entirely removed AI-related features from the EmEditor core. Instead, AI functionality is now available separately through the downloadable ChatAI plugin. Without installing the ChatAI plugin, all AI-related commands and options will be completely hidden and unavailable within EmEditor. We recognize that some administrators might still have reservations, since users could easily download and install this free plugin. In such scenarios, we kindly ask administrators to consider that numerous other free AI-related tools developed by third parties are already publicly accessible online.
  EmEditor Professional no longer includes AI-related features by default. To keep using these features, you’ll need to download and install the ChatAI plug-in separately.
  On the other hand, if you choose to download and install the ChatAI plugin, all AI-related features will be conveniently grouped under a new AI menu, providing quick and easy access.
  After installing the plug-in, all AI-related commands will be conveniently grouped under a new AI menu.
  Please note that the ChatAI plugin is available exclusively for the 64-bit version of EmEditor. Additionally, since the Store version of EmEditor is a UWP (Universal Windows Platform) app running in an app container, it does not support external plugins. Therefore, AI features are unfortunately unavailable in the 32-bit and Store versions of EmEditor.
  This release also includes several improvements to AI-related features. First, when generating images, you can now choose between standard and HD resolutions. This option is accessible via the new HD checkbox in the New Prompt dialog and the AI Prompt page of the Customize dialog when selecting Image as the output type.
  A new HD checkbox has been added to the New Prompt dialog and the AI Prompt page in the Customize dialog when Image is selected for Output. If the HD checkbox is not selected, images will be generated at normal resolution (ChatAI plug-in).
  Second, we’ve added a Create New Document command to the context menu of the Chat with AI custom bar, allowing you to quickly display AI chat results in a single Markdown Design View document.
  Added the Create New Document command to the context menu in the Chat with AI custom bar (ChatAI plug-in).
  Third, we’ve introduced support for the gpt-4.5-preview OpenAI model.
  The gpt-4.5-preview model was added to the Preferred Model list box in the AI Options page of the Customize dialog box (ChatAI plug-in).
  As Markdown notation becomes increasingly widespread, we’ve observed a growing demand for conversion between Markdown and traditional HTML. This version adds dedicated commands for converting Markdown to HTML and vice versa, as well as commands to convert Markdown or HTML to plain text. For HTML-to-Markdown conversions, we utilize html2md by Tim Gromeyer. For Markdown-to-HTML and Markdown-to-plain-text conversions, we continue to rely on MD4C (Markdown parser for C) by Martin Mitáš.
  Added commands that allow you to convert between Markdown, HTML, and plain text.
  Additionally, this update addresses various customer requests, including enhancements to stacked custom bars, dark mode, the update checker (1, 2), the Find toolbar, and drag-and-drop behavior for macro files.
  We have also fixed bugs discovered during the development of the preview version.
  We hope you enjoy using EmEditor, whether you choose the Professional or Free version. Please contact us or write in our forums if you have any questions, feature requests, or suggestions.
  Thank you for using EmEditor!
