  - Resolved a recurring crash when loading a workspace.
  - Fixed a potential crash when clicking the “Find Next” button on the Find toolbar, especially when the “Search All Documents in Group” option is enabled and a window is split.
  - Fixed a bug where encountering a macro error would cause the cursor to jump to the wrong line in v24.4.x.
  - Fixed a bug present since v22.4 where EmEditor could read duplicate lines when opening very large files on a slower hard drive with disk caching enabled.
  - Fixed an issue where replacing with “\J” caused an error.
  - Fixed an issue where the file size wasn’t displayed immediately after opening a file.
