ReleaseNotes: |-
  Today, we are releasing EmEditor v25.1.3.
  v25.1.3 includes the following bug fixes. Please make sure to always update to the latest version for stable operations.
  - If a macro file does not have a Unicode signature (BOM), it will now be opened as UTF-8 instead of using the legacy system default encoding. It is recommended to save macros as either UTF-16 (with BOM) or UTF-8 (with BOM).
  - Fixed an issue in EmEditor Free where some options in the Customize Start Window dialog could not be saved.
  - Fixed customer reported issues (1, 2, 3, 4).
