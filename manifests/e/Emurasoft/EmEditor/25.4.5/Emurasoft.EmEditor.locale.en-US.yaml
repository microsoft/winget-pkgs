  If you’re using the Desktop Installer version, go to Help → Check for Updates to download the latest version. If that doesn’t work—or if you don’t currently have EmEditor installed—please download the installer and run it.
  EmEditor (desktop installer) is now also available from the Microsoft Store:

  Download Desktop Installer from Microsoft Store (Recommended)
  For earlier versions of Windows, you can download the installer directly here.
  If you download the MSI file directly, please verify that the digital signature is signed by “Emurasoft, Inc.”:
  1. Right-click the downloaded file and select Properties.
  2. Open the Digital Signatures tab.
  3. Confirm the signer is Emurasoft, Inc..
  4. Do not install the file under any circumstances unless the signer is Emurasoft, Inc..
  EmEditor’s Update Checker automatically verifies the MSI signer and cancels the update if the signer is not Emurasoft, Inc..
  Alternatively, you can verify the SHA-256 hash values:
