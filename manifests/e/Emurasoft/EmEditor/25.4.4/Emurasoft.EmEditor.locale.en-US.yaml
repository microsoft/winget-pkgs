ReleaseNotes: |-
  EmEditor v25.4.4 is now available. This release focuses on stability and includes the fixes listed below. We recommend updating to the latest version for the best experience.
  - Updated certain status bar items so they activate only on double-click, helping prevent accidental actions.
  - Fixed an issue where status bar tooltips (Read-Only Mode and other indicators) didn’t always appear when the related switch was turned off.
  - Fixed cases where Highlight Matching Tag could be unreliable in large HTML files.
  - Corrected behavior when opening a file that contains a NUL (NULL) character as a text file.
  - Fixed a potential crash in Replace in Files under certain conditions.
  - Fixed an issue affecting a Sync feature.
  - Allowed the Outline Bar to appear even when filtering is enabled.
  - Fixed a potential crash when filtering with an invalid number-range syntax.
  - Fixed incorrect information that could appear in the Registration Information/About dialog under certain conditions.
  - Fixed behavior when selecting Copy on the AI Prompts page in the Customize dialog.
  - Fixed an issue where the UI could switch to Chinese (instead of English) when the Windows display language was set to an unsupported language.
  If you’re using the Desktop Installer version, go to Help → Check for Updates to download the latest version. If that doesn’t work, please download the installer (emed64_25.4.4.msi) and run it.
  If you download the MSI file directly, please verify that the digital signature is signed by “Emurasoft, Inc.”:
  1. Right-click the downloaded file and select Properties.
  2. Open the Digital Signatures tab.
  3. Confirm the signer is Emurasoft, Inc.
  4. Do not install the file under any circumstances unless the signer is Emurasoft, Inc.
  EmEditor’s Update Checker automatically verifies the MSI signer and cancels the update if the signer is not Emurasoft, Inc.
  Alternatively, you can verify the SHA-256 hash values using the following:
