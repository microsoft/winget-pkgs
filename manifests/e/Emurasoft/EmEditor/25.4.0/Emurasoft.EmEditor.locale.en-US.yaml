ReleaseNotes: |-
  We’ve released EmEditor v25.4.0.
  This update focuses first and foremost on speed. We optimized numerous parts of the code so that many actions now run faster, especially on CPUs that support AVX‑512. I used the Chat with AI feature to help write the new optimizations; it felt like having another excellent engineer at my side.
  We also made classic, non‑AI optimizations. Find, Replace, Find in Files, and Replace in Files have been reworked to process UTF‑8 directly whenever possible, avoiding round trips to UTF‑16. Previously, Replace in Files on UTF‑8 converted to UTF‑16 and back; now replacements can happen directly on UTF‑8, eliminating conversion overhead. We also added a new Find in Files option: “Display File Names, Lines, and Matched Lines (truncate long lines),” enabled by default. Even when targets include very long lines (such as binaries), EmEditor now truncates output instead of printing entire lines for stable, responsive results. In our tests, Find, Replace, Find in Files, and Replace in Files were between about 2x and 6.5x faster.
  Stability has also improved. Find in Files runs multithreaded, but searching many huge files at once could use a lot of memory. We now limit the number of threads that open very large files to reduce memory usage. If memory allocation fails, EmEditor automatically falls back to a lower‑memory, single‑threaded mode and retries the operation, lowering the chance of a crash.
  After discontinuing the HTMLBar plug‑in in v25.3, some users missed the quick tag‑insertion buttons. In this release, you can define snippets directly in EmEditor and invoke them from menus, toolbars, or keyboard shortcuts. Execution is still handled by the Snippets plug‑in. To show the Snippets toolbar, go to View > Toolbars > Snippets. Create a snippet by dragging any text onto the Snippets toolbar, or define snippets via Customize > Snippets. For syntax details, see “To Use the Snippets Plug‑in” in the Help, or ask an AI for “EmEditor snippet syntax”.
  Chat with AI (by Makoto Emura) has also received upgrades:
  - New Web Search option for certain models (such as GPT‑5) to retrieve current information (for example, train timetables).
  - New Text Verbosity control to adjust response length.
  - Option to use environment variables (for example, OPENAI_API_KEY).
  - Backend optimizations for better performance.
  Note: To use AI features, including Chat with AI, install the ChatAI plug‑in separately.
  We also fixed issues found during the preview build.
  We hope both the Pro and Free editions meet your expectations. If you have questions, feature requests, or ideas, please contact us or post on the forum.
  We appreciate your continued support of EmEditor.
