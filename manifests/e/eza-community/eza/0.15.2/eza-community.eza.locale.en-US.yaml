ShortDescription: A modern, maintained replacement for ls, built on exa.
Description: "eza is a modern, maintained replacement for the venerable file-listing command-line program ls that ships with Unix and Linux operating systems, giving it more features and better defaults.\nIt uses colours to distinguish file types and metadata.\nIt knows about symlinks, extended attributes, and Git.\nAnd it\0s small, fast, and just one single binary."
