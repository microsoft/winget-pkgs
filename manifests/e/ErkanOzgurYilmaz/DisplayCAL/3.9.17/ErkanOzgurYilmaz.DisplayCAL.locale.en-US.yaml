ShortDescription: Display Calibration and Characterization powered by ArgyllCMS
Description: |-
  DisplayCAL (formerly known as dispcalGUI) is a display calibration and profiling solution with a focus on accuracy and versatility (in fact, the author is of the honest opinion it may be the most accurate and versatile ICC compatible display profiling solution available anywhere). At its core it relies on ArgyllCMS, an advanced open source color management system, to take measurements, create calibrations and profiles, and for a variety of other advanced color related tasks.
  Calibrate and characterize your display devices using one of many supported measurement instruments, with support for multi-display setups and a variety of available options for advanced users, such as verification and reporting functionality to evaluate ICC profiles and display devices, creating video 3D LUTs, as well as optional CIECAM02 gamut mapping to take into account varying viewing conditions. Other features include:
  - Support of colorimeter corrections for different display device types to increase the absolute accuracy of colorimeters. Corrections can be imported from vendor software or created from measurements if a spectrometer is available.
  - Check display device uniformity via measurements.
  - Test chart editor: Create charts with any amount and composition of color patches, easy copy & paste from CGATS, CSV files (only tab-delimited) and spreadsheet applications, for profile verification and evaluation.
  - Create synthetic ICC profiles with custom primaries, white- and blackpoint as well as tone response for use as working spaces or source profiles in device linking (3D LUT) transforms.

  This project intended to modernize the DisplayCAL code including Python 3 support.
  Florian Höch, the original developer, did an incredible job of creating and maintaining DisplayCAL for all these years. But, it seems that, during the pandemic, very understandably, he lost his passion to the project. Now, it is time for us, the DisplayCAL community, to contribute back to this great tool.
  This project is based on the HEAD of the Sourceforge version, which had 5 extra commits that Florian has created over the 3.8.9.3 release on 14 Jan 2020.
  Thanks to all the efforts put by the community DisplayCAL is now working with Python 3.9+.
