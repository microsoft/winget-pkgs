ShortDescription: Free and Open Source, Distributed, RESTful Search Engine
Description: Elasticsearch is an open source distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine, scalable data store, and vector database capable of addressing a growing number of use cases. As the heart of the Elastic Stack, it centrally stores your data for lightning-fast search, fine‑tuned relevancy, and powerful analytics that scale with ease.

  License changes

  Change to synthetic _source licensing
  Starting with this release, the synthetic _source feature is available exclusively with the Enterprise subscription. Synthetic _source is used in logs data streams (logsdb index mode), time series data streams (TSDS, using time_series index mode), application performance monitoring (APM), and Universal Profiling.
  If you are using these capabilities and are not on an Enterprise license, the change will result in increased storage requirements for new data, as the synthetic _source setting will be ignored. Existing indices that used synthetic _source will remain seamlessly accessible.
  Refer to the subscription page for Elastic Cloud and Elastic Stack/self-managed for the breakdown of available features and their associated subscription tiers. For further details and subscription options, contact your Elastic sales representative or contact us.
