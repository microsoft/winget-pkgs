ReleaseNotes: |-
  This release also includes: Deprecations.
  Features and enhancements
  All
  - Introduce cloud connectors flow. #47587
  - Make beats receivers emit status for their subcomponents. #48015
  - Add GUID translation, base DN inference, and SSPI authentication to LDAP processor. #47827
  - Add events.failure_store metric to track events sent to Elasticsearch failure store. #48068 #47164
  Filebeat
  - Add support for direct HTTP request rate limit setting in CEL input. #46953
  - Allow adding file owner and group to the events' meta fields on Unix systems. #47331 #43226
  - Add AWS auth method for CEL and HTTP JSON inputs. #47260
  - Add client secret authentication method for Azure Event Hub and storage in Filebeat. #47256
  - Add client address and name to submitted Redis slowlogs. #41507
  - Log unpublished event count and exit publish loop on input context cancellation. #47730
  - Upgrade CEL mito library version to v1.24.0. #47762
  - Add OTEL metrics to CEL inputs. #47014
  - Improve input error reporting to Elastic Agent, specially when pipeline configurations are incorrect. #47905 #45649
  - Azure EventHub input v2 - Add support for AMQP over WebSocket and HTTPS proxy. #47956 #47823
  - The Journald input now supports setting a chroot to use when calling the journalctl binary, thus allowing the journald input to be used with the wolfi container variant and in environments where the host's Journald is not compatible with the journalctl version shipped with the container. . #48008 #47164
    Add support in the journald inpur for using chroot when calling journalctl. In a container environment this allows to mount the host file system into the container and use its journalctl, which prevents any sort of incompatibility between the journalctl in the container image and the host Journald. Allows using the journald input with Wolfi based Docker containers.
  - GZIP support is GA and always enabled on filestream. #47893 #47880
    Ingesting GZIP-compressed files is now GA. The gzip_experimental configuration option has been deprecated. Users should use compression instead. Refer to the documentation for more details.
  - Filebeat deploy on kubernetes examples use compression instead of gzip_experimental. #48079 #47882
  - Add file-based auth provider for CEL and HTTP JSON inputs. #47507 #47506
    The CEL and HTTP JSON inputs now support reading authentication tokens from files, enabling integration with various secret providers like Vault, Kubernetes secret projections, etc. Tokens are automatically refreshed based on a configurable interval without requiring restarts.
  Metricbeat
  - Change calculation of CPU/Memory for Kubernetes to allocatable values. #47815
    Update kubernetes cpu and memory metrics to use allocatable values instead of capacity values.
  - Add extra debug logging to simplify troubleshooting in prometheus module. #47477 #15693
  - Add resource pool id to vsphere cluster metricset. #47883
  - Add last_terminated_exitcode to kubernetes.container.status. #47968
  - Report memory pressure stall information (PSI) for cgroup v2. #48054
    Add memory PSI metrics to system.process.cgroup, complementing existing CPU and IO pressure metrics for cgroupv2.
  Osquerybeat
