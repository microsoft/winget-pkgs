ShortDescription: Winlogbeat, the open source tool for shipping Windows event logs to Elasticsearch to get insight into your system, application, and security information.
Description: |-
  The Beats are lightweight data shippers, written in Go, that you install on your servers to capture all sorts of operational data (think of logs, metrics, or network packet data).
  The Beats send the operational data to Elasticsearch, either directly or via Logstash, so it can be visualized with Kibana.
  By "lightweight", we mean that Beats have a small installation footprint, use limited system resources, and have no runtime dependencies.
