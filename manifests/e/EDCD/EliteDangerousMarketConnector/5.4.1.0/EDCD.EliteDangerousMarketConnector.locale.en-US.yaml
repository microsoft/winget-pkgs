ReleaseNotes: |
  Release 5.4.1
  - We now test against, and package with, Python 3.10.5.
  - If for any reason EDMarketConnector.exe fails to shutdown and exit when asked to by the upgrade process this should no longer result in a spontaneous system reboot. Closes #1492.
    A manual reboot will still be required to complete the EDMarketConnector upgrade process and we make no guarantees about the stability of the application until this is done.
  - The new EDDN fsssignaldiscovered/1 schema has been implemented.
  - EDSM trace level logging will no longer log API credentials unless explicitly asked to, separately from other EDSM API trace logging.
  Bug Fixes
  - EDDN: Ensure we always remove all _Localised suffix keys in data. This was missed in some recent new schemas and turned out to be an issue for at least approachsettlement/1.
