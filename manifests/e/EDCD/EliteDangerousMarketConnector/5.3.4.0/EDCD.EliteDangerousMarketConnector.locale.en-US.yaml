ReleaseNotes: |-
  Whilst EDMarketConnector.exe was fixed for the Odyssey Update 11 difference in Journal file names, EDMC.exe was not. If you're wondering, that's the command-line utility that, for instance, Trade Computer Extensions uses to obtain data.
  • Use the new common function for finding latest journal file in EDMC.py.
  • Quietens some NavRoute related logging for the benefit of EDMC.py. This is now at DEBUG level, rather than INFO.
