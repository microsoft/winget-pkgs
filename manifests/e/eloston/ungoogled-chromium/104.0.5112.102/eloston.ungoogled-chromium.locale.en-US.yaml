ShortDescription: ungoogled-chromium is Google Chromium without dependency on Google web services.
Description: |-
  ungoogled-chromium is a set of configuration flags, patches, and custom scripts.

  These components altogether strive to accomplish the following
  * Disable or remove offending services and features that communicate with Google or weaken privacy
  * Strip binaries from the source tree, and use those provided by the system or build them from source
  * Add, modify, or disable features that inhibit control and transparency (these changes are minor and do not have significant impacts on the general user experience)

  ungoogled-chromium should not be considered a fork of Chromium.
  The main reason for this is that a fork is associated with more significant deviations from the Chromium, such as branding, configuration formats, file locations, and other interface changes.
  ungoogled-chromium will not modify the Chromium browser outside of the project's goals.
  Since these goals and requirements are not precise, unclear situations are discussed and decided on a case-by-case basis.
