InstallationNotes: |-
  • Though the program does not ask on its own for admin rights, users must run it with admin rights, or else the emulator will very likely (but is not guaranteed to) silently crash on launch.
  • When installed through Winget, the installed program has different config folders based on whether it is run through PATH or from its folder. The seemingly easiest way to sync the two launch methods, is to:
    1) Launch from PATH in PowerShell with "eka2l1_qt", which generates a folder in %ProgramFiles%\WinGet\Packages\EKA2L1.EKA2L1__DefaultSource\data
    2) Close EKA2L1.
    3) Launch EKA2L1 from a folder, and get to "Settings" → "General" → "Emulator data path" → "Browse", and then select that same (...)\WinGet\Packages\EKA2L1.EKA2L1__DefaultSource\data
  In order to run N-Gage games in EKA2L1：
  • Ensure the device's ROM firmware is in fact N-Gage. If not, then both the "Mount game card image" and "Install → N-Gage Game Card" options will be greyed out.
  • When using "Install → N-Gage Came Card", ensure that the selected folder is unzipped and has a "system" subfolder immediately inside it, or the error "Can't find the game data folder!" is shown.
  • When using "Mount game card image", ensure that the selected folder is unzipped and has a "system" subfolder immediately inside it, or the game won't show up in EKA2L1's app drawer.
  • Occasionally, an app can crash soon after launch for no easily apparently reason, with the CMD errors implying missing scripts/files/folders. Installing a 2nd and non-"N-Gage" device can possibly make the app successfully launch in the 1st N-Gage device.
