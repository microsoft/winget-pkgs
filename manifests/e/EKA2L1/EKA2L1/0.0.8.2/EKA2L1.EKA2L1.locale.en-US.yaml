InstallationNotes: |-
  • Though the program does not ask on its own for admin rights, users must run it with admin rights, or else the emulator will very likely (but is not guaranteed to) silently crash on launch.
  In order to run N-Gage games in EKA2L1:
  • Ensure the device's RPKG is in fact N-Gage. If not, then both the "Mount game card image" and "Install → N-Gage Game Card" options will be greyed out.
  • When using "Install → N-Gage Came Card", ensure that the selected folder is unzipped and has a "system" subfolder immediately inside it, or the error "Can't find the game data folder!" is shown.
  • When using "Mount game card image", ensure that the selected folder is unzipped and has a "system" subfolder immediately inside it, or the game won't show up in EKA2L1's app drawer.
