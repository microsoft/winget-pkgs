ReleaseNotes: |-
  We are pleased to announce the first maintenance release for EdgeTX "Jolly Mon", v2.11.1. Thank you for all the feedback and testing by you, the community (and partner manufacturers) which has allowed us to identify and squash both new and old bugs!! We simply cannot have done this without you! ü§ó üçª
  Note
  - As with any firmware update, please ensure you back up your model and radio settings before updating, fully bench-test your models after updating, and report any issues you encounter.
  - For MacOS users, Companion is now only compiled for MacOS 13 and above. Stay with v2.10.5 or earlier if you need support for an older version of MacOS.
  - EdgeTX Companion v2.11 can no longer do binary conversions, and thus cannot open .otx files. If you have an old .otx file you need to convert or open, you will need to use an older version of EdgeTX Companion. This follows on from EdgeTX 2.8 being the last firmware version to support binary conversion (i.e. from OpenTX 2.3 or earlier versions of EdgeTX).
  Warning
  Due to a change in how the handset battery voltage calculation is done (due to #5635, #6255), you may want to double check the accuracy of your measured handset battery voltage if you have calibrated it in the past. Default value should be pretty close if you have never calibrated it.

  Full Changelog: v2.11.0...v2.11.1
  Known Limitations and Issues
  - Wireless Model Trainer and CRSF/ELRS - if using the Multi Protocol Module (MPM) as a wireless trainer in conjunction with CRSF/ELRS, do not go above 250 Hz, otherwise the MPM wireless trainer will be dropped. 250 Hz or below is stable.
  - Due to a change in how the battery voltage calculation is done, you may want to double check the accuracy of your measured battery voltage if you have calibrated it in the past. #5635, #6255
  UI/UX behavioural changes and/or new capabilities:
  - Color LCD: menus now "wrap around" when using the rotary encoder, allowing you to get to back to the top of the list quickly (#4867)
  - Companion: New menus have been added, and menu entries reorganized to be no so cluttered and more logical (#5753)
  - Companion: Now automatically validates if any model settings have any missing mixer or input sources, and prevents writing of invalid model configurations to handset, while turning invalid model names red. Shows a red/green traffic light at the bottom of the models window to indicate overall status (#5798)
  Supported radios

  Language and Custom builds
  Custom prebuilt firmware is no longer available. However, the CloudBuild option in EdgeTX is here to allow you to build your own firmware, with just a few clicks. Additionally, EdgeTX Companion now also has some support for CloudBuild, and will automatically fetch firmware for a supported language when you use the "Update components" option. But you can still build your own firmware online following this guide, request a specific build at #6165 or ask on Discord for someone to build one for you.
