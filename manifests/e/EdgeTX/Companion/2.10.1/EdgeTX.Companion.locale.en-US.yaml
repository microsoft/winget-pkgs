ReleaseNotes: |-
  We are pleased to offer the first maintenance release for EdgeTX "Centurion", v2.10.1. As with any firmware update, please ensure you backup your settings before updating, check your model and radio settings, and do appropriate bench tests before you head out to fly.
  [!TIP]
  The Multi-Protocol Module (MPM) firmware has recently been split into up to four different firmware "types" - air, surface, LBT and FCC - as there isn't enough space for all protocols in the one firmware. So if you are missing protocols and have recently updated your MPM firmware, ensure you are running the correct type for your region and needs by downloading it again from https://downloads.multi-module.org/ and choosing the firmware type you need.
  [!NOTE]
  If you are using 3rd party Lua scripts (e.g. Yaapu, iNav), please ensure you are using the latest version of these also, as we have had some reports of older versions triggering the firmware to crash and go into Emergency Mode with some setups.
  [!NOTE]
  Reminder: Upgrading from versions of EdgeTX earlier than v2.6 (or from OpenTX) is no longer possible via the radio firmware. You first need to update to EdgeTX 2.8 in order to migrate your radio and model settings, and then you can update to the current version.  See the Installing and Updating EdgeTX manual page for more information.
  What's Changed
  Radio
  - fix: issues with some translations preventing some translated firmware from being built by @pfeerick in #4993

  - fix(bw): incorrect navigation in advanced USB setup on X9 radios by @philmoz in #5082
  - fix(bw212): wrong source string being displayed by @3djc in #5002
  - fix(x9e): missing F3/F4 pots, slider hwdef changes by @3djc in #5012
  - fix(T12): SH switch not being displayed on main view by @3djc in #5040
  - fix(color): selected label, model list not correctly updating in single select mode by @philmoz in #5048
  - fix(color): adjust layout of model labels "AND" text to reduce text overlap by @philmoz in #5081
  Companion

  - fix: set input and switch types to none if not configured rather than keep reloading defaults by @elecpower in #5026
  - fix: add missing t20v2 simulator, hwdefs by @pfeerick in #5058
  - fix: incorrect initialisation of switch warning state if all switch warnings turned off (#5063)
  - fix: some GFs would lose parameters if radio had old model files present by @elecpower in #5072
  - fix: validate translated update component name when used for folder name by @elecpower in #5079
  New Radio
  - feat: Jumper T15 support by @3djc in  #5061
  Full Changelog: https://github.com/EdgeTX/edgetx/compare/v2.10.0...v2.10.1More information, which is broken down into by screen type (Color LCD and B&W), is available in the user manual here. You can also check the 2.10.0 release notes for what was new or changed in this release.Known Limitations and Issues
  - Wireless Model Trainer and CRSF/ELRS - if using the Multi Protocol Module (MPM) as a wireless trainer in conjunction with CRSF/ELRS, do not go above 250 Hz, otherwise the MPM wireless trainer will be dropped. 250 Hz or below is stable.
  - There is no companion support for RadioMaster MT12 (yet!)
  - If you are using Flysky digital hall gimbals, they will need to be re-calibrated, if they were calibrated previously with previous versions of EdgeTX (due to #3778).
  - When updating, the following special and/or global functions may need to be re-enabled: Instant Trim, BG Music Pause, Vario, Screenshot, Racing Mode, Disable Touch, and Audio Amp Off. cf. #4498
  - If you find you have missing analog inputs (e.g. S1/S2), please check if they are still enabled/configured on the Radio Settings -> Hardware -> Pots page/section. They will not appear on the calibration screen if they are not configured.
  - If you are an iFlight Commando8 user - DO NOT update to this release. Please wait until #4798 is resolved.
  - If you are a Jumper T20 user and were running pre 2.10.0 firmware, you should redo your battery calibration if you want accurate readings. Where to find the settting.
  - If you are a Radiomaster MT12 user and were running pre 2.10.0 firmware, please double check your trims as they have been swapped to match the labelling on the transmitter.
  - For Companion, the sound pack update filter needs to be changed in order to see all the available language packs for your language... see #3848 for instructions.
  - For Companion, both radio and firmware now take into account the form factor of the module bay when showing list of external RF modules. If the list is not correct for you, double check that the right module bay type is set in the radio profile settings. cf. #3628
  UI/UX behavioral changes and/or new capabilities:
  - colorlcd: In addition to the long/short press actions added in 2.9 for MDL and SYS,  the TELE key now has a long press action, which takes you to the Channel Monitor. A short pess takes you to Screen Settings like with previous versions.
  - colorlcd: You can also press MDL, SYS and TELE while in the first level of the menus to switch to another menu entirely... i.e. you can switch from any of the Model Settings tabs to Radio Settings simply by pressing the SYS button. Or bring up the channel monitor while in any of the Radio Settings or Model Settings screens by pressing the TELE button.
  - companion: Companion will now ensure that model names of existing models (and labels, if supported) only have characters that can be entered on the radio. If invalid characters are detected, they will be removed from the name. Companion will also not accept invalid characters as input.

  https://buddy.edgetx.org/#/flash?version=v2.10.1Unofficial builds
  Pre-built language firmwares are available here, but this will be the last version to offer them this way, due to the availability of CloudBuild on EdgeTX Buddy. You can still build your own firmware online following this guide, request a specific build at #4992 or ask on Discord for someone to build one for you.New Contributors
