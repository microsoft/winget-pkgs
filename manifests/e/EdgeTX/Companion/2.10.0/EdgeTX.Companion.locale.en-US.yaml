ReleaseNotes: |-
  With great thanks to everyone involved in testing, reporting and fixing bugs, we are pleased to offer EdgeTX "Centurion" v2.10.0. As with any firmware update, please ensure you backup your settings before updating, check your model and radio settings, and do appropriate bench tests before you head out to fly.[!TIP]
  The Multi-Protocol Module (MPM) firmware has recently been split into up to four different firmware "types" - air, surface, LBT and FCC - as there isn't enough space for all protocols in the one firmware. So if you are missing protocols and have recently updated your MPM firmware, ensure you are running the correct type for your region and needs by downloading it again from https://downloads.multi-module.org/ and choosing the firmware type you need.
  [!NOTE]
  If you are using 3rd party Lua scripts (e.g. Yappu, iNav), please ensure you are using the latest version of these also, as we have had some reports of older versions triggering the firmware to crash and go into Emergency Mode with some setups.
  [!NOTE]
  Reminder: Upgrading from versions of EdgeTX earlier than v2.6 (or from OpenTX) is no longer possible via the radio firmware. You first need to update to EdgeTX 2.8 in order to migrate your radio and model settings, and then you can update to the current version.  See the Installing and Updating EdgeTX manual page for more information.
  Cloud Build
  We would like to formally announce the existence of CloudBuild on EdgeTX Buddy, which some eagle eyed users have spotted and been using already. In addition to flashing the normal release builds (Cloud) or firmware you've built yourself or gotten from someone else (Local file), there is now also the "CloudBuild" option on Buddy. Via this tab, you can pick from an available firmware version, pick your radio type, and then choose from a limited (for now) range of build options. For colorlcd radios, this is primarily just the language for the radio firmware. For black and white radios, you have a few more choices, including the ability to remove heli and set the font type.If you want a language build, or to customise the build options that are currently exposed, please give it a try, and let us know if you have any issues, and also help us find out what additional options people want access to. While some options have been limited to supported radio types, please note that it is still possible to pick some invalid options - such as a translation language that did not exist in older firmware versions, so please keep that in mind when making choices.Highlights of this release include:
  - New "Eddie the Edgehog" default splash screen - on color display radios also shows the current version of EdgeTX installed
  - On colorlcd, a custom image can be shown on shutdown instead of shutdown animation
  - On colorlcd, interacting with labels on the manage models screen has been reworked - you can now choose to have only one label active at a time, or multiple labels
  - On colorlcd, you can pick from three more views for how models will be shown, including smaller icons and list views.
  - On colorlcd, the sources list picker and filters have been reworked
  - On colorlcd, the splash screen delay can now be changed
  - All special and global functions can be enabled or disabled - no need to delete them if you no longer want certain ones temporarily inactive
  - Unused trim switches can be used as 3POS switches
  - "Telemetry Connected" will be played when the connection is first established
  - Pre-flight checklists now have an "interactive" option, whereby you can tick off each item in turn
  - PPM units can be changed at runtime, rather than being a compile time option
  - RGB LED control/animations on supported radios (e.g. MT12, PL18, PL18EV)
  - Startup sound can be disabled (there is now an option, rather than needing to delete hello.wav)
  - Analog inputs, such as pots and sliders can now be configured as a Switch, Axis X or Axis Y. Additionally, they can also be configured to be inverted
  More information, which is broken down into by screen type (Color LCD and B&W), is available in the user manual here.Full Changelog: https://github.com/EdgeTX/edgetx/compare/v2.9.4...v2.10.0Known Limitations and Issues
  - Wireless Model Trainer and CRSF/ELRS - if using the Multi Protocol Module (MPM) as a wireless trainer in conjunction with CRSF/ELRS, do not go above 250 Hz, otherwise the MPM wireless trainer will be dropped. 250 Hz or below is stable.
  - There is no companion support for RadioMaster MT12 (yet!)
  - If you are using Flysky digital hall gimbals, they will need to be re-calibrated, if they were calibrated previously with previous versions of EdgeTX (due to #3778).
  - When updating, the following special and/or global functions may need to be re-enabled: Instant Trim, BG Music Pause, Vario, Screenshot, Racing Mode, Disable Touch, and Audio Amp Off. cf. #4498
  - If you are an iFlight Commando8 user - DO NOT update to this release. Please wait until #4798 is resolved.
  - If you are a Jumper T20 user, you should redo your battery calibration if you want accurate readings. Where to find the settting
  - If you are a Radiomaster MT12 user, please double check your trims as they have been swapped to match the labelling on the transmitter
  - For Companion, the sound pack update filter needs to be changed in order to see all the available language packs for your language... see #3848 for instructions.
  - For Companion, both radio and firmware now take into account the form factor of the module bay when showing list of external RF modules. If the list is not correct for you, double check that the right module bay type is set in the radio profile settings. cf. #3628
  UI/UX behavioral changes and/or new capabilities:
  - colorlcd: In addition to the long/short press actions added in 2.9 for MDL and SYS,  the TELE key now has a long press action, which takes you to the Channel Monitor. A short pess takes you to Screen Settings like with previous versions.
  - colorlcd: You can also press MDL, SYS and TELE while in the first level of the menus to switch to another menu entirely... i.e. you can switch from any of the Model Settings tabs to Radio Settings simply by pressing the SYS button. Or bring up the channel monitor while in any of the Radio Settings or Model Settings screens by pressing the TELE button.
  - companion: Companion will now ensure that model names of existing models (and labels, if supported) only have characters that can be entered on the radio. If invalid characters are detected, they will be removed from the name. Companion will also not accept invalid characters as input.

  https://buddy.edgetx.org/#/flash?version=v2.10.0Unofficial builds
  Pre-built language firmwares will be available soon. In the meantime, why don't you give the CloudBuild option on EdgeTX Buddy a try? You can still build your own firmware online following this guide, request a specific build at #4992 or ask on Discord for someone to build one for you.New Contributors
