ReleaseNotes: |-
  Miscellaneous
  Added two misc options to allow the View Logs feature and/or Custom Triggers to receive the original log line instead of one modified by plugins or having the timestamp removed. -- The Custom Triggers tab & Spell Timers page will try to remember node expansion when rebuilding the list. When removing a Custom Trigger/Spell Timer(Alt-R), it will try to select an adjacent node. -- For some Linux users, their version of the CLR gets confused by an app.config section which prevents web requests from completing. If ACT detects this, it will create a notification with an option to modify the app.config to remove this offending config section. -- Some instances of \n have been replaced with Environment.NewLine in text generation.
  Miscellaneous UI / API
  ButtonPainted and CheckboxButtonPainted margin/padding logic now more closely matches their WinForms counterparts. Slightly altered some of the color blending methods these types of controls use.
  Plugins / API
  Exposed Color.ToAdjustedColor() extension method to alter a given color according to ACT's UI settings or other arbitrary values. Exposed Color.MixWith() extension method to mix one color with another by a percentage. -- Fixed some cases where ACT's custom controls would not work in designer mode without a parented form(like when designing a UserControl). -- LogLineEventArgs.originalLogLine will now have the same value in OnLogLineRead as it did in BeforeLogLineRead. -- TraySliderAdd() should properly run on the UI thread like the docs state.
