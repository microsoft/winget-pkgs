ReleaseNotes: |-
  Miscellaneous
  Custom Trigger & Spell Timer fields should remain more static when automatically saving config once per minute or possibly changing zones. If a download takes more than 30 seconds, a TraySlider will periodically appear with the percentage progress. If a plugin is missing on startup, a TraySlider message will be shown.
  Plugin/API
  Added another overload for UncachedFileSave(). TraySliders will try to disable/dismiss immediately instead of only when all event handlers have returned. Download requests will be internally threaded regardless of how the method is called but will otherwise act the same.
