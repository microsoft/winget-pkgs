ReleaseNotes: |-
  Downloads
  Added a workaround for 409 download errors for affected users of certain VPNs or ISPs. If you are affected and cannot temporarily use a different internet connection for ACT, use the setup from GitHub to update ACT.
  Theming/Colors
  Fixed the search bar in the Options tab to properly apply font coloring to matching settings. -- Fixed a bug that would fail to apply some settings for dark theme presets when the user was in a locale where commas and decimal points are swapped. This only affects Luminance Offset and Saturation Offset when the preset buttons are pressed.
  Miscellaneous
  Fresh install defaults use FFXIV-centric settings; the Startup Wizard will always/still apply game appropriate settings when directed. Fixed a possible crash when the config is missing and ACT attempts to direct the user to use config backups. Added some debug info for the window out of bounds warning.
