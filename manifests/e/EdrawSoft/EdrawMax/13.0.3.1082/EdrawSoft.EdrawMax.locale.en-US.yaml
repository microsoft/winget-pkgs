ReleaseNotes: |-
  Optimization of Graphic Operations

  We now support setting the size of multiple shapes all at once. For example, you can select an entire flowchart, go to the Size button, input the width and height values, and all the shape sizes in the flowchart will be modified.

  When you set No Fill to a shape, the hollow part will not be selectable or draggable. This will make it easier for you to select the shapes underneath the No Fill shape.

  Optimization of Text Operations:

  We have added the Autofit mode for text boxes. You can enable this mode from the drop-down menu under the Text tool.

  We have improved the clarity of formulas inserted on the canvas using the formula tool. Also, you are now allowed to change the formulas size while editing.

  Now you have the option to show or hide the dimensions of individual objects in a floor plan.

  Other Improvements:

  Exporting images and PDFs now supports the option to display or remove gridlines.

  We have optimized the issue where the connecting line arrow could not be reversed in certain scenes.
