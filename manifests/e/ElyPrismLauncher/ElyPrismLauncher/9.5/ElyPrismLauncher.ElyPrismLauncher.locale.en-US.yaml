ReleaseNotes: |-
  This release is based on Prism Launcher 9.4
  Fixes
  - Ely.by Authlibs are now stored separately from Mojang Authlibs. This fixes an issue where it was impossible to use a Mojang Authlib after a Ely.by Authlib has already been downloaded. If you encountered this issue, delete your libraries folder.
    - This also reduces launch time and network bandwidth spent
  - Fixed a possible bug where the game would attempt loading authlib-injector even if the launcher was unable to fetch authlib-injector
  - Fixed an issue that caused the launcher to fetch authlib-injector even when Ely.by patching wasn't wanted
