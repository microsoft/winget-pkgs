ReleaseNotes: |-
  See PrismLauncher changelogs:
  9.0
  9.1
  New features in ElyPrismLauncher
  - Modern and secure login: ElyPrismLauncher now uses OAuth2 to log you in. This means that your credentials are never transferred to the launcher. Instead, you log into your account on the official Ely.by page in the browser, and Ely.by gives the launcher a token to access your account with limited privileges.
  - Skins support on servers: ElyPrismLauncher now uses Ely.by's official Authlib patches, allowing you to see skins anywhere
  Important notes
  - ElyPrismLauncher now has it's own branding (thanks @mctaylors!)
  - Due to changes in the account list format made in Prism Launcher 9.1, you will have to re-add your Ely.by accounts
  - ElyPrismLauncher now uses it's own data directory, separate from Prism Launcher. You will be offered an option to migrate data on first startup.
