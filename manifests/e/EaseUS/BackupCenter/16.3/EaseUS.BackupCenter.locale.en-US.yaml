ShortDescription: Your streamlined central backup management console.
Description: |-
  EaseUS Backup Center – the centralized backup management solution helps to deploy backup tasks to multiple terminal machines from one console, run and monitor backups on all systems easily.

  EaseUS Backup Center is a web-based portal working with EaseUS Todo Backup Enterprise, which enables IT administrators, and service providers to deliver the centralized management of the backup tasks to the client PCs.

  EaseUS Backup Center needs to be installed on one of your machines as the server-side. Next, all the management is available through a web application called the Management Portal. 

  The management portal enables administrators to:
    1. Add client PCs to the portal.
    2. Manage and Group the client PCs.
    3. Create multiple backup tasks with the intelligent backup scheme and cleanup strategy.
    4. Remotely deploy and manage backup tasks to different clients/group
    5. Monitor the backup tasks on the Client PCs.
