ShortDescription: A modern and open IDE for cloud and desktop.
Description: |-
  The Eclipse IDE is a modern and open IDE for cloud and desktop. The Theia IDE is based on the Theia platform. The Theia IDE is available as a downloadable desktop application. You can also try the latest version of the Theia IDE online. The online test version is limited to 30 minutes per session and hosted via Theia.cloud. Finally, we provide an experimental Docker image for hosting the Theia IDE online.
  The Eclipse Theia IDE also serves as a template for building desktop-based products based on the Eclipse Theia platform, as well as to showcase Eclipse Theia capabilities. It is made up of a subset of existing Eclipse Theia features and extensions. Documentation is available to help you customize and build your own Eclipse Theia-based product.

  Breaking Changes:
  - [monaco] refactored some of the fields in MonacoEditor and MonacoDiffEditor as part of #16832:
    - changed the type of MonacoEditor.savedViewState from monaco.editor.ICodeEditorViewState | null to monaco.editor.IEditorViewState | null and also changed its visibility from public to protected
    - removed protected field MonacoEditor.model
    - removed protected fields savedDiffState, originalTextModel, and modifiedTextModel in MonacoDiffEditor
  - [preferences] Removed the optional 'knownCurrentValue' argument to PreferenceLeadNodeRenderer#updateModificationStatus. Renamed isModifiedInScope to isSet to reflect new semantics. #16836
  - [core] removed oldValue and newValue fields from the PreferenceChange and the PreferenceProxy's PreferenceChangeEvent interfaces. The newValue field was a common footgun, as it represented the value in the changed scope rather than the effective value. In particular, it could be undefined when a given scope was cleared even if another scope provided a defined value. Use PreferenceService.get or PreferenceProxy.get or indexing on a PreferenceProxy to retrieve the active value rather than using the newValue field. #16832
  - [scm] refactored some of the methods pertaining to the 3-way Merge Editor implementation as part of #16867
    - removed the MergeEditorModel.findMergeRanges method
    - renamed the RangeUtils.isBeforeOrTouching method to isBefore
  - [ai-chat, ai-core] refactored tool handler context types #16899: Tool handlers now receive ToolInvocationContext (with cancellationToken) instead of MutableChatRequestModel. Chat-bound tools should use assertChatContext(ctx) to access ChatToolContext with request and response properties.
  - [ai-chat] fixed: refactor tool handler context types for type safety #16901
  - [ai-terminal] added shellExecutionTool for AI agents #16878
  - [core] passed widget consistently to toolbar enablement handlers #16826
