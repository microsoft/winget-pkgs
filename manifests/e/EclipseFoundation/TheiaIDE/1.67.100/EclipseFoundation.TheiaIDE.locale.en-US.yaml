ShortDescription: A modern and open IDE for cloud and desktop.
Description: |-
  The Eclipse IDE is a modern and open IDE for cloud and desktop. The Theia IDE is based on the Theia platform. The Theia IDE is available as a downloadable desktop application. You can also try the latest version of the Theia IDE online. The online test version is limited to 30 minutes per session and hosted via Theia.cloud. Finally, we provide an experimental Docker image for hosting the Theia IDE online.
  The Eclipse Theia IDE also serves as a template for building desktop-based products based on the Eclipse Theia platform, as well as to showcase Eclipse Theia capabilities. It is made up of a subset of existing Eclipse Theia features and extensions. Documentation is available to help you customize and build your own Eclipse Theia-based product.

  Breaking Changes:
  - [ai-core] objects returned by AiSettingsService settings retrievals marked readonly. To mutate a settings object, make a copy. #16612
  - [core] CommonCommands has been extracted from common-frontend-contribution.ts into its own file common-commands.ts. This only affects code using deep imports: imports of CommonCommands from @theia/core/lib/browser/common-frontend-contribution should be updated to use the standard barrel export @theia/core/lib/browser instead.
  - [core] CommonMenus has been extracted from common-frontend-contribution.ts into its own file common-menus.ts. This only affects code using deep imports: imports of CommonMenus from @theia/core/lib/browser/common-frontend-contribution should be updated to use the standard barrel export @theia/core/lib/browser instead.
  - [core] moved CommonCommands to separate file #16522
  - [debug] DebugSessionManager.getFunctionBreakpoints(), DebugSessionManager.getInstructionBreakpoints(), and DebugSessionManager.getBreakpoints() no longer default to the current session when called without arguments. Callers that relied on the implicit default to currentSession must now pass this.currentSession explicitly. #16537
  - [debug] refactored some of the debug model elements as part of #16689:
    - added required id parameter to DebugStackFrame and DebugScope constructors
    - changed type of keys in the DebugThread._frames map from number to string
    - added required startFrame parameter to DebugThread.doUpdateFrames method
  - [debug] some of the fields and methods of DebugToolBar have been removed in #16719
  - [debug] moved Debug*Commands and DebugMenus to separate file #16700
  - [plugin-ext] $setBadge method removed from WebviewsMain interface and WebviewsMainImpl; badge-related fields removed from WebviewView interface and implementation; badge-related fields removed from PluginViewWidget; badge-related fields removed from WebviewWidget. Use the BadgeService instead of BadgeWidget interface implementation to show extension badges. #16518
  - [scm] ScmTabBarDecorator and bindings removed. ScmWidget now contributes badge decorations via the BadgeService. #16518
