  What‚Äôs new in Wave Link 1.10.1?
  This version adds support for the latest addition to our Wave family, plus a handful of changes and bug fixes. Let‚Äôs take a closer look together.

  üéôÔ∏è Meet Wave Neo
  When it‚Äôs time to meet or record, grab hold of Wave Neo. Standing at the perfect height, it captures your voice with all the clarity of a premium microphone. It‚Äôs also really simple to use‚Äîso you can plug in, unmute with confidence, and have more fun.
  Sounding pro has never been this easy:
  - Sound pro: Eliminate distortion commonly caused by built-in mics
  - Plug ‚Äòn play: It‚Äôs ready out of the box, no software setup needed
  - Ultra versatile: Works with laptops, iPads, PS5, and even iPhones*
  - Sleek design: Looks great in your setup and saves desk space
  - High-rise stand: Enhances vocals and quiets noisy keyboards
  - Tap to mute: Its LED glows red when muted‚Äîtap again to unmute
  - Foam filter: Smooths out your sound, available in five colors
  - Headphone jack: Plug in with ease and listen with zero delay
  - Wave Link: Includes optional app to mix audio and add effects
  - Stream Deck: Adjust volume or toggle effects with a key press
  - Neo for nature: Made and packaged with less plastic waste *Requires Lightning-to-USB adaptor

  ‚ôªÔ∏è Device fallback
  Now you can set a fallback Monitor Mix output, for when your primary device becomes unavailable. For example, you can automatically switch to your speakers when headphones are unplugged.
  To turn on device fallback, open your Wave Link preferences.

  üõ†Ô∏è Bug fixes and performance improvements
  - The update window no longer appears over other apps‚Äîand can be dismissed with a click
  - The tray icon is now more accessible, appearing in black when Windows is set to light mode
