  What’s new in Wave Link 2.0?
  We’re excited to introduce Wave Link 2.0 - Discover powerful new features like Voice Focus (which gives you studio-grade sound in seconds), one-click audio routing, easy mic sound checks, and streamlined Stream Deck control—making your audio setup smoother and smarter than ever.

  🪄 Voice Focus, powered by ai|coustics
  Using artificial intelligence, Voice Focus gives your microphone studio-grade quality. Not only does it remove unwanted background noise, it also addresses reverb which can give the impression of being in a fully sound-treated studio environment.
  We’ve partnered with ai|coustics, on which Voice Focus is built. Thanks to an incredibly efficient model, Voice Focus can run on nearly any system and CPU.
  🔊 Unmute the video and hear the difference

  Voice Focus is compatible with the following products:
  - Elgato Wave:1, Wave:3, and Wave Neo microphones
  - Elgato Wave XLR and XLR Dock for Stream Deck +
  3rd party microphones added to Wave Link and capture cards do not support Voice Focus.

  🆕 One-Click Audio Routing
  Routing audio into Wave Link has been entirely overhauled. Select the channel to which you want to add sound, then select the program. Yep, it's that simple*. No more complicated Windows audio settings.
  *Some apps require additional configuration.

  🆕 Sound Check
  Record a short clip of audio, then play it back repeatedly while toggling audio effects on and off to hear how your sound changes.
  Sound Check is compatible with the following products:
  - Elgato Wave:1, Wave:3, and Wave Neo microphones
  - Elgato Wave XLR and XLR Dock for Stream Deck +
  *3rd party microphones added to Wave Link and capture cards do not support Sound Check.

  🆕 Microphone Mute Button
  When using a Wave device you’ll find a new mute button. Click it and your Mic is muted. This engages the hardware mute, as if you had tapped on your Wave mic’s capacitive mute button.

  🆕 Send to Stream Deck
  Setting up your Stream Deck to control Wave Link has just been massively simplified. Click on the Send to Stream Deck button and a custom profile based on your Wave Link configuration and connected Stream Deck device is automatically created for you.
  Don’t have the Wave Link plugin for Stream Deck? Get it from Marketplace.

  🆕 One-tap app routing with Stream Deck
  With the updated Wave Link plugin, you can configure an action to route whichever app is in the foreground to the selected Wave Link channel.

  🪟 Foreground app control with Stream Deck
  With the updated Wave Link plugin, a key or dial can be set to always control the input channel that the foreground app is routed through. For example, if Google Chrome is assigned to the browser channel, and Chrome is in the foreground, the key or dial will control the browser input. If Spotify is selected, which routes to the Music channel, the same key or dial will automatically switch and now control the music channel.
  Find the foreground app control option in the Wave Link plugin’s Input action

  🆕 App grouping
  With app grouping, multiple apps can be routed to the same input channel

  🆕 Input channel renaming
  While you could rename audio channels previously, now these names change the virtual device names in Windows. This makes it even easier to use Wave Link virtual channels in other applications.

  🆕 Hide unused channels
  Unused channels in Wave Link are now disabled in your system outputs, reducing clutter and making your setup even more organized.

  🎨 Visual touchups
  We’ve touched up many areas of Wave Link in subtle ways, making it even more pretty.

  🔌 Reduce sibilance with Elgato DeEsser
  Introducing an all-new audio effect - Elgato DeEsser. De-esser reduces excessive sibilance (harsh "s" or "sh" sounds) in vocal recordings by targeting and softening high-frequency peaks. This improves audio clarity, enhances listener comfort, and gives recordings a polished, professional quality. With its intuitive UI and built-in setup guide, start using it in just seconds.
  Get it from Marketplace for free.

  🛠️ Bug fixes and performance improvements
  - Low latency mode has been temporarily removed from the game channel.
    - 👷 Dev note: We’ve heard reports about audio not coming through the game channel and have identified the problem area down to the low latency mode. Our team has been working hard to find a fix for this issue, however we did not not want it to delay the release of the update, so the decision was made to temporarily remove the low latency mode toggle to ensure everyone has a great Wave Link experience. We expect low latency to come back in a future update. Learn more about latency and how to minimize it here.
  - Improved Marketplace connectivity which should fix an issue where clicking on login or the Marketplace button did nothing.
  - Resolved a bug where certain VST settings were not saved after making changes.
  - Updated minimum operating system requirements
    - Windows: Windows 11 or newer
    - Mac: macOS 14.2 or newer
