  What’s new in Stream Deck 6.8.1?

  This update enhances Elgato Marketplace connectivity and requires you to sign in again. After updating to Stream Deck 6.8, please log in to Marketplace to continue automatic plugin updates.

  🆕 Action Sharing
  Have you ever wanted to share a single action with a friend or colleague? Well, now you can. With Action Sharing, you can export an action from Stream Deck and share it like any other file. You can share key and dial actions, folders, Multi Actions, and more.
  Exporting an action is easy—drag an action from a key or dial onto your desktop or into a folder, or right-click and select “Export”.
  When someone sends you an action, drag the action from your file manager directly onto a key, or right-click on a key and select “Import”.

  🆕 Action Trigger for Stream Deck +
  Turn up the power of your dials to 11! See what we did there? Put simply, Action Triggers enable you to assign key actions to dials, and trigger those actions with a clockwise turn, counterclockwise turn, or dial press. So any plugin and action can work with the dials, even if they don’t have built-in dial support!
