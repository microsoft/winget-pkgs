  What’s new in Stream Deck 6.9?
  Plenty. This update brings smarter ways to open apps, paste text, and lots more—plus a fresh layer of quality-of-life improvements.
  Let’s dive in.

  The minimum requirements for operating systems are changing with this release.
  - macOS 11 Big Sur → macOS 13 Ventura.
  - Windows 10 → Windows 11.
  Microsoft is ending support for Windows 10 in October 2025. Stream Deck should continue to work on Windows 10, however, we cannot guarantee full functionality.

  🆕 Open App - From launch to close, all on one key
  Launching your favorite apps just got easier. The new Open Application action shows a searchable list of installed programs—no file path hunting required.
  And it now works with Windows Store (UWP) apps like Discord, Spotify, and Microsoft Teams.
  ✨ Pro tip: Press and hold the key to close the app. Quick in, quick out.

  📝 Text Action – Now with Clipboard Paste Mode
  The Text action now includes paste mode selection with options for simulating typing or pasting from clipboard. Simulate typing is exactly that—its as if you're typing the text. Paste from Clipboard is new and text is pasted as if you’ve pressed CTRL/CMD+V. The default mode has been changed to Paste from Clipboard.
  - Simulate Typing is useful for programs that need inputs, like typing out commands in sim games
  - Paste from Clipboard is useful for chat applications, when you want to paste a block of text as a single message

  🌐 Website Action – Choose Your Browser
  Now you can choose exactly where your Website actions open. Chrome for work, Firefox for dev, Safari for testing—it’s all up to you.
  Just pick from your installed browsers in the dropdown. The old “GET request in background” toggle now lives here too, tucked away for power users.

  ⬇️ Profiles just got smarter
  Importing profiles from Marketplace? Stream Deck 6.9 now helps you hit the ground running. If a profile uses actions from plugins you don’t have, you’ll be prompted to install them automatically—no guesswork, no more question marks.
  Note: This only applies to profiles created with Stream Deck 6.9 or later.*

  🪄 Quality of life improvements
  A few small touches make a big difference:
  - Option to launch Stream Deck on startup
  - Option to disable automatic update checks
  - macOS only: Stream Deck now appears in the Dock when open
  - macOS only: You can now maximize the app using the green button

  🛠️ Bug fixes and performance improvements
  - Streamlabs Desktop actions are now a plugin. When you update to 6.9, these actions may show a ❓ until you install the new plugin. Don’t worry—your settings will be preserved.
  - Fixed a bug where the Open action wouldn’t work on USB drives after replugging.
