  üÜï Action Trigger for Stream Deck +
  Turn up the power of your dials to 11! See what we did there? Put simply, Action Triggers enable you to assign key actions to dials, and trigger those actions with a clockwise turn, counterclockwise turn, or dial press. So any plugin and action can work with the dials, even if they don‚Äôt have built-in dial support!
