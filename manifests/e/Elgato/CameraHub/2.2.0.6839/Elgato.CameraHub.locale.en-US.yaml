  üîÉ Prompter UI improvements
  Prompter now has more flexibility with new display and scrolling options.
  - Orientation: Rotate the display 90¬∞, 180¬∞, or 270¬∞, or flip it horizontally.
  - Word Matching: In Voice Sync mode, choose whether to highlight text word by word or keep the entire line highlighted until you read it.

  üõ†Ô∏è Improvements and bug fixes
  - Support added for multiple Prompters. Only one can be active at a time, and inactive Prompters automatically switch to display mode.
  - Camera Hub now warns you if Prompter is set to mirrored mode on Windows and needs to be switched to extended mode.
