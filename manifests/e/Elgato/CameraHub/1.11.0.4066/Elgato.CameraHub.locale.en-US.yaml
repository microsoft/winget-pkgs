  What‚Äôs new in Camera Hub 1.11?

  Powered by AI and machine learning, Voice Sync* ensures your script moves only when you speak. It adapts to your reading pace‚Äîwhether you speed up, slow down, or pause, the text follows your lead. Skip a line? Voice Sync adjusts seamlessly. Go off-topic? It waits for you to resume.
