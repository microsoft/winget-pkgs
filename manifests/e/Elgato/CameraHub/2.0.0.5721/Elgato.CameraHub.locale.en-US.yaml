  What’s new in Camera Hub 2.0?
  We’re hyped to unveil the latest Camera Hub update and deliver improvements across the board. Add cinematic color grading with LUTs, let Voice Sync scroll in even more languages, and download backgrounds in one click with Marketplace. Let’s dive in.

  🎨 Cinematic color with LUTs
  Camera Hub now supports Look-Up Tables (LUTs) for professional-grade color tuning. A first for webcam software, you now have direct access to LUTs and community-created filters.
  To get started, select a LUT in the Effects tab, then open your app—OBS Studio, Zoom, etc.—and select “Elgato Virtual Camera” as your video device.
  Find your look on Marketplace

  👆 1-click installation with Marketplace integration
  Elgato Marketplace is built right into Camera Hub, making it easier than ever to browse and install virtual backgrounds and LUTs. Just log in from the top-right menu, and you’re in.
  Get backgrounds or LUTs on Marketplace

  👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Voice Sync supports more languages
  Voice Sync now supports even more languages, including Finnish, Greek, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Romanian, Russian, Swedish, Turkish, and Vietnamese.

  ⬆️ General Voice Sync enhancements
  - Phrase-by-phrase highlighting helps you stay on track as you read.
  - New visual indicator makes adjusting your reading position easier.
  - Improved stability prevents Voice Sync from getting stuck in "Getting ready" mode.
  - Real-time mic detection lets you switch microphones seamlessly during sessions.

  ⬆️ General Prompter improvements
  - Script edits now save automatically every minute.
  - New info button in Preferences gives you quick access to supported hotkeys.

  ⌨️ Window to Prompter with Stream Deck
  Dragging Windows to Prompter can be a drag. Now, instantly move your active window or application directly to Prompter with a single Stream Deck action—perfect for presentations and meetings.
  Make sure you’re logged into Stream Deck to get the latest update or get the plugin from Marketplace.

  🏎️ Overall performance optimizations
  Camera Hub 2.0 starts faster, runs smoother, and uses less memory. It's snappier than ever.
  - Virtual camera video no longer freezes when switching tabs or opening/closing Camera Hub from the system tray.
  - Optimized memory usage for better overall performance.
  - Fixed a memory leak when using Cam Link 4K with no signal.

  🛠️ General improvement and heads-up
  - Fixed a green virtual camera output issue in Zoom on macOS.
  - EpocCam end-of-life notice: EpocCam will no longer receive updates. Existing users can continue using it, but please note that functionality may diminish over time. We truly appreciate your support and rest assured, we’ll share exciting new developments with you soon.
  - This update increases the minimum Windows OS requirement to Windows 11. Microsoft is ending Windows 10 support in October 2025. Camera Hub 2.0 should continue to work on Windows 10, however full functionality is not guaranteed.
  - This update increases the minimum macOS requirement to macOS 13.3 Ventura.
