  What‚Äôs new in 4K Capture Utility 1.7.14?
  üÜï Updated Audio/Video Processing
  This update moves audio/video encoding and decoding to the popular FFmpeg multimedia framework, which comes with numerous performance improvements and adds additional supported capture formats.
  - AMD - Record up to 4K60 HDR.
    - Requires AMD GPU with Video Core Next 1.0 or newer. Learn more
  4K60 HDR and other formats require a compatible capture device. Encoding performance is not guaranteed and varies based on individual system specs.

  üõ†Ô∏è Bug fixes & performance improvements
  - Cam Link Pro: Added the ability to turn off Multiview for Input 1, which stops signals lower than 4K60 from upscaling to 4K60 and outputs the exact incoming resolution and frame rate.
  - HDR video playback in the library is now CUDA accelerated with compatible NVIDIA GPU
  - Improved Flashback performance when using AMD GPU encoder
  - Resolved an issue preventing EDIDs with ultrawide formats from being loaded onto capture devices
