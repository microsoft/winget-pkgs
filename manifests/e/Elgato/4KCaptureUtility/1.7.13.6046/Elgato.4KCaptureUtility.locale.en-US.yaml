  What’s new in 4K Capture Utility 1.17.13?

  🆕 Capture Ultrawide video with 4K X
  4K X now supports capturing popular ultrawide display formats 3440x1440 and 2560x1080.
  - Additional ultrawide formats may work, though they have not been validated by Elgato.
  To get started capturing ultrawide with 4K X, take a look at this guide.

  🛠️ Bug fixes & performance improvements
  - Improved 4K X initialization time when launching 4K Capture Utility
  - Resolved an issue where “Device is in use” would appear when launching 4K Capture Utility for 4K X even though the device is not in use
  - The 4K Pro driver has been updated to 1.1.202.7, which fixes color issues when switching from RGB to NV12 or YUY2 in apps like OBS Studio
