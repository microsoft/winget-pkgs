  - For all skin tones: Adjust brightness and color temperature.
  - Built-in controls: Fine-tune settings and switch modes with ease.

  - Seamless mounting: Sits comfy on monitors and laptop screens.
  - Compact design: Takes up zero desktop real estate, fits in a laptop bag.

  🛠️ Wi-Fi pairing improvements:
  - Network list: Control Center now only displays Wi-Fi networks that are compatible with your accessory.
  - Frequency bands: Now you can select your preferred frequency band during the Wi-Fi pairing process. Choose between automatic (2.4 GHz by default), 2.4 GHz, and 5 GHz.
  - Remember my network: When adding a new accessory, Control Center automatically selects the Wi-Fi network to which your computer is currently connected—making setup faster and easier.

  🛠️ Bug fixes & performance improvements
  - Firmware 1.0.3 (220) for Key Light Air is now available which fixes a specific problem where it could no longer be reached via the network.
