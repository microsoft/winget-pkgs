ShortDescription: Ebbflow Client and Proxy
Description: This is the end-host client for ebbflow. This is used to proxy SSH or TCP connections between ebbflow and your local server. It typically runs as a daemon which is initiated during the install process, but can also be ran directly which suits containers.
