ShortDescription: EDPB Website Auditing Tool
Description: The EDPB website auditing tool helps analyse whether websites are compliant with the law. The new tool allows the preparation, completion and evaluation of audits directly in the tool by a simple visit to the website concerned. The EDPB website auditing tool was developed in the context of the EDPB Support Pool of Experts (SPE) and can be used by both legal and technical auditors at data protection authorities (DPAs), as well as by controllers and processors who wish to test their own websites.
