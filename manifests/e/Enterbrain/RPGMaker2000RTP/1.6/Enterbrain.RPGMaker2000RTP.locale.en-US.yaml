ShortDescription: RTP is a system for reducing the total size of a game file made with RPG Maker.
Description: RTP is a system for reducing the total size of a game file made with RPG Maker. RTPs contain the graphics, music, and .dll files used when creating a game. Once a game is made with RTP data, you do not need to include material data like music or graphic files. This significantly reduces the file size of the game.
