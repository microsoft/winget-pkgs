  Bug fixes:
  - Show a user-friendly error message when files.â€‹log is missing during the uninstallation
  - macOS code signing: Constrain the value written to CFBundleShortVersionString to fix code signing issues
  - The value of the macOS entitlements file setting was not saved as a path, which led to problems building on a different platform
  - External signing or post-processing executables were sometimes run in parallel, which could lead to problems
  - "Disable notarization" check box was only visible on macOS
  - Do not set a security manager for Java 17+ to avoid warnings
  - For signing with external executables, the temporary launchers now have an .exe suffix to fulfill the requirements of some code signing tools
  - "Text field with integer format" form component: When the "Maximum number of digits" property was set and more digits than the maximum number of digits were entered, all numbers were shifted to the left instead of rejecting the new digit
  - "Text field with integer format" form component: When the "Minimum number of digits" property was set and the "Allow invalid input" property was not set, the user could not overwrite the leading zeros after the first typed digit
