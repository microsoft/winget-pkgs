ReleaseNotes: |-
  New features:
  - Added an optional autoProvisioningCacheDir property to Gradle, Maven, and Ant integrations
  - The install4j runtime API, the install4j Maven plugin, and the JDK provider API are now published on Maven Central
  - macOS media files: Support bookmark files in the additional files for the DMG (media wizard → Installer options → DMG options and files)
  - Added support for separate JMOD archives from JDK providers. This is required for creating modularized Adoptium JRE bundles starting with 24.​0.2
  Bug fixes:
  - "Run executable or batch file" action: If a path to an .exe file was specified without the .exe extension, it was launched like a batch file instead of being launched directly. This could lead to compatibility problems for argument resolution.
  - Prevent the output of "WARNING: A restricted method in java.​lang.​System has been called" when running installers with Java 24+
  - Prevent errors in console and unattended mode due to the removed security manager in Java 24+
  - Parallel uploading to the Apple notarization server could lead to failures
  - On macOS, file choosers and alerts did not disable top-level menu entries if they were displayed right after a modal dialog was hidden
