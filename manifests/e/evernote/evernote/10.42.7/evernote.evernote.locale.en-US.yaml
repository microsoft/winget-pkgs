  New:
  - The app will now auto-populate new note titles when you click into the title field. "Sounds cool," we hear you say, "but what does it mean?" It's like this: Let's say the first line of content in your note is something like "Team meeting, June 23rd." 
    Simply click in the title field and the app will instantly make that your note's title, without any extra effort on your part. You can change it later if you want, but think of the time you'll save!
  - Tag your notes quicker! Drag a tag from the sidebar or the tags menu directly into a note to apply it to that note.
  - We've added a new keyboard shortcut! Instantly open the new Settings menu by clicking Cmd + , on Mac or Ctrl + , on Windows and Linux. And if Settings is already open, you can use the same shortcut to close it.
  - We've added a new filter to the Tasks view to show you only your recurring tasks.
