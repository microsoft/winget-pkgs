ShortDescription: A powerful tool for translating Help+Manual documentation projects
Description: |-
  Help+Manual Translation Assistant (HMTA) is a powerful tool for translating Help+Manual documentation projects. It has all the features translators need to perform both original translations and updates.

  Includes AI-based DeepL machine translation
    The regular translation features are combined with the amazing power of DeepL machine translation. Powered by advanced artificial intelligence systems, DeepL produces translations that are massively better than anything you have seen before. Where machine translation used to be more of a joke, with DeepL you get a genuinely usable translation that usually only requires minimal editing. Professional translators have described the results as "frighteningly good".
    Using DeepL can save you well over 90% of your regular translation costs and time.

  Key features of Help+Manual Translation Assistant
  - Side-by-side views and comparisons of the original project and the translation
  - DeepL machine translation with bulk translation of the entire project
  - Side-by side views with content comparison of old and new original for updating translations
  - WYSIWYG editor with full support for Help+Manual formatting and styles tools
