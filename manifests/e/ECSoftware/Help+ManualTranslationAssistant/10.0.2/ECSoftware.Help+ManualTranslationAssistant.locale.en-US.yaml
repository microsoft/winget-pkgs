ShortDescription: A powerful tool for translating Help+Manual documentation projects
Description: |-
  Help+Manual Translation Assistant (HMTA) is a powerful tool for translating Help+Manual documentation projects. It has all the features translators need to perform both original translations and updates.

  Includes AI-based DeepL machine translation
    The regular translation features are combined with the amazing power of DeepL machine translation. Powered by advanced artificial intelligence systems, DeepL produces translations that are massively better than anything you have seen before. Where machine translation used to be more of a joke, with DeepL you get a genuinely usable translation that usually only requires minimal editing. Professional translators have described the results as "frighteningly good".
    Using DeepL can save you well over 90% of your regular translation costs and time.

  Key features of Help+Manual Translation Assistant
  - Side-by-side views and comparisons of the original project and the translation
  - DeepL machine translation with bulk translation of the entire project
  - Side-by side views with content comparison of old and new original for updating translations
  - WYSIWYG editor with full support for Help+Manual formatting and styles tools

ReleaseNotes: |-
  We are glad to announce the immediate availability of Help+Manual 10.0.2 and Translation Assistant 10.0.2!
  Help+Manual 10.0.2 Changes
  - Publishing Tasks: in dark mode, publishing multiple task entries created an error.
  - Insert Snippet dialog: mouse wheel support did not scroll the listbox of snippet topics.
  - The syntax editor always converted tabs to spaces. Syntax editors are used for XML topic source code and for HTML code in various dialogs.
  - German UI: visual glitches in Insert Link dialog and bullet list selection fixed.
  - Additional symbols implemented in Customize List Style dialog.
  - Config > Common > Text Variables: spacing of variables grid was larger than normal.
  Translation Assistant 10.0.2 Changes
  - Side selection in session window did not work on a single mouse click: a single click on any tree column must activate this side.
  - Copying (new) topic sub-folders from one project to another had a small bug: the resulting topics were copied but not correctly listed under this folder in Help+Manual. Instead, the topic files were listed separately.
  - Dialogs updated to match Help+Manual 10.0.2 (Customize List Style, Insert Snippet, etc.)
  All updates are available from our download page.
