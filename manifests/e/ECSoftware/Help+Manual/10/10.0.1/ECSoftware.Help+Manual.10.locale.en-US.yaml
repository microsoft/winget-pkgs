ShortDescription: Windows help and documentation tool
Description: |-
  Help+Manual is a single-source help authoring and content management system for both single and multi-author editing. Working with Help+Manual is as easy as writing text with a word processor. Help+Manual scales from small to really large projects with thousands of pages and creates Windows help files, Webhelp and manuals in print and PDF format. Try yourself and download a trial of Help+Manual! Writing help has never been easier.

  Help+Manuals working environment gives you all the formatting and editing features of a modern word processor, including dynamic styles and complex tables. The software creates all classic help file and documentation formats:
  * Microsoft HTML Help (.chm)
  * Visual Studio Help
  * Webhelp for integration into your website
  * User manuals in Adobe PDF format
  * Apple iPad e-books

  Features:
  * Multiple output from one single source
  * All outputs are highly customizeable
  * PDF manuals with active hyperlinks
  * Built-in multi-user authoring capabilities
  * Tools includes: reports, translation assistants, image and screen shot tools

  Single source, Multiple output
  Single source is much more than just outputting exactly the same information to different formats. Help+Manual supports conditional and customized output features that enable you to include variant content versions for different output formats and purposes - all in the same project, no post-processing is required.

  Help+Manual handles all the complexities of help formatting and generation for you, letting you concentrate on the work of writing. But there is also extensive support for power users and experienced help authors. You can get under the hood and insert your own HTML code, change the code the program uses to generate your projects, manipulate topic and project templates and more.

  Help+Manual gives you the best of both worlds.
