ShortDescription: Windows help and documentation tool
Description: |-
  Help+Manual is a single-source help authoring and content management system for both single and multi-author editing. Working with Help+Manual is as easy as writing text with a word processor. Help+Manual scales from small to really large projects with thousands of pages and creates Windows help files, Webhelp and manuals in print and PDF format. Try yourself and download a trial of Help+Manual! Writing help has never been easier.

  Help+Manuals working environment gives you all the formatting and editing features of a modern word processor, including dynamic styles and complex tables. The software creates all classic help file and documentation formats:
  * Microsoft HTML Help (.chm)
  * Visual Studio Help
  * Webhelp for integration into your website
  * User manuals in Adobe PDF format
  * Apple iPad e-books

  Features:
  * Multiple output from one single source
  * All outputs are highly customizeable
  * PDF manuals with active hyperlinks
  * Built-in multi-user authoring capabilities
  * Tools includes: reports, translation assistants, image and screen shot tools

  Single source, Multiple output
  Single source is much more than just outputting exactly the same information to different formats. Help+Manual supports conditional and customized output features that enable you to include variant content versions for different output formats and purposes - all in the same project, no post-processing is required.

  Help+Manual handles all the complexities of help formatting and generation for you, letting you concentrate on the work of writing. But there is also extensive support for power users and experienced help authors. You can get under the hood and insert your own HTML code, change the code the program uses to generate your projects, manipulate topic and project templates and more.

  Help+Manual gives you the best of both worlds.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  We are happy to announce the immediate availability of Help+Manual 10.0.3 and Translation Assistant 10.0.3! This update comes with a few bug fixes and one very convenient new feature.
  Automatic Image Refresh
  When you edit a picture in a topic with SnipSVG (or any other image editor), Help+Manual automatically refreshes the image, once you switch back to the application. We have put a great effort into this check-and-auto-refresh function, to make it lightening fast. It is on by default, but you can switch it off in Program Options.
  Problem Fix with Open Dialogs
  Help+Manual 10 has new open and save dialogs, that match the skin (light/dark) and feature an integrated preview for many file types. These new dialogs have caused delays with two customers. The symptom was a delay of more than half a minute, before the dialogs appeared. We were able to track this down to an incompatibility with 3rd party apps, that inject custom overlay icons in Windows Explorer. If you happened to experience such a delay with any of the open/save dialogs, the problem should now be solved.
  YouTube Videos
  YouTube has once again changed their policy and sometimes refuses to show embedded videos. The typical YouTube error is “501 Configuration Error”. For local HTML, that is unfortunately normal. For HTML pages running on a web server, it should work. We have implemented two modifications to avoid this problem. If you still experience issues with YouTube videos on a web server, please contact us.
  Help+Manual 10.0.3 Changes
  - Automatic image refresh after external changes to pictures in topics.
  - Open and save dialogs: problem fix for 3rd party overlay icons.
  - Save dialogs: changing file type now changes filename extension.
  - Publishing tasks / task editor: scrollbar for include options was sometimes not visible.
  - Print Manual dialog: access violation in dropdown lists fixed
  - Sorting glitch in topics files list fixed
  - YouTube videos: attribute referrerpolicy=”strict-origin-when-cross-origin” added to the <iframe> tag. Furthermore, you can replace the hard-coded YouTube url with www.youtube-nocookie.com. This mod is still experimental and must be activated with a registry setting. Please contact us for more details if you face problems with embedded YouTube videos.
  - Russian CHM and PDF files: meta data encoding problem fixed.
  - SnipSVG: the version integrated with Help+Manual (build 502) received a small change regarding the autosize function: when applying a shadow to a picture, the autosize function calculates the required margins. The margins are now rounded to full integer pixels to avoid placing objects on sub-pixel positions, which led to a slight interpolation in some cases.
  Translation Assistant 10.0.3 Changes
  - Open and save dialogs: problem fix for 3rd party overlay icons.
  - Save dialogs: changing file type now changes filename extension.
