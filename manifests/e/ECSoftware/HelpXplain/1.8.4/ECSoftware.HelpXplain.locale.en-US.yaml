ShortDescription: HelpXplain - Simply tell it with pictures
Description: |-
  HelpXplain is the perfect tool to create HTML-based step-by-step instructions.
  Create animated step-by-step tutorials and quick instructions in minutes instead of hours. The magic is in the method: it animates a series of simple screenshots, each of which can be edited or replaced at any time.
  HelpXplain can also record multi-page screencasts of programs on your computer screen that run in autoplay mode like a video. Recording and editing them is massively easier than trying to create a video!
  All Xplains are 100% standards-compliant HTML5 and Javascript, 100% responsive and cross-platform. With an overhead small enough to load in less than a second!
