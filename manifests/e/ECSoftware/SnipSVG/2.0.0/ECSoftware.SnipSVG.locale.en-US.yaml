ShortDescription: Free Screen Capture and Image Editing Utility.
Description: |-
  SnipSVG is a screen capture and graphics editor that uses SVG vector images as its primary format.
  SVG images can be used directly in HTML and many other applications. They give you the same sharp quality at all zoom settings, and unlike JPG or PNG images you can always edit all the elements of the image separately.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  We are happy to announce the first major update of our freeware image editor SnipSVG!
  This version 2.0 is really a big update, here are the new features at a glance:
  - Animations: create animated SVG images with SnipSVG
  - New objects: text tables, curved text, web videos
  - Create custom shapes by combining shapes
  - Updated screen capture with window-sizer

  What’s new in SnipSVG 2.0?
  Let’s start with the smaller news in order to not let them go unnoticed in this big update.
  Screen capture with window-sizer
  Have you ever tried to re-capture a screenshot and struggled to make it exactly the same size as the old one? This is what the new window sizer tool is for. It resizes a window that you want to capture to an exact pixel size. The function is right where you need it: it comes up with a right-click during the screen capture. Select from a list of predefined common sizes or enter the exact values you need.

  Screen capture with Windows 11 border trimming
  Most application windows on Windows 11 have rounded corners and a translucent 1-pixel border around them. The updated screen capture tool trims the borders automatically, but you can switch this option on or off. To apply rounded corners, use the trim-corners function in SnipSVG.

  Insert shapes of any form
  SnipSVG has a comprehensive library of predefined shapes for quick insert. But no matter how many, no library is ever enough. Now you can create your own shapes by combining existing shapes. Simply select 2 or more shapes and add, subtract or intersect them.

  And, mind you, there is also the copy & paste function for SVG icons, which is perfectly suited to insert royalty free icons from the web.

  New objects
  SnipSVG 2.0 comes with tables, curved text and web videos. Tables are HTML tables, embedded into the SVG image. They can contain formatted text and simply display tabular data. In screenshots, we might rarely need them, but when we do, this is an irreplaceable feature.

  Last, not least, you can embed web videos into SVG files. YouTube, Vimeo, HelpXplain and any other website or web video you may come up with. All web content has a local (embedded) preview image and displays in a lightbox when clicked.

  Animations
  We have implemented a complete animation studio in SnipSVG to create animated SVG files. All animations in screenshots are interactive. That is, they play after a user interaction like a mouse move or click.
  The animations are compatible with all modern web browser and mostly use CSS transitions, with a small piece of javascript where required. This means that our animated SVGs are very small and unlike, for instance, Lottie animations, they are self-contained without requiring external libraries.

  Miscellaneous New Features
  - Lighbox support: any object that links to an external web address can display this content in a lightbox. Web videos use the lightbox option by default.
  - Confirm Close dialog: checkbox added to apply the choice to all tabs (close all with or without save).
  - Save-As dialog: optionally shows HTML embed code for SVG file.
  - Text objects: improved rendering of plain-text fallback (mostly relevant for SVGs in CHM files).
  - The Share dialog has an option to open the exported file with the default application.
  - Color dialog supports copy & paste of hex color values.

  Download
  All downloads for Windows and macOS are available from the SnipSVG website.
