ReleaseNotes: |-
  This release includes the following (notable) new features, improvements and bug fixes:
  - Added support for Dilicom library connector (not OPDS, special API).
  - Localisation: fixed French, Spanish, Portuguese (Portugal) and Swedish translations. Added the EDRLab.org documentation website link to all locales, in the "about Thorium" XHTML (the link currently redirects to a GitHub microsite that hosts Thorium's user guide).
  - Added basic "telemetry" feature: anonymous system information sent to EDRLab server on application startup.
  - Fixed reader window menus which were not closed automatically when switching to fullscreen.
  - Fixed README documentation, updated supported languages.
