ReleaseNotes: |-
  - New and updated translations: Bulgarian, Greek, Croatian, Korean, Portuguese (Portugal).
  - Reader / image zoom: major feature update from initial proof of concept, better user experience (finger touch, trackpad gestures, mouse wheel, keyboard), support for raster/bitmap images as well as SVG markup.
  - Reader / MathML: native rendering in Chromium (Electron v25), Thorium 2.2.0 included a version of Chromium that did not support MathML natively (MathJax was the only way to display MathML).
  - Reader / MathML: MathJax dynamic aria-label (speech text) is overridden by authored alt-text (if present), Thorium TTS readaloud speaks it, screen readers do too but have the option to dig further / deeper into the MathML structure (useful with screen reader specialised plugins).
  - Reader / navigation history: hyperlink activation now correctly sets the landmark for previous/next navigation.
  - Reader / text display: fixed left/right/justify text alignement ("start" can be left or right depending on document language), "automatic" is now "default" with changed SVG icon to avoid confusion.
  - Reader / UX: finger swipe gesture can now be used to turn pages (requires touch screen).
  - Reader text selection: double-click now works (bookmarks label for now, later in upcoming annotations feature).
  - Reader / TTS: fixed aria-label support on img (alongside alt attribute), epub:type pagebreak (and role doc- prefix), title/label takes precedence over inner text, same with links.
    NOTE: this will need future update to match W3C specifications for computation of accessible label and description.
  - Reader / TTS: fixed voice selection based on user choice + language match (for example: fr-FR vs. fr-CA variants, en-US vs. en-UK, user wins over authored lang).
  - Reader / TTS: fixed paused / stopped state in playback controls.
  - Reader / TTS: fixed support for Japanese ruby, RT markup is now ignored.
  - Reader / TTS: captions / simplified view, initial text without active word boundary was not escaped (ampersand character).
  - Reader / Popup footnotes: fixed handling of SVG a@href links.
  - Reader / HTML5 audio: fixed visible controls visibility.
  - Reader / EPUB: navigator.epubReadingSystem object injection in iframes (including SVG).
  - Reader / EPUB: FXL fixed-layout rendition-prefixed page-spread-left/center/right properties on spine item, was only parsing non-prefixed variant.
  - Reader / Media Overlays: fixed click on non-synchronised HTML element which now preserves current playback location / timestamp (was reseting to begining of document).
  - Reader / UX: mouse middle-click was causing opening in external Electron window.
  - DAISY: fixed v2.02 and v3.0 import of ncc.html or *.opf, now works when loading from non-zipped publications.
  - OPDS: feed entry fallback cascade was too permissive (publication info was incorrectly fetching borrow/buy links in some cases).
  - OPDS: fixed "search" relative URLs in OPDS1(XML) and OPDS2(JSON), fixed URI Templates curly brace escaping in URL path.
  - OPDS: fixed publication title which was not displayed.
  - OPDS: added display of accessibility metadata.
  - GUI: fixed dark/night and sepia modes in audiobook playback rate chooser and TTS + Media Overlays rate/voice choosers.
  - GUI: fixed edge-case of auto-focus fail on default dialog button (e.g. invoking the delete action from the popup menu was failing to auto-focus the default ok button, whereas this worked when reaching the same modal dialog prompt via the publication info sheet).
  - GUI / accessibility: improved keyboard shortcuts editor usability, for both screen reader and keyboard users
  - GUI / UX: improved error message during file import, unsupported extension / document type.
  - TTS: now enabled by default on Linux (Electron command line parameter "enable-speech-dispatcher").
