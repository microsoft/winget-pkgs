ReleaseNotes: |-
  NetSpeedTray v1.2.1: The Absolute Performance Update
  This release is a major stable milestone that delivers definitive performance overhauls and critical stabilization fixes. It introduces vectorized graph processing, a dedicated background monitoring thread, and resolves multiple regressions identified in previous 1.2.x iterations.
  🚀 Highlights
  Definitive Graph Performance
  We have eliminated all bottlenecks in the graph window to provide a silky-smooth experience:
  - Zero-Latency Switching: Timeline switching is now instantaneous. We removed blocking database sleeps and implemented a Sequence ID system that instantly drops obsolete render requests.
  - 42x Speed Improvement: By replacing legacy loops with vectorized NumPy processing, the graph now handles massive historical datasets with ease.
  - Session View as Default: The graph now opens instantly to your high-resolution active session, ensuring you see data the moment you need it.
  ⚡ Background Monitoring (Zero-Stutter)
  - Dedicated Monitor Thread: Network polling is now fully offloaded to a background QThread. This prevents the main UI from "micro-stuttering" during network spikes, ensuring the widget moves at a constant 60+ FPS.
  - Pandas Completely Removed: The application is now lighter and launches significantly faster without the heavy pandas dependency.
  🎨 Refined Architecture
  - Modular Settings: The Settings dialog has been completely rebuilt into a modular system, improving stability and allowing for easier feature expansion.
  - Robust Taskbar Detection: Integrated multi-layered fallbacks for Windows taskbar detection, ensuring the widget remains positioned correctly even during Explorer restarts.
  ✨ New Features
  - Localization: Added full support for Korean (ko_KR) and Slovenian (sl_SI), with 100% translation parity across all 9 supported languages.
  - Unit Customization: Precise control over Mbps vs MB/s and Decimal vs Binary units.
  - Safe Migrations: A new versioned database migration system protects your data integrity during updates.
  🐛 Critical Bug Fixes
  - Memory Leak (Ghost Windows): Fixed an issue where the graph window would remain hidden but active in memory after closing.
  - Matplotlib Epoch Fix: Resolved the "Empty Graph" bug caused by Matplotlib's internal date handling mismatch.
  - #77 (Vertical Taskbar): Bottom-aligned the widget on vertical taskbars and hardened "always-on-top" behavior.
  - #64 (Stuck 0.00 Mbps): Meters now react to background traffic below 80kbps.
  - #78 (Accuracy & Lag Resilience): Increased validity thresholds to 10s to prevent fake speed drops during system stutter.
