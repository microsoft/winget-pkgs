ShortDescription: Host Availability and Connection Quality Monitoring Tool
Description: EMCO Ping Monitor software helps you to monitor the up/down state and the connection quality of network devices. The tool can send you notifications when the host state or the connection quality of the monitored hosts change. For every host, the program collects detailed statistics including the uptime, outages, latency and other monitoring metrics, so you can analyze the host performance during any historical period and generate detailed reports.
