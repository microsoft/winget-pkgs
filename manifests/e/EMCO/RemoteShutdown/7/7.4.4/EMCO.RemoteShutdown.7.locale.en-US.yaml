ShortDescription: Remote power and system management tool for executing shutdown, reboot, Wake-on-LAN, logoff, lock, and other remote actions on Windows PCs over a network.
Description: |-
  EMCO Remote Shutdown is a centralized power management solution that allows administrators to remotely shutdown, reboot, power off, wake up (using Wake-on-LAN), and manage Windows computers across a network. It enables performing operations on multiple machines simultaneously without physical access.
