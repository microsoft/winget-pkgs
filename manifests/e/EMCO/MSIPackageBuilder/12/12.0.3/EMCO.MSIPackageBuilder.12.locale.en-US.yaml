ShortDescription: The premier tool for creating MSI, MSIX, and IntuneWin packages and repackaging existing installations for deployment.
Description: |
  EMCO MSI Package Builder is a premier Windows installer creation and repackaging tool designed for IT professionals. It allows you to build MSI, MSIX, and IntuneWin packages either manually using a visual MSI editor or automatically by monitoring system changes during software installations.
  
  The product makes it easy to convert non-silent EXE installers into deployment-ready packages suitable for automated distribution through Microsoft Intune, Group Policy, SCCM, and other endpoint management systems. It also provides advanced customization features, including adding pre- and post-install actions, managing files and registry entries, and wrapping existing installers — all without scripting or low-level MSI knowledge.
