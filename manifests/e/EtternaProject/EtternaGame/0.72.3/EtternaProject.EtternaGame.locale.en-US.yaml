ShortDescription: Advanced cross-platform rhythm game focused on keyboard play
Description: |-
  Etterna is a cross-platform rhythm game similar to Dance Dance Revolution.
  It started as a fork of StepMania 5 (v5.0.12), with a focus on keyboard players.
  Over time, Etterna evolved into its own game, with in-game multiplayer, the online scoreboard Etterna Online, and a community of over 4,000 players.
