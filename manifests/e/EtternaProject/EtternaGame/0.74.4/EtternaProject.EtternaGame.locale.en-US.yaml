ShortDescription: Advanced cross-platform rhythm game focused on keyboard play
Description: |-
  Etterna is a cross-platform rhythm game similar to Dance Dance Revolution.
  It started as a fork of StepMania 5 (v5.0.12), with a focus on keyboard players.
  Over time, Etterna evolved into its own game, with in-game multiplayer, the online scoreboard Etterna Online, and a community of over 4,000 players.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  [0.74.4] - 2025-04-01
  As always, back up your Save. That includes any personal modifications to the Assets folder, Noteskins folder, and the entire Save folder. These folders are usually found in the folder your game is installed.
  If you made modifications to Theme files for your custom windows, you will need to save that specific Lua file as well.
  MacOS Note
  OpenSSL is required. It can be installed with Homebrew:
  NOTE: If you don't have Homebrew installed already, follow the instructions from the Homebrew website.
  brew install openssl
  Linux Note
  It has come to our attention that newer versions of some distributions like Ubuntu make it difficult to install the required OpenSSL libraries to run the game. If you try to open the game and are hit with an error complaining about OPENSSL_1_1_1 not found despite following proper instructions to install it, try this:
  wget http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/o/openssl/libssl1.1_1.1.1f-1ubuntu2_amd64.deb
  sudo dpkg -i libssl1.1_1.1.1f-1ubuntu2_amd64.deb

  - There are 2 versions of this release. The other version is an April Fools edition with removed Jacks/Chordjacks and funny translated text. Both versions are nearly identical in the executable besides SQLiteCpp

  - Changed the minimum cmake version for every dependency to 3.5 because GHA refuses to work suddenly
