ReleaseNotes: |-
  - 7-Zip for Windows can now use more than 64 CPU threads for compression to zip/7z/xz archives and for the 7-Zip benchmark. If there are more than one processor group in Windows (on systems with more than 64 cpu threads), 7-Zip distributes running CPU threads across different processor groups.
  - bzip2 compression speed was increased by 15-40%.
  - deflate (zip/gz) compression speed was increased by 1-3%.
  - improved support for zip, cpio and fat archives.
  - fixed some bugs and vulnerabilities.
