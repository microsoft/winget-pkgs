  Hello, World!
  Hey, I'm Qoder! It's great to meet you. As an Agentic Coding Platform, I'm here to help you solve real software tasks.
  Let me show you how we can build amazing things together:
  - Code Suggestion: Predict your next edit with codebase-awareness, inline suggestions. Just Tab and stay in a state of continuous, rapid coding.
  - Ask Mode: Solve coding problems right in your IDE. No more context-switching, just solutions that keep you in the flow.
  - Agent Mode: Coding through conversation. You maintain full control through human-in-the-loop checkpoints, turning your ideas into reality.
  - Quest Mode: We'll start by co-designing a technical specification. Then you can delegate the task to me. I'll handle it autonomously and leave you to simply review the final result.
  - Repo Wiki: Understand the codebase in minutes. I'll generate documentation of architecture, design patterns, and module logic once you open a project, so you can understand the project immediately.
  Under the hood, I'm equipped with powerful built-in tools, enhanced context engine. This allows me to assist you with incredible efficiency and precision, making me a partner that truly understands your work.
  Let's explore the future of programming and start our amazing AI coding journey together!
