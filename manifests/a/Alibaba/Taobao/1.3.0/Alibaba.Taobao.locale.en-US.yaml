Description: |-
  Taobao Desktop is a new desktop client for Taobao users to enhance the shopping experience on PC. It serves as an extension of the Taobao web version, inheriting its core functionalities while leveraging the capabilities of the operating system to provide users with faster and more efficient shopping experience.
  Due to the user interaction limitations of the browser-based web version, we aim to further optimize the PC user experience by offering a downloadable desktop application.
  Our goal is to help users quickly access Taobao anytime, anywhere on their computers, facilitate smoother communication with sellers, and fully utilize the advantages of larger screens to create unique shopping experiences.
