Description: |-
  AXIS Streaming Assistant is an application that bridges video streams from IP cameras into a Windows desktop application to enable broadcasting or conferencing use-cases.
  When AXIS Streaming Assistant is installed on a computer, it automatically discovers any Axis product on the network. The video and audio* streams from the cameras can then be used in third-party software applications such as Microsoft Teams, Zoom etc. For complete list of successfully tested applications, please read the tech note.

  Both the 32-bit version and the 64-bit version can be installed side-by-side on a system for maximal compatibility with third-party applications.
  AXIS Streaming Assistant is compatible with all Axis network cameras and video encoders. Firmware version 4.47 or higher is needed.
