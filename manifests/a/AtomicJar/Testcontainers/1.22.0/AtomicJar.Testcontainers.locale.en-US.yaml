Description: |-
  Testcontainers is an open source framework for providing throwaway, lightweight instances of databases, message brokers, web browsers, or just about anything that can run in a Docker container.

  The app lets you proxy any service to a fixed port to easily inspect it with your favorite debugging tools. For example, inspect a datastore with your IDE plugin, or manage a Kubernetes cluster with k9s. You can even freeze a service to prevent its shutdown so you can debug it.
