  Airspy is a line of Popular Software-Defined Radio (SDR) receivers developed to achieve High Performance and Affordability using
  an innovative combination of Software Architecture, DSP and RF techniques. The goal is to satisfy the most demanding telecommunications
  professionals and radio enthusiasts while being a serious alternative to both cost sensitive and high end receivers. Simply put, we
