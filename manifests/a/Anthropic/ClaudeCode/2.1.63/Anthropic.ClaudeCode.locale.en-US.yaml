ShortDescription: Unleash Claude’s raw power directly in your terminal. Search million-line codebases instantly. Turn hours-long workflows into a single command. Your tools. Your workflow. Your codebase, evolving at thought speed.
Description: |-
  Claude Code is Anthropic’s agentic coding tool that lives in your terminal and helps you turn ideas into code faster than ever before.
  What Claude Code does for you
  - Build features from descriptions: Tell Claude what you want to build in plain English. It will make a plan, write the code, and ensure it works.
  - Debug and fix issues: Describe a bug or paste an error message. Claude Code will analyze your codebase, identify the problem, and implement a fix.
  - Navigate any codebase: Ask anything about your team’s codebase, and get a thoughtful answer back. Claude Code maintains awareness of your entire project structure, can find up-to-date information from the web, and with MCP can pull from external datasources like Google Drive, Figma, and Slack.
  - Automate tedious tasks: Fix fiddly lint issues, resolve merge conflicts, and write release notes. Do all this in a single command from your developer machines, or automatically in CI.
  Why developers love Claude Code
  - Works in your terminal: Not another chat window. Not another IDE. Claude Code meets you where you already work, with the tools you already love.
  - Takes action: Claude Code can directly edit files, run commands, and create commits. Need more? MCP lets Claude read your design docs in Google Drive, update your tickets in Jira, or use your custom developer tooling.
  - Unix philosophy: Claude Code is composable and scriptable. tail -f app.log | claude -p "Slack me if you see any anomalies appear in this log stream" works. Your CI can run claude -p "If there are new text strings, translate them into French and raise a PR for @lang-fr-team to review".
  - Enterprise-ready: Use Anthropic’s API, or host on AWS or GCP. Enterprise-grade security, privacy, and compliance is built-in.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Added /simplify and /batch bundled slash commands
  - Fixed local slash command output like /cost appearing as user-sent messages instead of system messages in the UI
  - Project configs & auto memory now shared across git worktrees of the same repository
  - Added ENABLE_CLAUDEAI_MCP_SERVERS=false env var to opt out from making claude.ai MCP servers available
  - Improved /model command to show the currently active model in the slash command menu
  - Added HTTP hooks, which can POST JSON to a URL and receive JSON instead of running a shell command
  - Fixed listener leak in bridge polling loop
  - Fixed listener leak in MCP OAuth flow cleanup
  - Added manual URL paste fallback during MCP OAuth authentication. If the automatic localhost redirect doesn't work, you can paste the callback URL to complete authentication.
  - Fixed memory leak when navigating hooks configuration menu
  - Fixed listener leak in interactive permission handler during auto-approvals
  - Fixed file count cache ignoring glob ignore patterns
  - Fixed memory leak in bash command prefix cache
  - Fixed MCP tool/resource cache leak on server reconnect
  - Fixed IDE host IP detection cache incorrectly sharing results across ports
  - Fixed WebSocket listener leak on transport reconnect
  - Fixed memory leak in git root detection cache that could cause unbounded growth in long-running sessions
  - Fixed memory leak in JSON parsing cache that grew unbounded over long sessions
  - VSCode: Fixed remote sessions not appearing in conversation history
  - Fixed a race condition in the REPL bridge where new messages could arrive at the server interleaved with historical messages during the initial connection flush, causing message ordering issues.
  - Fixed memory leak where long-running teammates retained all messages in AppState even after conversation compaction
  - Fixed a memory leak where MCP server fetch caches were not cleared on disconnect, causing growing memory usage with servers that reconnect frequently
  - Improved memory usage in long sessions with subagents by stripping heavy progress message payloads during context compaction
  - Added "Always copy full response" option to the /copy picker. When selected, future /copy commands will skip the code block picker and copy the full response directly.
  - VSCode: Added session rename and remove actions to the sessions list
  - Fixed /clear not resetting cached skills, which could cause stale skill content to persist in the new conversation
