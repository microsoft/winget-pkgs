ShortDescription: Unleash Claude’s raw power directly in your terminal. Search million-line codebases instantly. Turn hours-long workflows into a single command. Your tools. Your workflow. Your codebase, evolving at thought speed.
Description: |-
  Claude Code is Anthropic’s agentic coding tool that lives in your terminal and helps you turn ideas into code faster than ever before.
  What Claude Code does for you
  - Build features from descriptions: Tell Claude what you want to build in plain English. It will make a plan, write the code, and ensure it works.
  - Debug and fix issues: Describe a bug or paste an error message. Claude Code will analyze your codebase, identify the problem, and implement a fix.
  - Navigate any codebase: Ask anything about your team’s codebase, and get a thoughtful answer back. Claude Code maintains awareness of your entire project structure, can find up-to-date information from the web, and with MCP can pull from external datasources like Google Drive, Figma, and Slack.
  - Automate tedious tasks: Fix fiddly lint issues, resolve merge conflicts, and write release notes. Do all this in a single command from your developer machines, or automatically in CI.
  Why developers love Claude Code
  - Works in your terminal: Not another chat window. Not another IDE. Claude Code meets you where you already work, with the tools you already love.
  - Takes action: Claude Code can directly edit files, run commands, and create commits. Need more? MCP lets Claude read your design docs in Google Drive, update your tickets in Jira, or use your custom developer tooling.
  - Unix philosophy: Claude Code is composable and scriptable. tail -f app.log | claude -p "Slack me if you see any anomalies appear in this log stream" works. Your CI can run claude -p "If there are new text strings, translate them into French and raise a PR for @lang-fr-team to review".
  - Enterprise-ready: Use Anthropic’s API, or host on AWS or GCP. Enterprise-grade security, privacy, and compliance is built-in.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Added support for Claude Sonnet 4.6

  - Added spinnerTipsOverride setting to customize spinner tips — configure tips with an array of custom tip strings, and optionally set excludeDefault: true to show only your custom tips instead of the built-in ones
  - Added SDKRateLimitInfo and SDKRateLimitEvent types to the SDK, enabling consumers to receive rate limit status updates including utilization, reset times, and overage information
  - Fixed Agent Teams teammates failing on Bedrock, Vertex, and Foundry by propagating API provider environment variables to tmux-spawned processes (anthropics/claude-code#23561)
  - Fixed sandbox "operation not permitted" errors when writing temporary files on macOS by using the correct per-user temp directory (anthropics/claude-code#21654)
