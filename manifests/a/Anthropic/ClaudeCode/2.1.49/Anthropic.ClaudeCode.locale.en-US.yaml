ShortDescription: Unleash Claude’s raw power directly in your terminal. Search million-line codebases instantly. Turn hours-long workflows into a single command. Your tools. Your workflow. Your codebase, evolving at thought speed.
Description: |-
  Claude Code is Anthropic’s agentic coding tool that lives in your terminal and helps you turn ideas into code faster than ever before.
  What Claude Code does for you
  - Build features from descriptions: Tell Claude what you want to build in plain English. It will make a plan, write the code, and ensure it works.
  - Debug and fix issues: Describe a bug or paste an error message. Claude Code will analyze your codebase, identify the problem, and implement a fix.
  - Navigate any codebase: Ask anything about your team’s codebase, and get a thoughtful answer back. Claude Code maintains awareness of your entire project structure, can find up-to-date information from the web, and with MCP can pull from external datasources like Google Drive, Figma, and Slack.
  - Automate tedious tasks: Fix fiddly lint issues, resolve merge conflicts, and write release notes. Do all this in a single command from your developer machines, or automatically in CI.
  Why developers love Claude Code
  - Works in your terminal: Not another chat window. Not another IDE. Claude Code meets you where you already work, with the tools you already love.
  - Takes action: Claude Code can directly edit files, run commands, and create commits. Need more? MCP lets Claude read your design docs in Google Drive, update your tickets in Jira, or use your custom developer tooling.
  - Unix philosophy: Claude Code is composable and scriptable. tail -f app.log | claude -p "Slack me if you see any anomalies appear in this log stream" works. Your CI can run claude -p "If there are new text strings, translate them into French and raise a PR for @lang-fr-team to review".
  - Enterprise-ready: Use Anthropic’s API, or host on AWS or GCP. Enterprise-grade security, privacy, and compliance is built-in.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Added --worktree (-w) flag to start Claude in an isolated git worktree
  - Subagents support isolation: "worktree" for working in a temporary git worktree
  - Added Ctrl+F keybinding to kill background agents (two-press confirmation)
  - Agent definitions support background: true to always run as a background task
  - Plugins can ship settings.json for default configuration
  - Fixed file-not-found errors to suggest corrected paths when the model drops the repo folder
  - Fixed Ctrl+C and ESC being silently ignored when background agents are running and the main thread is idle. Pressing twice within 3 seconds now kills all background agents.
  - Fixed prompt suggestion cache regression that reduced cache hit rates.
  - Fixed plugin enable and plugin disable to auto-detect the correct scope when --scope is not specified, instead of always defaulting to user scope
  - Simple mode (CLAUDE_CODE_SIMPLE) now includes the file edit tool in addition to the Bash tool, allowing direct file editing in simple mode.
  - Permission suggestions are now populated when safety checks trigger an ask response, enabling SDK consumers to display permission options
  - Sonnet 4.5 with 1M context is being removed from the Max plan in favor of our frontier Sonnet 4.6 model, which now has 1M context. Please switch in /model.
  - Fixed verbose mode not updating thinking block display when toggled via /config — memo comparators now correctly detect verbose changes
  - Fixed unbounded WASM memory growth during long sessions by periodically resetting the tree-sitter parser
  - Fixed potential rendering issues caused by stale yoga layout references
  - Improved performance in non-interactive mode (-p) by skipping unnecessary API calls during startup
  - Improved performance by caching authentication failures for HTTP and SSE MCP servers, avoiding repeated connection attempts to servers requiring auth
  - Fixed unbounded memory growth during long-running sessions caused by Yoga WASM linear memory never shrinking
  - SDK model info now includes supportsEffort, supportedEffortLevels, and supportsAdaptiveThinking fields so consumers can discover model capabilities.
  - Added ConfigChange hook event that fires when configuration files change during a session, enabling enterprise security auditing and optional blocking of settings changes.
  - Improved startup performance by caching MCP auth failures to avoid redundant connection attempts
  - Improved startup performance by reducing HTTP calls for analytics token counting
  - Improved startup performance by batching MCP tool token counting into a single API call
  - Fixed disableAllHooks setting to respect managed settings hierarchy — non-managed settings can no longer disable managed hooks set by policy (#26637)
  - Fixed --resume session picker showing raw XML tags for sessions that start with commands like /clear. Now correctly falls through to the session ID fallback.
  - Improved permission prompts for path safety and working directory blocks to show the reason for the restriction instead of a bare prompt with no context
