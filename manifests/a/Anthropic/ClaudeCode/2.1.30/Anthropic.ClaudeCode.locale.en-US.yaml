ShortDescription: Unleash Claude’s raw power directly in your terminal. Search million-line codebases instantly. Turn hours-long workflows into a single command. Your tools. Your workflow. Your codebase, evolving at thought speed.
Description: |-
  Claude Code is Anthropic’s agentic coding tool that lives in your terminal and helps you turn ideas into code faster than ever before.
  What Claude Code does for you
  - Build features from descriptions: Tell Claude what you want to build in plain English. It will make a plan, write the code, and ensure it works.
  - Debug and fix issues: Describe a bug or paste an error message. Claude Code will analyze your codebase, identify the problem, and implement a fix.
  - Navigate any codebase: Ask anything about your team’s codebase, and get a thoughtful answer back. Claude Code maintains awareness of your entire project structure, can find up-to-date information from the web, and with MCP can pull from external datasources like Google Drive, Figma, and Slack.
  - Automate tedious tasks: Fix fiddly lint issues, resolve merge conflicts, and write release notes. Do all this in a single command from your developer machines, or automatically in CI.
  Why developers love Claude Code
  - Works in your terminal: Not another chat window. Not another IDE. Claude Code meets you where you already work, with the tools you already love.
  - Takes action: Claude Code can directly edit files, run commands, and create commits. Need more? MCP lets Claude read your design docs in Google Drive, update your tickets in Jira, or use your custom developer tooling.
  - Unix philosophy: Claude Code is composable and scriptable. tail -f app.log | claude -p "Slack me if you see any anomalies appear in this log stream" works. Your CI can run claude -p "If there are new text strings, translate them into French and raise a PR for @lang-fr-team to review".
  - Enterprise-ready: Use Anthropic’s API, or host on AWS or GCP. Enterprise-grade security, privacy, and compliance is built-in.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Added pages parameter to the Read tool for PDFs, allowing specific page ranges to be read (e.g., pages: "1-5"). Large PDFs (>10 pages) now return a lightweight reference when @ mentioned instead of being inlined into context.
  - Added pre-configured OAuth client credentials for MCP servers that don't support Dynamic Client Registration (e.g., Slack). Use --client-id and --client-secret with claude mcp add.
  - Added /debug for Claude to help troubleshoot the current session
  - Added support for additional git log and git show flags in read-only mode (e.g., --topo-order, --cherry-pick, --format, --raw)
  - Added token count, tool uses, and duration metrics to Task tool results
  - Added reduced motion mode to the config
  - Fixed phantom "(no content)" text blocks appearing in API conversation history, reducing token waste and potential model confusion
  - Fixed prompt cache not correctly invalidating when tool descriptions or input schemas changed, only when tool names changed
  - Fixed 400 errors that could occur after running /login when the conversation contained thinking blocks
  - Fixed a hang when resuming sessions with corrupted transcript files containing parentUuid cycles
  - Fixed rate limit message showing incorrect "/upgrade" suggestion for Max 20x users when extra-usage is unavailable
  - Fixed permission dialogs stealing focus while actively typing
  - Fixed subagents not being able to access SDK-provided MCP tools because they were not synced to the shared application state
  - Fixed a regression where Windows users with a .bashrc file could not run bash commands
  - Improved memory usage for --resume (68% reduction for users with many sessions) by replacing the session index with lightweight stat-based loading and progressive enrichment
  - Improved TaskStop tool to display the stopped command/task description in the result line instead of a generic "Task stopped" message
  - Changed /model to execute immediately instead of being queued
  - [VSCode] Added multiline input support to the "Other" text input in question dialogs (use Shift+Enter for new lines)
  - [VSCode] Fixed duplicate sessions appearing in the session list when starting a new conversation
