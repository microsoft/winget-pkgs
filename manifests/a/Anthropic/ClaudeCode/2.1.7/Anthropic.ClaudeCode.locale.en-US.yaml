ShortDescription: Unleash Claude’s raw power directly in your terminal. Search million-line codebases instantly. Turn hours-long workflows into a single command. Your tools. Your workflow. Your codebase, evolving at thought speed.
Description: |-
  Claude Code is Anthropic’s agentic coding tool that lives in your terminal and helps you turn ideas into code faster than ever before.
  What Claude Code does for you
  - Build features from descriptions: Tell Claude what you want to build in plain English. It will make a plan, write the code, and ensure it works.
  - Debug and fix issues: Describe a bug or paste an error message. Claude Code will analyze your codebase, identify the problem, and implement a fix.
  - Navigate any codebase: Ask anything about your team’s codebase, and get a thoughtful answer back. Claude Code maintains awareness of your entire project structure, can find up-to-date information from the web, and with MCP can pull from external datasources like Google Drive, Figma, and Slack.
  - Automate tedious tasks: Fix fiddly lint issues, resolve merge conflicts, and write release notes. Do all this in a single command from your developer machines, or automatically in CI.
  Why developers love Claude Code
  - Works in your terminal: Not another chat window. Not another IDE. Claude Code meets you where you already work, with the tools you already love.
  - Takes action: Claude Code can directly edit files, run commands, and create commits. Need more? MCP lets Claude read your design docs in Google Drive, update your tickets in Jira, or use your custom developer tooling.
  - Unix philosophy: Claude Code is composable and scriptable. tail -f app.log | claude -p "Slack me if you see any anomalies appear in this log stream" works. Your CI can run claude -p "If there are new text strings, translate them into French and raise a PR for @lang-fr-team to review".
  - Enterprise-ready: Use Anthropic’s API, or host on AWS or GCP. Enterprise-grade security, privacy, and compliance is built-in.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Added showTurnDuration setting to hide turn duration messages (e.g., "Cooked for 1m 6s")
  - Added ability to provide feedback when accepting permission prompts
  - Added inline display of agent's final response in task notifications, making it easier to see results without reading the full transcript file
  - Fixed security vulnerability where wildcard permission rules could match compound commands containing shell operators
  - Fixed false "file modified" errors on Windows when cloud sync tools, antivirus scanners, or Git touch file timestamps without changing content
  - Fixed orphaned tool_result errors when sibling tools fail during streaming execution
  - Fixed context window blocking limit being calculated using the full context window instead of the effective context window (which reserves space for max output tokens)
  - Fixed spinner briefly flashing when running local slash commands like /model or /theme
  - Fixed terminal title animation jitter by using fixed-width braille characters
  - Fixed plugins with git submodules not being fully initialized when installed
  - Fixed bash commands failing on Windows when temp directory paths contained characters like t or n that were misinterpreted as escape sequences
  - Improved typing responsiveness by reducing memory allocation overhead in terminal rendering
  - Enabled MCP tool search auto mode by default for all users. When MCP tool descriptions exceed 10% of the context window, they are automatically deferred and discovered via the MCPSearch tool instead of being loaded upfront. This reduces context usage for users with many MCP tools configured. Users can disable this by adding MCPSearch to disallowedTools in their settings.
  - Changed OAuth and API Console URLs from console.anthropic.com to platform.claude.com
  - [VSCode] Fixed claudeProcessWrapper setting passing the wrapper path instead of the Claude binary path
