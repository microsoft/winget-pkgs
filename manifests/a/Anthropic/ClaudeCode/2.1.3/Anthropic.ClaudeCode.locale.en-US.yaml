ShortDescription: Unleash Claude’s raw power directly in your terminal. Search million-line codebases instantly. Turn hours-long workflows into a single command. Your tools. Your workflow. Your codebase, evolving at thought speed.
Description: |-
  Claude Code is Anthropic’s agentic coding tool that lives in your terminal and helps you turn ideas into code faster than ever before.
  What Claude Code does for you
  - Build features from descriptions: Tell Claude what you want to build in plain English. It will make a plan, write the code, and ensure it works.
  - Debug and fix issues: Describe a bug or paste an error message. Claude Code will analyze your codebase, identify the problem, and implement a fix.
  - Navigate any codebase: Ask anything about your team’s codebase, and get a thoughtful answer back. Claude Code maintains awareness of your entire project structure, can find up-to-date information from the web, and with MCP can pull from external datasources like Google Drive, Figma, and Slack.
  - Automate tedious tasks: Fix fiddly lint issues, resolve merge conflicts, and write release notes. Do all this in a single command from your developer machines, or automatically in CI.
  Why developers love Claude Code
  - Works in your terminal: Not another chat window. Not another IDE. Claude Code meets you where you already work, with the tools you already love.
  - Takes action: Claude Code can directly edit files, run commands, and create commits. Need more? MCP lets Claude read your design docs in Google Drive, update your tickets in Jira, or use your custom developer tooling.
  - Unix philosophy: Claude Code is composable and scriptable. tail -f app.log | claude -p "Slack me if you see any anomalies appear in this log stream" works. Your CI can run claude -p "If there are new text strings, translate them into French and raise a PR for @lang-fr-team to review".
  - Enterprise-ready: Use Anthropic’s API, or host on AWS or GCP. Enterprise-grade security, privacy, and compliance is built-in.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Merged slash commands and skills, simplifying the mental model with no change in behavior
  - Added release channel (stable or latest) toggle to /config
  - Added detection and warnings for unreachable permission rules, with warnings in /doctor and after saving rules that include the source of each rule and actionable fix guidance
  - Fixed plan files persisting across /clear commands, now ensuring a fresh plan file is used after clearing a conversation
  - Fixed false skill duplicate detection on filesystems with large inodes (e.g., ExFAT) by using 64-bit precision for inode values
  - Fixed mismatch between background task count in status bar and items shown in tasks dialog
  - Fixed sub-agents using the wrong model during conversation compaction
  - Fixed web search in sub-agents using incorrect model
  - Fixed trust dialog acceptance when running from the home directory not enabling trust-requiring features like hooks during the session
  - Improved terminal rendering stability by preventing uncontrolled writes from corrupting cursor state
  - Improved slash command suggestion readability by truncating long descriptions to 2 lines
  - Changed tool hook execution timeout from 60 seconds to 10 minutes
  - [VSCode] Added clickable destination selector for permission requests, allowing you to choose where settings are saved (this project, all projects, shared with team, or session only)
