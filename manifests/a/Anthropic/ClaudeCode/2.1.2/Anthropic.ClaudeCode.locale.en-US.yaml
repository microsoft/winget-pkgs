ShortDescription: Unleash Claude’s raw power directly in your terminal. Search million-line codebases instantly. Turn hours-long workflows into a single command. Your tools. Your workflow. Your codebase, evolving at thought speed.
Description: |-
  Claude Code is Anthropic’s agentic coding tool that lives in your terminal and helps you turn ideas into code faster than ever before.
  What Claude Code does for you
  - Build features from descriptions: Tell Claude what you want to build in plain English. It will make a plan, write the code, and ensure it works.
  - Debug and fix issues: Describe a bug or paste an error message. Claude Code will analyze your codebase, identify the problem, and implement a fix.
  - Navigate any codebase: Ask anything about your team’s codebase, and get a thoughtful answer back. Claude Code maintains awareness of your entire project structure, can find up-to-date information from the web, and with MCP can pull from external datasources like Google Drive, Figma, and Slack.
  - Automate tedious tasks: Fix fiddly lint issues, resolve merge conflicts, and write release notes. Do all this in a single command from your developer machines, or automatically in CI.
  Why developers love Claude Code
  - Works in your terminal: Not another chat window. Not another IDE. Claude Code meets you where you already work, with the tools you already love.
  - Takes action: Claude Code can directly edit files, run commands, and create commits. Need more? MCP lets Claude read your design docs in Google Drive, update your tickets in Jira, or use your custom developer tooling.
  - Unix philosophy: Claude Code is composable and scriptable. tail -f app.log | claude -p "Slack me if you see any anomalies appear in this log stream" works. Your CI can run claude -p "If there are new text strings, translate them into French and raise a PR for @lang-fr-team to review".
  - Enterprise-ready: Use Anthropic’s API, or host on AWS or GCP. Enterprise-grade security, privacy, and compliance is built-in.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Added source path metadata to images dragged onto the terminal, helping Claude understand where images originated
  - Added clickable hyperlinks for file paths in tool output in terminals that support OSC 8 (like iTerm)
  - Added support for Windows Package Manager (winget) installations with automatic detection and update instructions
  - Added Shift+Tab keyboard shortcut in plan mode to quickly select "auto-accept edits" option
  - Added FORCE_AUTOUPDATE_PLUGINS environment variable to allow plugin autoupdate even when the main auto-updater is disabled
  - Added agent_type to SessionStart hook input, populated if --agent is specified
  - Fixed a command injection vulnerability in bash command processing where malformed input could execute arbitrary commands
  - Fixed a memory leak where tree-sitter parse trees were not being freed, causing WASM memory to grow unbounded over long sessions
  - Fixed binary files (images, PDFs, etc.) being accidentally included in memory when using @include directives in CLAUDE.md files
  - Fixed updates incorrectly claiming another installation is in progress
  - Fixed crash when socket files exist in watched directories (defense-in-depth for EOPNOTSUPP errors)
  - Fixed remote session URL and teleport being broken when using /tasks command
  - Fixed MCP tool names being exposed in analytics events by sanitizing user-specific server configurations
  - Improved Option-as-Meta hint on macOS to show terminal-specific instructions for native CSIu terminals like iTerm2, Kitty, and WezTerm
  - Improved error message when pasting images over SSH to suggest using scp instead of the unhelpful clipboard shortcut hint
  - Improved permission explainer to not flag routine dev workflows (git fetch/rebase, npm install, tests, PRs) as medium risk
  - Changed large bash command outputs to be saved to disk instead of truncated, allowing Claude to read the full content
  - Changed large tool outputs to be persisted to disk instead of truncated, providing full output access via file references
  - Changed /plugins installed tab to unify plugins and MCPs with scope-based grouping
  - Deprecated Windows managed settings path C:\ProgramData\ClaudeCode\managed-settings.json - administrators should migrate to C:\Program Files\ClaudeCode\managed-settings.json
  - [SDK] Changed minimum zod peer dependency to ^4.0.0
  - [VSCode] Fixed usage display not updating after manual compact
