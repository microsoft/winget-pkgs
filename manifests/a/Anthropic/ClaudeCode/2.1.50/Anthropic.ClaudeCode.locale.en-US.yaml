ShortDescription: Unleash Claude’s raw power directly in your terminal. Search million-line codebases instantly. Turn hours-long workflows into a single command. Your tools. Your workflow. Your codebase, evolving at thought speed.
Description: |-
  Claude Code is Anthropic’s agentic coding tool that lives in your terminal and helps you turn ideas into code faster than ever before.
  What Claude Code does for you
  - Build features from descriptions: Tell Claude what you want to build in plain English. It will make a plan, write the code, and ensure it works.
  - Debug and fix issues: Describe a bug or paste an error message. Claude Code will analyze your codebase, identify the problem, and implement a fix.
  - Navigate any codebase: Ask anything about your team’s codebase, and get a thoughtful answer back. Claude Code maintains awareness of your entire project structure, can find up-to-date information from the web, and with MCP can pull from external datasources like Google Drive, Figma, and Slack.
  - Automate tedious tasks: Fix fiddly lint issues, resolve merge conflicts, and write release notes. Do all this in a single command from your developer machines, or automatically in CI.
  Why developers love Claude Code
  - Works in your terminal: Not another chat window. Not another IDE. Claude Code meets you where you already work, with the tools you already love.
  - Takes action: Claude Code can directly edit files, run commands, and create commits. Need more? MCP lets Claude read your design docs in Google Drive, update your tickets in Jira, or use your custom developer tooling.
  - Unix philosophy: Claude Code is composable and scriptable. tail -f app.log | claude -p "Slack me if you see any anomalies appear in this log stream" works. Your CI can run claude -p "If there are new text strings, translate them into French and raise a PR for @lang-fr-team to review".
  - Enterprise-ready: Use Anthropic’s API, or host on AWS or GCP. Enterprise-grade security, privacy, and compliance is built-in.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Added support for startupTimeout configuration for LSP servers
  - Added WorktreeCreate and WorktreeRemove hook events, enabling custom VCS setup and teardown when agent worktree isolation creates or removes worktrees.
  - Fixed a bug where resumed sessions could be invisible when the working directory involved symlinks, because the session storage path was resolved at different times during startup. Also fixed session data loss on SSH disconnect by flushing session data before hooks and analytics in the graceful shutdown sequence.
  - Linux: Fixed native modules not loading on systems with glibc older than 2.30 (e.g., RHEL 8)
  - Fixed memory leak in agent teams where completed teammate tasks were never garbage collected from session state
  - Fixed CLAUDE_CODE_SIMPLE to fully strip down skills, session memory, custom agents, and CLAUDE.md token counting
  - Fixed /mcp reconnect freezing the CLI when given a server name that doesn't exist
  - Fixed memory leak where completed task state objects were never removed from AppState
  - Added support for isolation: worktree in agent definitions, allowing agents to declaratively run in isolated git worktrees.
  - CLAUDE_CODE_SIMPLE mode now also disables MCP tools, attachments, hooks, and CLAUDE.md file loading for a fully minimal experience.
  - Fixed bug where MCP tools were not discovered when tool search is enabled and a prompt is passed in as a launch argument
  - Improved memory usage during long sessions by clearing internal caches after compaction
  - Added claude agents CLI command to list all configured agents
  - Improved memory usage during long sessions by clearing large tool results after they have been processed
  - Fixed a memory leak where LSP diagnostic data was never cleaned up after delivery, causing unbounded memory growth in long sessions
  - Fixed a memory leak where completed task output was not freed from memory, reducing memory usage in long sessions with many tasks
  - Improved startup performance for headless mode (-p flag) by deferring Yoga WASM and UI component imports
  - Fixed prompt suggestion cache regression that reduced cache hit rates
  - Fixed unbounded memory growth in long sessions by capping file history snapshots
  - Added CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_1M_CONTEXT environment variable to disable 1M context window support
  - Opus 4.6 (fast mode) now includes the full 1M context window
  - VSCode: Added /extra-usage command support in VS Code sessions
  - Fixed memory leak where TaskOutput retained recent lines after cleanup
  - Fixed memory leak in CircularBuffer where cleared items were retained in the backing array
  - Fixed memory leak in shell command execution where ChildProcess and AbortController references were retained after cleanup
