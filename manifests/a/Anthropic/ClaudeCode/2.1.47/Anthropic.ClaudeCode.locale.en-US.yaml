ShortDescription: Unleash Claude’s raw power directly in your terminal. Search million-line codebases instantly. Turn hours-long workflows into a single command. Your tools. Your workflow. Your codebase, evolving at thought speed.
Description: |-
  Claude Code is Anthropic’s agentic coding tool that lives in your terminal and helps you turn ideas into code faster than ever before.
  What Claude Code does for you
  - Build features from descriptions: Tell Claude what you want to build in plain English. It will make a plan, write the code, and ensure it works.
  - Debug and fix issues: Describe a bug or paste an error message. Claude Code will analyze your codebase, identify the problem, and implement a fix.
  - Navigate any codebase: Ask anything about your team’s codebase, and get a thoughtful answer back. Claude Code maintains awareness of your entire project structure, can find up-to-date information from the web, and with MCP can pull from external datasources like Google Drive, Figma, and Slack.
  - Automate tedious tasks: Fix fiddly lint issues, resolve merge conflicts, and write release notes. Do all this in a single command from your developer machines, or automatically in CI.
  Why developers love Claude Code
  - Works in your terminal: Not another chat window. Not another IDE. Claude Code meets you where you already work, with the tools you already love.
  - Takes action: Claude Code can directly edit files, run commands, and create commits. Need more? MCP lets Claude read your design docs in Google Drive, update your tickets in Jira, or use your custom developer tooling.
  - Unix philosophy: Claude Code is composable and scriptable. tail -f app.log | claude -p "Slack me if you see any anomalies appear in this log stream" works. Your CI can run claude -p "If there are new text strings, translate them into French and raise a PR for @lang-fr-team to review".
  - Enterprise-ready: Use Anthropic’s API, or host on AWS or GCP. Enterprise-grade security, privacy, and compliance is built-in.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Fixed FileWriteTool line counting to preserve intentional trailing blank lines instead of stripping them with trimEnd().
  - Fixed Windows terminal rendering bugs caused by os.EOL (\r\n) in display code — line counts now show correct values instead of always showing 1 on Windows.
  - Improved VS Code plan preview: auto-updates as Claude iterates, enables commenting only when the plan is ready for review, and keeps the preview open when rejecting so Claude can revise.
  - Fixed a bug where bold and colored text in markdown output could shift to the wrong characters on Windows due to \r\n line endings.
  - Fixed compaction failing when conversation contains many PDF documents by stripping document blocks alongside images before sending to the compaction API (anthropics/claude-code#26188)
  - Improved memory usage in long-running sessions by releasing API stream buffers, agent context, and skill state after use
  - Improved startup performance by deferring SessionStart hook execution, reducing time-to-interactive by ~500ms.
  - Fixed an issue where bash tool output was silently discarded on Windows when using MSYS2 or Cygwin shells.
  - Improved performance of @ file mentions - file suggestions now appear faster by pre-warming the index on startup and using session-based caching with background refresh.
  - Improved memory usage by trimming agent task message history after tasks complete
  - Improved memory usage during long agent sessions by eliminating O(n²) message accumulation in progress updates
  - Fixed the bash permission classifier to validate that returned match descriptions correspond to actual input rules, preventing hallucinated descriptions from incorrectly granting permissions
  - Fixed user-defined agents only loading one file on NFS/FUSE filesystems that report zero inodes (anthropics/claude-code#26044)
  - Fixed plugin agent skills silently failing to load when referenced by bare name instead of fully-qualified plugin name (anthropics/claude-code#25834)
  - Search patterns in collapsed tool results are now displayed in quotes for clarity
  - Windows: Fixed CWD tracking temp files never being cleaned up, causing them to accumulate indefinitely (anthropics/claude-code#17600)
  - Use ctrl+f to kill all background agents instead of double-pressing ESC. Background agents now continue running when you press ESC to cancel the main thread, giving you more control over agent lifecycle.
  - Fixed API 400 errors ("thinking blocks cannot be modified") that occurred in sessions with concurrent agents, caused by interleaved streaming content blocks preventing proper message merging.
  - Simplified teammate navigation to use only Shift+Down (with wrapping) instead of both Shift+Up and Shift+Down.
  - Fixed an issue where a single file write/edit error would abort all other parallel file write/edit operations. Independent file mutations now complete even when a sibling fails.
  - Added last_assistant_message field to Stop and SubagentStop hook inputs, providing the final assistant response text so hooks can access it without parsing transcript files.
  - Fixed custom session titles set via /rename being lost after resuming a conversation (anthropics/claude-code#23610)
  - Fixed collapsed read/search hint text overflowing on narrow terminals by truncating from the start.
  - Fixed an issue where bash commands with backslash-newline continuation lines (e.g., long commands split across multiple lines with \) would produce spurious empty arguments, potentially breaking command execution.
  - Fixed built-in slash commands (/help, /model, /compact, etc.) being hidden from the autocomplete dropdown when many user skills are installed (anthropics/claude-code#22020)
  - Fixed MCP servers not appearing in the MCP Management Dialog after deferred loading
  - Fixed session name persisting in status bar after /clear command (anthropics/claude-code#26082)
  - Fixed crash when a skill's name or description in SKILL.md frontmatter is a bare number (e.g., name: 3000) — the value is now properly coerced to a string (anthropics/claude-code#25837)
  - Fixed /resume silently dropping sessions when the first message exceeds 16KB or uses array-format content (anthropics/claude-code#25721)
  - Added chat:newline keybinding action for configurable multi-line input (anthropics/claude-code#26075)
  - Added added_dirs to the statusline JSON workspace section, exposing directories added via /add-dir to external scripts (anthropics/claude-code#26096)
  - Fixed claude doctor misclassifying mise and asdf-managed installations as native installs (anthropics/claude-code#26033)
  - Fixed zsh heredoc failing with "read-only file system" error in sandboxed commands (anthropics/claude-code#25990)
  - Fixed agent progress indicator showing inflated tool use count (anthropics/claude-code#26023)
  - Fixed image pasting not working on WSL2 systems where Windows copies images as BMP format (anthropics/claude-code#25935)
  - Fixed background agent results returning raw transcript data instead of the agent's final answer (anthropics/claude-code#26012)
  - Fixed Warp terminal incorrectly prompting for Shift+Enter setup when it supports it natively (anthropics/claude-code#25957)
  - Fixed CJK wide characters causing misaligned timestamps and layout elements in the TUI (anthropics/claude-code#26084)
  - Fixed custom agent model field in .claude/agents/*.md being ignored when spawning team teammates (anthropics/claude-code#26064)
  - Fixed plan mode being lost after context compaction, causing the model to switch from planning to implementation mode (anthropics/claude-code#26061)
  - Fixed alwaysThinkingEnabled: true in settings.json not enabling thinking mode on Bedrock and Vertex providers (anthropics/claude-code#26074)
  - Fixed tool_decision OTel telemetry event not being emitted in headless/SDK mode (anthropics/claude-code#26059)
  - Fixed session name being lost after context compaction — renamed sessions now preserve their custom title through compaction (anthropics/claude-code#26121)
  - Increased initial session count in resume picker from 10 to 50 for faster session discovery (anthropics/claude-code#26123)
  - Windows: fixed worktree session matching when drive letter casing differs (anthropics/claude-code#26123)
  - Fixed /resume <session-id> failing to find sessions whose first message exceeds 16KB (anthropics/claude-code#25920)
  - Fixed "Always allow" on multiline bash commands creating invalid permission patterns that corrupt settings (anthropics/claude-code#25909)
  - Fixed React crash (error #31) when a skill's argument-hint in SKILL.md frontmatter uses YAML sequence syntax (e.g., [topic: foo | bar]) — the value is now properly coerced to a string (anthropics/claude-code#25826)
  - Fixed crash when using /fork on sessions that used web search — null entries in search results from transcript deserialization are now handled gracefully (anthropics/claude-code#25811)
  - Fixed read-only git commands triggering FSEvents file watcher loops on macOS by adding --no-optional-locks flag (anthropics/claude-code#25750)
  - Fixed custom agents and skills not being discovered when running from a git worktree — project-level .claude/agents/ and .claude/skills/ from the main repository are now included (anthropics/claude-code#25816)
  - Fixed non-interactive subcommands like claude doctor and claude plugin validate being blocked inside nested Claude sessions (anthropics/claude-code#25803)
  - Windows: Fixed the same CLAUDE.md file being loaded twice when drive letter casing differs between paths (anthropics/claude-code#25756)
  - Fixed inline code spans in markdown being incorrectly parsed as bash commands (anthropics/claude-code#25792)
  - Fixed teammate spinners not respecting custom spinnerVerbs from settings (anthropics/claude-code#25748)
  - Fixed shell commands permanently failing after a command deletes its own working directory (anthropics/claude-code#26136)
  - Fixed hooks (PreToolUse, PostToolUse) silently failing to execute on Windows by using Git Bash instead of cmd.exe (anthropics/claude-code#25981)
  - Fixed LSP findReferences and other location-based operations returning results from gitignored files (e.g., node_modules/, venv/) (anthropics/claude-code#26051)
  - Moved config backup files from home directory root to ~/.claude/backups/ to reduce home directory clutter (anthropics/claude-code#26130)
  - Fixed sessions with large first prompts (>16KB) disappearing from the /resume list (anthropics/claude-code#26140)
