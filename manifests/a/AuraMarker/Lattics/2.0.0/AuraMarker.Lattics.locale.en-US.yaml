ReleaseNotes: |-
  This is a major update. From now,  Lattics supports WebDAV third-party synchronization. WebDAV is the most widely used network storage protocol. Many cloud service providers support it, and you can also build your own WebDAV service, which has better data privacy and security.

  In order to better protect your data privacy, Lattics offered third party sync will also be encrypted end-to-end. Only through the Lattics' client and logging into the corresponding account, you can view the data content. The third-party server cannot decode or scan the data.

  ******【NOTICE】Before using third-party sync for the first time, please be sure to back up local files to avoid accidents **********
  **************************************************************************************************************************************

  After configuring third-party synchronization, the following data will be automatically synchronized:
  Projects, Project outlines, Articles, Cards, Pictures, Tables, Tags, Graphes, Flash cards, Dictionary, imported PDFs, Bibliolography, CSL templates, created Style Templates, Table Templates, Font, Font size, Interface Languages, Interface Theme, commonly used fonts, colors, font sizes, background colors, underlines, code languages, etc., covering all data and preference infor, maximizing the convenience of the writing

  This version also optimizes the German interface language, by Gina Bronner-Martin for proofreading and corrections, thanks to Gina
