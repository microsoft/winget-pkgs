ReleaseNotes: |-
  This another minor update similar to 2120.1 which aims to address some additional issues from the 2120 release.
  It also implements a couple of minor improvements which were appropriate to include in this release.
  Azahar 2120.2 Changelog
  All
  - After performing system file setup with the Azahar Artic Setup Tool, the virtual 3DS is now linked to the real 3DS which was used, and must be unlinked via the settings before setup is performed with a different console | @PabloMK7 #833
  - Added several checks which verify that the country selected in the emulator settings matches up with the emulated region and the region of the console used to set up system files | @PabloMK7 #847
  - Fixed a fatal error which could occur when playing games which do not have the same region as the emulated region while having LLE modules enabled | @PabloMK7 #806
  - Fixed a memory leak which would be triggered when the virtual 3DS reads files | @SeppNel #750
  Android
  - Fixed an issue where audio output was unintentionally linked to the Audio Input setting, and the Audio Input setting did not work | @toksn #844
  - Added Texture Sampling configuration option from the Qt frontend | @rtiangha #603
  Technical
  - Updated installed Linux filenames to use reverse TLD format | @OpenSauce04 #840
    - To 99.9% of users this change will mean absolutely nothing, and is primarily a change in preparation for the Flatpak release
