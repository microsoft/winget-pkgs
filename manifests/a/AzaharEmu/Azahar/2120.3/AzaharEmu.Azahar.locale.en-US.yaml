ReleaseNotes: |-
  This is a minor update which irons out some final issues from our initial release.
  If all goes to plan, this should be the last 2120.x release.
  Thank you for your patience during our initial launch period.
  We hope you look forward to the next major release, 2121.
  You can see some of the improvements we've got in the pipeline for that release here.
  Azahar 2120.3 Changelog
  Android
  - Added a new prompt for users who may have inadvertently selected a different user directory after upgrading from Lime3DS, making it seem that data such as saves may have been lost. | @DavidRGriswold #917
    - This new prompt allows users to choose between continuing to use their new user directory or restoring their old one.
    - Needing to reselect the user directory after the upgrade was not intentional and was the result of a bug.
      - We apologize if you were affected by this issue and thought you had lost data.
  All
  - Fixed an issue where Korean, Chinese and Taiwanese 3DS systems would be unable to start any application that used the system font due to the missing open source font replacement (this included the system setup tool). | @PabloMK7 #920
    - For now, the EUR/USA/JPN font will be used, but most glyphs will be replaced with question marks.
    - This allows the setup process to be completed, albeit without being able to read the text.
    - A font with the missing glyphs may be added at a later date.
  - Fixed an issue where consoles which have had their regions modified via custom firmware would be unable to start the system setup process via the Azahar Artic Setup Tool. | @PabloMK7 @luigoalma #921
  Desktop
  - Updated bundled SDL2 version to fix an issue where Xbox controllers would need to be re-paired every time they were turned off. | @OpenSauce04 9500859
  - The Azahar application now explicitly sets its own window icon. | @OpenSauce04 #892
    - For most platforms this shouldn't change anything, but on Linux it is known to fix some app icon issues.
  Technical
  - Fixed compilation failing when attempting to build using Qt 6.9.0 or later. | @OpenSauce04 #898
  - Fixed compilation failing when attempting to build for desktop with Discord support enabled while using CMake 4.0 or later. | @OpenSauce04 4b5b4a2
  - Disabled MSVC warnings C4711 and C5045 to make compilation logs less obnoxious to look at. | @OpenSauce04 #893
    - Neither of these warnings are important.
  - The version of NSIS we use to build our Windows installers has been bumped from 3.10 to 3.11.
