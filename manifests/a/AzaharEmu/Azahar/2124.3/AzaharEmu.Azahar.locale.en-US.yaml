ReleaseNotes: |-
  This update re-enables support for the .3ds extension, which was previously removed in Azahar's initial release.
  We previously made this change as a clear motion to distance ourselves from the mass piracy that lead to the closure of Yuzu and Citra, however, we have now determined that this change is causing more harm than good.
  We've noticed that the removal of the .3ds extension has caused unnecessary fragmentation in the 3DS emulation community. This led to the creation of dubiously safe forks, to which a portion of the Azahar userbase migrated. These forks used unsafe deployment practices, presented licensing concerns, and confused users as to whether the forks were part of the upstream Azahar project. These circumstances created an unhealthy open-source development environment, and we don't believe that this is in the best interest of the 3DS emulation scene.
  Given that the removal of the .3ds extension was originally an act of project philosophy rather than a technical change, we don't want this decision to overshadow the very real leaps which have been made in Azahar over the last year. Because of this, we have decided that it's for the best of everyone that we revert the change.
  It is important to note that support for encrypted ROMs is still disabled; This will not change for the foreseeable future. Unlike the .3ds extension, which is a matter of project philosophy, encrypted ROMs still present actual legal challenges that we do not want to take on.
  We have decided to publish this change in its own Azahar release to avoid the change overshadowing additions made in the future 2125 update.
  We hope that this change will help to bring the 3DS emulation community closer together.
