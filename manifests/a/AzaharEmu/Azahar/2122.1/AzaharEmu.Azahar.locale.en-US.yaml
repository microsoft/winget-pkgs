ReleaseNotes: |-
  This is a minor release for the 2122.x branch which implements several fixes and improvements.
  Azahar 2122.1 Changelog
  Android
  - Fixed a long-standing issue where LTO would fail to enable during compilation | @PabloMK7 #1151
    - Having LTO enabled allows the compiler to perform additional optimizations during compilation, resulting in a minor improvement to performance.
    - This change increases the minimum CMake version for the Android build to 3.25.
  - Fixed hotkeys bound to a button which causes the drawer to be opened triggering both the hotkey action and the opening of the drawer. | @kleidiss #1122
    - An example of a button which would have previously caused this issue would be the Circle button on a Playstation controller, or the B button on an Xbox controller.
  - Improved the layout of the initial setup process when in landscape orientation | @kleidiss #1123
  All
  - Fixed an issue where installation of a decrypted CIA could fail if encrypted content from an older Citra version | @PabloMK7 #1152
  - Increased the size of the uniform buffer where it was previously too small | @PabloMK7 #1174
    - This change improves performance for all applications, most prominently on Android devices when using the Vulkan renderer.
  - Added a new "SWP" value to the advanced frametime information display which indicates the time spent in Renderer::SwapBuffers. | @PabloMK7 #1173
  Technical
  - Fixed an issue where building for Android would fail when using CMake 4.0 or later | @OpenSauce04 #1169
