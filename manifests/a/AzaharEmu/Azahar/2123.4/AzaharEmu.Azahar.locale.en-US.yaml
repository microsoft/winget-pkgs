ReleaseNotes: |-
  Azahar 2123.4 is an unscheduled minor release which primarily targets several critical issues which were discovered since the last release, some of which were caused by upstream changes.
  All users are advised to update to this release at their earliest convenience.
  Please read the change log for further details.
  Work continues on the 2124 major release, and you can track its progress here.
  New download options:
  Android
  - The Android build has been split into two new download options, those being the vanilla and googleplay builds.
    - The vanilla version uses a new method of filesystem access which is significantly faster and more simple, but isn't permitted by the Google Play store due to its use of the MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission.
      - This new system is in its infancy, and is mostly the same as the googleplay variant, so the performance improvements won't yet be apparent. Filesystem performance should noticeably improve in the next few major releases as more functionality is migrated to the new system.
    - The googleplay version is compliant with Google Play Store regulations, and uses the old SAF-based method. This build will not see the performance improvements present in the vanilla build.
    - Unless you have a particular reason to use the googleplay build or you are downloading the app from the Google Play Store, the vanilla version is recommended.
  Linux
  - The AppImage build has been split into two new download options, those being azahar.AppImage and azahar-wayland.AppImage
    - The default azahar.AppImage now has native Wayland support disabled, instead opting to use XWayland when run in a Wayland session. This is due to some severe upstream issues that have been discovered when using native Wayland with Azahar (e.g. #1191)
    - Users are advised to use the default AppImage unless they have a specific reason to have native Wayland support enabled, for example if they are running a system with no xwayland support.
