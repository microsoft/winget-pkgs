  Azahar 2123.1 Changelog
  All
  - Fixed a bug introduced in Azahar 2120 where, if an attempted installation of a .cia file failed, the save data of the associated game would be deleted. | @PabloMK7 #1319
    - The logic flaw which allowed this to happen had been present in Citra for many years, but it was only able start to causing damage due to a seemingly innocuous adjustment which was made in Azahar's initial release.
