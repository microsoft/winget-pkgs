  Azahar 2123 Changelog
  All
  - Added ROM compression functionality. | @PabloMK7 #1208 #1249
    - Support for the following new formats have been added: .zcia, .zcci, .z3dsx, .zcxi.
    - ROMs can be compressed in Azahar using Tools --> Compress ROM File… on desktop.
  - Fixed a memory leak in the AAC decoder. | @QidiWang #1167
  - Fixed an issue where display refresh rates below ~60hz would cause emulation speed to be slower than intended when vsync was enabled. | @OpenSauce04 #1193, @kylon #1248
  - Different 3DS applications now have separate Vulkan pipeline caches. | @PabloMK7 #1118
    - Previously, all Vulkan pipeline caches were stored in a single large file which was shared between all 3DS applications.
  - Fixed LCD colour fill functionality. | @PabloMK7 #1198
    - Before being fixed, this could cause applications which fill the screen with a certain colour to be black or display garbage.
  - When using the OpenGL renderer, if a shader fails to link, the emulator will now experience graphical anomalies and produce logs rather than crashing. | @PabloMK7 #1200
  - Fixed some dead links left over from Citra. | @RedBlackAka #1250
  Android
  - Implemented secondary screen support for wired and wireless displays (Chromecast, Miracast). | @DavidRGriswold #617
    - By default, this functionality is disabled, and must be enabled by setting Settings --> Layout --> Secondary Display Screen Layout to an option other that System Default (mirror).
  - Added button sliding behaviour configuration to the Overlay Options menu. | @toksn #884
  - Implemented play time tracking. | Kleidis, @rtiangha #813
  - Restructured touch input code to correctly handle multitouch inputs, resulting in improved multitouch support for the on-screen controller overlay. | @OpenSauce04 #1296
  MacOS
  - Fixed an issue where the Artic Controller feature wouldn't work correctly on MacOS. | @AlexMolina08 #1263
  - Fixed an issue where, on recent MacOS versions, enabling the OS’s low power mode would result in many games being limited to 50% emulation speed when vsync was enabled. | @OpenSauce04 #1193 #1262
  - Added individual x86_64 and ARM64 binaries to releases alongside the existing universal download | @RedBlackAka #1138
  Desktop
  - Fixed horizontal centering being incorrect when using the single window or separate window layouts while fullscreened. | @DavidRGriswold #1211
  - When using a prerelease build, users are now directed to download the update from the Azahar GitHub releases page rather than the Azahar website. | @OpenSauce04 #1295
    - The Azahar website doesn't list prereleases, so this may have caused some confusion with users. This could have resulted in users unintentionally downgrading to the latest stable release.
    - This doesn't affect stable releases such as this one, but it will affect all future prereleases.
  Windows
  - Minor adjustments to the Windows installer. | @RedBlackAka #1234
  Technical
  - Set correct stop flag in GSP. | @kynex7510 #1199
  - Fix irq request register behaviour. | @PabloMK7 #1216
    - This change and the previous one were noted to not affect 3DS applications at all in theory, instead being more of a correctness thing.
  - Fixed compilation failing when building using GCC 13 or earlier. | @OpenSauce04 #1221
  - Fixed a build error when using the USE_SYSTEM_GLSLANG CMake option. | @OpenSauce04 #1281, #1284
  - Added a new CMake option USE_SYSTEM_SPIRV_HEADERS. | @OpenSauce04 #1281, #1284
  - Removed use of deprecated boost class and moved to a functionally identical alternative. | @qr243vbi #1126
  - Upgraded Vulkan-related dependencies to match Vulkan SDK 14.313.0. | @OpenSauce04 #1225
  - Fixed the SDL frontend failing to compile due to the use of a removed function. | @OpenSauce04 #1190
    - The SDL frontend still doesn’t work properly, and remains disabled by default at compile time.
  - Various minor changes to the Azahar installer on Windows.
  - Amended CMakeLists to help certain environments to find required Qt dependencies. | @qr243vbi #1165
  - Upgraded Android Gradle Plugin to 8.11.1 | @OpenSauce04 #1256
