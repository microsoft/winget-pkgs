  Azahar 2123.2 Changelog
  Android
  - Fixed an issue where games may not close properly, and upon attempting to open a different game, the emulator would become stuck. | @DavidRGriswold #1357
  - Fixed an issue where, upon attempting to edit a slider option with an out-of-bounds value, the emulator would crash. | @DavidRGriswold #1340
  - Added native support for Android devices with 16kb memory pages. | @OpenSauce04 #1351
  - Fixed an issue where the Logcat output would be spammed by log messages related to an abandoned BufferQueue. | @OpenSauce04 #1355
  MacOS
  - Fixed an issue where compilation would fail when using Xcode 26. | @OpenSauce04 #1338
  - Fixed an issue where Qt widgets could appear corrupted when building using Xcode 26. | @OpenSauce04 #1352
  - Updated to Qt 6.9.2. | @OpenSauce04 #1338
  All
  - Fixed an issue where, if the shaders/vulkan/ directory was manually deleted, the emulator would fail to recreate it properly, resulting in the emulator crashing due to failure to write cache data. | @OpenSauce04 #1373
    - Users who encountered this issue will stop experiencing crashes after updating.
  Windows
  - Updated to Qt 6.9.2. | @OpenSauce04 #1338
  Technical
  - Fixed an issue where CMake configuration could fail if a bundled dependency was attempted to be used while the system also had a version of that dependency installed. | @OpenSauce04 #1342 #1377
    - This was only ever observed on MacOS, but if it did exist on other platforms, this change will also fix those.
  - Added a check for the required minimum Xcode version when building on MacOS. | @OpenSauce04 #1346
    - Notably, this minimum doesn't align with our minimum MacOS version for running Azahar: When running Azahar, MacOS 13 Ventura is required, but when building Azahar, MacOS 14 Sonoma's Xcode 15 is required.
