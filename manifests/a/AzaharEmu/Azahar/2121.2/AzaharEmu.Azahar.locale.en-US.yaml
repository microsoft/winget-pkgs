ReleaseNotes: |-
  This is a minor update for the 2121.x branch which implements some minor improvements and fixes.
  Azahar 2121.2 Changelog
  All
  - Added a setting which allows the RPC server to be toggled on and off. | @PabloMK7 #1047
    - It was previously always on and is now disabled by default.
  - Fixed an issue where the emulation framerate could become locked to the refresh rate of the monitor when emulation speed was set to unthrottled while using the Vulkan renderer. | @OpenSauce04 #1035
  Android
  - Fixed an issue introduced in Android 15 where emulation content would appear under the camera notch. | @OpenSauce04 #1069
    - This fix will stop working in an unspecified future Android version. The property which fixes this issue was added in Android 15, but was then immediately deprecated in Android 16. A follow-up fix will be added down the line which addresses the issue in future Android versions.
  - Fixed messages relating to the Turbo feature sometimes appearing in situations when the setting hadn't been modified (e.g. closing the settings menu). | @OpenSauce04 #1026
  Room
  - --username option now requires an argument where it was erroneously optional before. | @Kexanone #971
    - This would result in a null pointer exception if an argument was not provided.
  MacOS
  - MoltenVK has been updated from v1.2.7-rc2 to v1.2.9. | @RedBlackAka #998
  Technical
  - Fixed a compilation error introduced in a recent MSYS2 update related to stat being used instead of _stat64. | @OpenSauce04 #1041
  - Updated the prerelease update check code to use GitHub's tags API to get the latest tag instead of the releases API. | @OpenSauce04 #1076
    - This avoids an issue where if several releases are uploaded in quick succession, the releases API may return the releases in the incorrect order, which would result in update checks either not prompting users to update or prompting users to downgrade depending on what version they were using.
  - Added alpha and beta substrings to prerelease detection logic. | @OpenSauce04 #1074
