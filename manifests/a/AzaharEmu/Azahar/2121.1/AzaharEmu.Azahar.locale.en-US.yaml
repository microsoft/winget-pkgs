ReleaseNotes: |-
  This is a hotfix for the 2121 update which primarily addresses an issue relating to save states which wasn't caught during the release candidate period. Apologies if you were affected by the issue.
  ⚠️ Save states made on versions before this update are no longer compatible. Please read below for further information.
  Azahar 2121.1 Changelog
  All
  - Fixed an issue where the emulator would crash when loading a save state while using the OpenGL renderer | @PabloMK7 #1016
    - This change breaks backwards compatibility with save states made in Azahar version 2121 or earlier.
    - Before updating to this version, please ensure that you have saved using the in-game save dialog.
      - To avoid the above issue, this should be done while using the Vulkan renderer.
    - For more information on how to appropriately use save states and avoid unexpected loss of progress, please read our blog post on the topic: https://azahar-emu.org/blog/understanding-save-states
  Desktop
  - Added a scroll bar to the Layout tab in the settings menu. | @SeppNel #1004
    - This fixes an issue where, at certain screen resolutions, the height of the settings menu would be so tall that the Ok and Cancel buttons would be off of the bottom edge of the screen, and couldn't be clicked.
