ReleaseNotes: |-
  Similarly to 2124.1, this minor release focuses on fixing high-priority bugs and issues.
  Additionally, it introduces a new "Update Channel" feature on desktop builds, allowing you to receive in-app notifications for pre-release builds such as betas and release candidates, even when running a stable release. We are releasing this feature in the hope that it will encourage more users to try the prereleases, experiencing the new features early and helping us to polish the final release by reporting issues we may have missed.
  Azahar 2124.2 Changelog
  Desktop
  - Introduced a new Update Channel feature | @OpenSauce04 #1659
    - This feature can be accessed from the General section of the settings menu under a new "Updates" subsection.
    - The available channels are "Stable" and "Prerelease".
    - When using pre-release builds, update notifications will still be received for newer pre-releases regardless of the setting value to allow important fixes to be distributed. As such, this new feature primarily applies to the stable build.
  - Added a note to the "Enable async presentation" setting indicating that it adds 1 frame of input lag. | @Immersion95 #1669
  - The Vulkan texture filtering functionality, which was introduced in 2124, has been temporarily disabled due to unforeseen stability issues. | @PabloMK7 #1678
    - This feature is planned to be re-enabled in the 2125 update following additional polishing and another round of public testing. Apologies for any inconvenience.
  MacOS
  - Fixed an issue where, when using an Application Directory, Azahar may hang or have a flickering user interface after launching. | @OpenSauce04 #1665
  All
  - Fixed an issue where plugins that were intended to run for all title IDs instead didn't run at all. | @OpenSauce04 #1679
    - This notably fixes an issue where the Nimbus plugin required to play Animal Crossing: New Leaf online failed to load properly.
  - Updated SDL to version 2.32.10. | @OpenSauce04 #1680
    - This notably fixes an issue where connecting/disconnecting a controller during emulation on macOS would cause the emulator to crash.
  - Fixed an issue where, when launching from the HOME menu, applications which required forced accurate multiplication wouldn't have it activated. | @PabloMK7 #1671
  - Fixed an issue where, when loading a save state, accurate multiplication would be automatically and erroneously disabled until emulation was restarted. | @PabloMK7 #1671
  - Fixed an issue where game graphics could momentarily appear broken after loading a save state. | @PabloMK7 #1672
  - Fixed an issue where custom textures would be disabled after loading a save state until emulation was restarted. | @PabloMK7 #1672
  - Mario & Luigi: Paper Jam now has forced accurate multiplication, improving compatibility. | @PabloMK7 #1671
  Android
  - Fixed an issue where, on many setups, the VSync setting could appear to be disabled, but was actually enabled. | @OpenSauce04 #1658
    - This was addressed by properly disabling the VSync setting in these configurations, matching the setting's prior appearance.
  - Fixed an issue where the Retroid Pocket screen attachment could function incorrectly on the Odin 2. | @DavidRGriswold #1667
  - The circle pad/c-stick binding UI has been updated to be more clearly understandable. | @DavidRGriswold #1676
  Technical
  - CMake now explicitly searches for Qt6::GuiPrivate before linking with it, improving build compatibility in certain environments. | @marcin-serwin #1657
