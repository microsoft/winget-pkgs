ReleaseNotes: |-
  This update is notable for having a high number of improvements to game performance and compatibility. Please read the change notes.
  Additionally, for x86_64 devices (most desktop computers), this update requires a CPU which has SSE4.2 instructions, and it is likely that all future releases will also have this requirement.
  This feature is available in all modern CPUs released in 2011 or later.
  The few users who have hardware which doesn't support this instruction set can compile the emulator from source with the ENABLE_SSE42 CMake option disabled.
  Azahar 2122 Changelog
  All
  - SIMD operations have been used to optimize a commonly used function, reducing GPU processing time for all applications. | @PabloMK7 #1086
    - This change breaks compatibility with x86_64 CPUs which don't have SSE4.2 instructions (primarily CPUs released before 2011).
    - The few users who have hardware which doesn't support this instruction set can compile the emulator from source with the ENABLE_SSE42 CMake option disabled.
      - Disabling this CMake option also disables the optimization to the commonly used function.
  - Improved SVC handling timings by simulating the passage of time more accurately. | @PabloMK7 #1093
    - This results in significant performance improvements for several games, including but not limited to Luigi's Mansion 2, Star Fox 64 3D, and The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth.
  - Refactored state tracking in the video core, reducing the amount of needed syncs and uploads to the GPU. | @PabloMK7, anonymous contributor #1059
    - This improves performance in all applications.
  - Allow SPIR-V when using Shadow2D texture mapping. | @PabloMK7, anonymous contributor #1057
    - This greatly reduces stuttering in some games. Games known to be affected by this include Luigi's Mansion 2 and Resident Evil: Revelations, but other games may also see improvements.
  - GLSL -> SPIRV optimizations have been disabled by default, with a new setting added to re-enable them. | @PabloMK7 #1080, #1084
    - Disabling these optimizations has minimal impact on performance while greatly improving stuttering in all applications.
  - Fixed the start index parameter for the geometry shader config being set incorrectly. | @PabloMK7, anonymous contributor #1056
    - This fixes an issue in Kid Icarus: Uprising where grind rails would appear to be invisible.
  - Replaced a problematic assert in AccelerateTextureCopy with a logged error. | @PabloMK7 #1092
    - This fixes an issue which caused The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth to immediately crash when starting a run.
  MacOS
  - Fixed an issue where certain entries would disappear from the native menubar while using certain non-English languages. | @RedBlackAka #1111
    - Due to this change, the native menubar, which was disabled in 2121, has been re-enabled.
  Android
  - Additional options have been added during shortcut creation, allowing the icon and name of the shortcut to be customized. | Kleidis #824
  - The performance overlay has been enhanced with new settings and statistics available to be toggled from the Layout settings. | Kleidis #808
    - By default, only the current FPS is shown. Other statistics can be toggled on in the aforementioned settings menu.
  - Added an aspect ratio setting which affects the single-screen layout. | @icy-briar #913
  - Fixed a regression introduced in the 2122 prereleases where the Accurate Multiplication setting was tied to the value of the Asynchronous Shader Compilation setting. | @OpenSauce04 #1142
  - Added an option which allows disabling JIT shader compilation. | @PabloMK7 #1085
  - Reorganized the setup process to reduce the unnecessarily high number of pages. | Kleidis, @OpenSauce04 #820
  - Added rotate screen upright toggle. | Kleidis #819
  - Fixed an issue where Azahar would consistently crash on opening if it lost permission to access to the user data directory. | @PabloMK7 #1110
  Desktop
  - Added an option which allows advanced frame time information to be displayed at the bottom of the window. | @PabloMK7 #1083
  - Fixed an issue where a custom-set background colour wouldn't be used while using the Vulkan renderer when an application was initially booted. | @icy-briar #896
  - Fixed an issue where the RPC server setting wouldn't save and would consequently always be disabled when restarting Azahar. | @PabloMK7 #1129
  - Adjusted the name of the Show Log Console setting to no longer incorrectly state that it is "Windows Only" | @OpenSauce04 #1133
  Room
  - Private room hosts are now automatically given moderator privileges. | Kleidis #822
  - The --enable_citra_mods option has been removed. | Kleidis #822
  Technical
  - Refactored Android switch setting code to only store values as booleans. | Kleidis #821
  - Updated some outdated Vulkan dependencies on Windows (MSVC) and Android to match the Vulkan SDK 1.4.304.1 used elsewhere. | @OpenSauce04 #1094
  - Vulkan::CreateSurface now reports an error code if an error occurs. | @PabloMK7 #1130
  - Addressed several deprecation warnings flagged by Android Studio. | @OpenSauce04
  - Suppressed redundant GCC ABI warnings produced by -Wpsabi. | @OpenSauce04 #1089
