ReleaseNotes: |-
  WinPaletter is back!
  This return release concentrates on cleaning up legacy issues and providing a better-honed experience. While significant new features are not anticipated, the goal is to place the project in a stable, workable condition.
  Warning
  You might encounter bugs, as this version is a beta and not a final, stable release. Please be patient and report any issues so I can fix them. I aim to make WinPaletter as stable and bug-free as possible.
  Important
  If you are using a language file, some strings may not appear translated because the core language support has changed significantly. Please wait for the translators to update the language files accordingly.
  Important
  Development during this comeback phase will be limited. The developer will be available only one or two days per week (or every two weeks), and not for the full day. As a result, progress will be slower compared to the more active development period prior to archiving.
  New features:
  1. System restore points
  - Windows System Restore Points are snapshots of your system files and settings at a specific moment in time. They allow you to revert your system back to a previous, stable state if something goes wrong—without affecting your personal files. This feature is especially useful before making system-level changes, like installing drivers, updates, or customization tools.
  - WinPaletter supports the creation of System Restore Points directly from within the app. Before applying any visual changes, you can create a restore point to ensure you have a safety net in case you need to undo the modifications. WinPaletter makes this process easy and integrated, helping you protect your system while you customize its appearance.
  Important
  Keep in mind that each restore point can take up around 100–300 MB of disk space, or even more. Frequently applying themes and creating restore points may consume significant storage over time. If your system is stable, consider reviewing and deleting older restore points to free up space. Always keep an eye on your system partition's free space to avoid running into performance or update issues.
  - You can also take a system restorepoint before applying a single aspect, by doing this:

  2. New aspect: Accessibility
  It consists of High Contrast (was formerly in Classic Colors) and Color Filters (was formely in Windows Effects)
  3. Logging system:
  WinPaletter Log for diagnostics. It is accessible in main form toolbar.

  Application improvement:
  1. User Profiles Switching:
  - Switching to a user profile protected by a password now uses the Windows Security (Credentials) dialog for better security, instead of WinPaletter's own password prompt.
  image
  - Opening WinPaletter will no longer show a list of users; it will directly target the user who launched WinPaletter (mimicking Windows 10/11 login behavior). If you want to switch to another user in the current session, do so from the main form. (This method slightly improves startup speed, but you likely won’t notice the difference.)
  - The option to continue without a password has been removed to avoid conflicts between two users (the target user and the user who opened WinPaletter).
  2. Other improvements:
  - The .NET Framework dependency has been upgraded from version 4.7.2 to 4.8, which is now required (not a problem to any user.)
  - The "What's New" form has been removed (the GitHub releases page is a better alternative).
  - Bug and crash report system redesigned, now includes the ability to save theme files.
  - Added "Plus! 95 For Kids" CD schemes for classic colors, metrics, and fonts.
  - Rescue tools renamed to SOS, with command line options: WinPaletter -f or WinPaletter --SOS.
  - SOS mode will automatically activate when WinPaletter is opened in safe mode.
  - When you download a theme from WinPaletter store, there is a check list of aspects will be edited. In this dialog, a button called "Proceed with all selected" is removed and replaced by two buttons "Check all" and "Uncheck all" to eliminate ambiguity.

  - Improved default Windows themes; now all aspects will be restored correctly.
  - Significant speed improvements in languages and the Language Editor.
  - Startup speed has been slightly optimized.
  - WinPaletter Store massive speed improvements.
  - The "Save as theme" feature now recommends a filename based on the theme name instead of an empty string.
  - Minor memory usage optimizations.
  - Help button is placed into tab context menu
  - UI minor refresh
  Bugs fixes:
  - Fixed store items not being downloaded and listed.
  - Fixed an issue where pressing "Apply" in the Lighthouse at sunset theme store and then returning to the Windows previewer in the store caused an exception error.
  - Fixed an issue where the store previewer did not show the wallpaper of a downloaded theme pack the first time in the current session, but displayed it correctly on subsequent attempts.
  - Fixed an issue where the taskbar and Start menu showed a clipped, blurred portion of a different wallpaper if the theme had a wallpaper different from the current one.
  - Skipping listing the WsiAccount user as it is part of system users.
  - Closing the theme applying process form when Explorer is already killed now correctly restores Explorer.
  - The Windows Effects alert dialog is now brought to the top. Previously, it was hidden behind the applying form, causing confusion that the applying process was not working.
  - Fixed the magnifier with high DPI settings not centering correctly on the cursor position in classic colors.
  - Fixed an issue where applying Classic Colors reset the cursors.
  - Fixed icon label preview by correcting the shadow algorithm.
  - Fixed exception errors when deleting store cache and logs in Settings > Storage Details.
  - Fixed store classic colors preview that had incorrect fore colors.
  - Fixed: closing Icons studio with drives tab selected threw an exception error.
