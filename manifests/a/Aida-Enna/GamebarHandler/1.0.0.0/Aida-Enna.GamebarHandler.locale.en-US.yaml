ShortDescription: Gets rid of those pesky 'open ms-gamebar' and 'open ms-gamingoverlay' popups.
Description: Gets rid of those pesky 'open ms-gamebar' and 'open ms-gamingoverlay' popups. When you don't have the gamebar and Xbox gaming overlay installed, Windows still tries to call them do to various things (for some reason?). By running this program, you tell Windows "Hey, this program can handle those!". So then when Windows wants to open the gamebar or gaming overlay, it opens this program, which instantly (and silently!) closes. \ o /
