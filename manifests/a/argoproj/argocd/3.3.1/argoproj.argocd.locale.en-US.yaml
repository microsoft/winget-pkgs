  Important
  Before upgrading all types of Argo CD installations to this release, please read the upgrade guide first:
  https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/upgrading/3.2-3.3/#breaking-changes
  Upgrading Argo CD which is managing itself
  Users who have an Argo CD Application that manages their Argo CD installation, must enable ServerSideApply=true sync option on this Application in order for the upgrade to succeed.
  In some cases, like when the self-managing of Argo CD is performed with Kustomize, there may be a sync error like Failed to perform client-side apply migration: failed to perform client-side apply migration on manager kubectl-client-side-apply.
  We are currently working on a long-term fix to this issue, the progress can be tracked here: #26279
  A temporary remediation is to additionally set the ClientSideApplyMigration=false sync option on this Application. This solution is temporary and not recommended for the long run because it may result in conflicts between Argo CD K8s field manager and other field managers at a later point in time, and if you use it, you will need to remove it after the above issue is fixed.
  More details here:
  https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/sync-options/#client-side-apply-migration
