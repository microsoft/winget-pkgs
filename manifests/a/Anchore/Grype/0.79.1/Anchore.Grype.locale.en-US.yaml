  Updates
  - update CI to install golang at the latest version [#1949 @spiffcs]
  - Grype is now built with the latest version of Golang at v1.22.x. This resolves a few security findings that would have been flagged against the v0.79.0 binary for using an older version of the Golang standard library.
