ShortDescription: A powerful, lightning fast and censorship resistant proxy.
Description: |-
  Hysteria is a powerful, lightning fast and censorship resistant proxy.
  üõ†Ô∏è Jack of all trades
  Wide range of modes including SOCKS5, HTTP Proxy, TCP/UDP Forwarding, Linux TProxy, TUN - with more features being added constantly.
  ‚ö° Blazing fast
  Powered by a customized QUIC protocol, Hysteria is designed to deliver unparalleled performance over unreliable and lossy networks.
  ‚úä Censorship resistant
  The protocol masquerades as standard HTTP/3 traffic, making it very difficult for censors to detect and block without widespread collateral damage.
  üíª Cross-platform
  We have builds for every major platform and architecture. Deploy anywhere & use everywhere. Not to mention the long list of 3rd party apps.
  üîó Easy integration
  With built-in support for custom authentication, traffic statistics & access control, Hysteria is easy to integrate into your infrastructure.
  ü§ó Chill and supportive
  We have well-documented specifications and code for developers to contribute and/or build their own apps. And a helpful community, too.
