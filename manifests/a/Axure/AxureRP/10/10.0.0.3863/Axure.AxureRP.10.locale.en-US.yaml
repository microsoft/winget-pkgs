  Feature Updates
  Enhanced Duplicate: You can now duplicate widgets with consistent spacing.
  - Widgets can be duplicated using [CTRL]/[CMD] + [D] or [CTRL]/[OPT] + Drag Selection.
  - When duplicating a widget, RP will remember the distance you moved the duplicate  widget from the original. Any subsequent duplications after that will place the  selected widget the same distance until the widget is deselected.
  - If you’re editing text during subsequent duplications, you will remain in text edit   mode.

  Bug Fixes & Performance Enhancements
  - Fixed Libraries pane moving with mouse after adding widgets while it is undocked on   Windows
  - Fixed duplicate image folders preventing all libraries from loading in RP
  - Fixed errors when scrolling through or dragging from an updated widget library as it  refreshes
  - Fixed errors tabbing between component override fields in the Interactions pane
  - Fixed errors when switching widget fills between solid and gradient
  - Fixed error pasting a selection including a locked dynamic panel with widget notes
  - Fixed preserve corners distorting images when applied to widgets on MacOS 11 or 12
  - Fixed connectors breaking when moving them outside of a dynamic panel
  - Fixed connectors reflowing incorrectly when converting them into a dynamic panel
