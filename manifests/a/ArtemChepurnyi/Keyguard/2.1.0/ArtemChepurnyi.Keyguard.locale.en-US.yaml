ReleaseNotes: |-
  This update introduces initial support for creating new password credentials on Android via Android Credential framework.
  [!NOTE]
  A large part of the release is testing the updated new release pipeline that maintains the release log for Flathub. The updated pipeline should provide users with a list of versions and the changelog summary for each of them. The summary is auto-generated by an LLM from full changelog as a part of the release pipeline. I hope to extend it at some point to other stores that support displaying changelogs.
  I've also turned on GitHub's immutable releases.
