ReleaseNotes: |-
  This update introduces a new feature allowing you to tap an application's URI to look it up in the Google Play, F-Droid, or Apple App stores, which now also fetches app icons. An issue on Android has been fixed where cancelling an autofill prompt could cause the service to stop working. For desktop users, the Windows and macOS apps now use the system's native certificate store for improved connectivity. This release also includes several minor performance and user interface enhancements.
