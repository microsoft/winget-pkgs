ReleaseNotes: |-
  This release introduces functional and user interface updates for Windows. The trust manager has been consolidated to combine the Windows-My, Windows-ROOT, and default certificate stores. On Windows, the main window title will now dynamically change to match the selected application theme. A bug has also been fixed where blank tags were incorrectly being saved with vault ciphers.
  [!NOTE]
  I've finally updated the Android release pipeline to automatically push the release to production track on release. No longer needed for me to manually promote this day's nightly internal build to production, yay! As a bonus, we now get the release summary attached to the Play store release 🍻
