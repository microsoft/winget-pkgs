ShortDescription: Secure access to enterprise and cloud-based resources.
Description: |-
  Appgate SDP provides users with secure access to enterprise and cloud-based resources. Please note: Before this app can be used, your company will have sent you the required Client profile link to use.
  Once implemented, Appgate SDP dynamically creates a secure, encrypted “segment of one” which is dynamically-generated and tailored for each user session. Access criteria precisely controls which resources each user can access based on multiple variables, such as the user’s device, location, time of day and operating system revision. Appgate SDP also integrates with your existing business systems to create truly dynamic access rules.
  For everyone else, the network resources are invisible and completely inaccessible, dramatically reducing the attack surface of typical flat corporate networks. Appgate SDP even cloaks itself, hiding the system from prying eyes.
  Appgate SDP is built like the cloud – massively scalable, distributed and resilient. It implements the Software-Defined Perimeter architecture, allowing organizations to adopt a Zero-Trust security model for mobile and desktop users, across on-premises, hybrid, and cloud environments.
