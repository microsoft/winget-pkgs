ReleaseNotes: |-
  • Regular Expression search added. To perform a regex search, type in a forward slash followed immediately by the regex, e.g.:
    /[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]\.csv$
    If the regex contains spaces, enclose it in double quotes, like this:
    /"[0-9]{4} [0-9]{2} [0-9]\.csv$"
  • Support for DrivePool, Storage Spaces and other similar "virtual" drives added (WizFile would crash or stop working when scanning these types of drive before)
  • Fixed highlighted text display bug that could occur with certain searches
  • Wildcard search for file extensions was not working correctly when "match entire path" option was used - fixed
    e.g. searching for *.c would include files including ".c" anywhere in the file name, which would include *.cpp or *.c.bak files too.
  • minor interface tweaks
  • New Czech translation added (thanks to DrTactless)
