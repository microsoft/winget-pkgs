ReleaseNotes: |-
 • "Today" file search filter (=today) was not working correctly in some time zones - fixed
 • Command line parameters for /filter and /filterexclude now support literal double quotes. This is useful when filtering paths containing spaces, to prevent the filter from treating the space as an "AND" operator.
   Use a single quote character to represent the double quote, like this:
   WizTree64.exe /filter="'C:\Program Files\'|'C:\Program Files (x86)\'"
   The example above would set the "include filter" to
   "C:\Program Files\"|"C:\Program Files (x86)\"
   The filter above will match file names containing "C:\Program Files\" OR "C:\Program Files (x86)\"

   Two single quotes in a row will be treated as one literal single quote:
   WizTree64.exe /filter="'C:\Program Files\'|'C:\Program Files (x86)\'|'C:\Bob''s Folder\'"
   This would set the "include filter" to
   "C:\Program Files\"|"C:\Program Files (x86)"|"C:\Bob's Folder\"

   Without the quotes the filtering will not work as expected:
   C:\Program Files\|C:\Program Files (x86)\
   This would match any file names containing "C:\Program" AND ( "Files\" OR "C:\Program" ) AND "Files" AND "(x86)\"

   Previously the way to work around this problem was to replace the spaces with wildcard question marks, like this:
   WizTree64.exe /filter="C:\Program?Files\|C:\Program?Files?(x86)\"
 • WizTree 4.09/4.10 would crash when run as "SYSTEM" user ("NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM") due to some issues with the newly added drag/drop functionality - fixed
 • Fixed some cosmetic issues with Italian translation
