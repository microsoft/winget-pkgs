ReleaseNotes: "• \"Today\" file search filter (=today) was not working correctly in some time zones - fixed\n• Command line parameters for /filter and /filterexclude now support literal double quotes. This is useful when filtering paths containing spaces, to prevent the filter from treating the space as an \"AND\" operator.\n  Use a single quote character to represent the double quote, like this:\n  WizTree64.exe /filter=\"'C:\\Program Files\\'|'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\'\"\n  The example above would set the \"include filter\" to\n  \"C:\\Program Files\\\"|\"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\\"\n  The filter above will match file names containing \"C:\\Program Files\\\" OR \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\\"\n\n  Two single quotes in a row will be treated as one literal single quote:\n  WizTree64.exe /filter=\"'C:\\Program Files\\'|'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\'|'C:\\Bob''s Folder\\'\"\n  This would set the \"include filter\" to\n  \"C:\\Program Files\\\"|\"C:\\Program Files (x86)\"|\"C:\\Bob's Folder\\\"\n\n  Without the quotes the filtering will not work as expected:\n  C:\\Program Files\\|C:\\Program Files (x86)\\\n  This would match any file names containing \"C:\\Program\" AND ( \"Files\\\" OR \"C:\\Program\" ) AND \"Files\" AND \"(x86)\\\"\n\n  Previously the way to work around this problem was to replace the spaces with wildcard question marks, like this:\n  WizTree64.exe /filter=\"C:\\Program?Files\\|C:\\Program?Files?(x86)\\\"\n• WizTree 4.09/4.10 would crash when run as \"SYSTEM\" user (\"NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM\") due to some issues with the newly added drag/drop functionality - fixed\n• Fixed some cosmetic issues with Italian translation "
