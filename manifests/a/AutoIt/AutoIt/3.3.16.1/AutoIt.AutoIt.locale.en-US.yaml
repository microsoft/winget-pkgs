ShortDescription: A freeware BASIC-like scripting language designed for automating the Windows GUI and general scripting.
Description: |-
  AutoIt v3 is a freeware BASIC-like scripting language designed for automating the Windows GUI and general scripting. It uses a combination of simulated keystrokes, mouse movement and window/control manipulation in order to automate tasks in a way not possible or reliable with other languages (e.g. VBScript and SendKeys). AutoIt is also very small, self-contained and will run on all versions of Windows out-of-the-box with no annoying "runtimes" required!
  AutoIt was initially designed for PC "roll out" situations to reliably automate and configure thousands of PCs. Over time it has become a powerful language that supports complex expressions, user functions, loops and everything else that veteran scripters would expect. Features:
  - Easy to learn BASIC-like syntax
  - Simulate keystrokes and mouse movements
  - Manipulate windows and processes
  - Interact with all standard windows controls
  - Scripts can be compiled into standalone executables
  - Create Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)
  - COM support
  - Regular expressions
  - Directly call external DLL and Windows API functions
  - Scriptable RunAs functions
  - Detailed helpfile and large community-based support forums
  - Compatible with Windows XP SP3 / 2003 SP2 / Vista / 2008 / Windows 7 / 2008 R2 / Windows 8 / 2012 R2
  - Unicode and x64 support
  - Digitally signed for peace of mind
  - Works with Windows User Account Control (UAC)
  AutoIt has been designed to be as small as possible and stand-alone with no external .dll files or registry entries required making it safe to use on Servers. Scripts can be compiled into stand-alone executables with Aut2Exe.
  Also supplied is a combined COM and DLL version of AutoIt called AutoItX that allows you to add the unique features of AutoIt to your own favorite scripting or programming languages!
