ReleaseNotes: |-
  “Shallow repos. It’s not that deep.”
  New ✨
  - Experimental Feature – Git Executable:
    - Shallow repo support is now in preview! If you have a shallowly-cloned repository, you can now open it inside of GitKraken Desktop, and most features will work as normal. If you run into any problems, please let us know!
  - GitKraken AI:
    - Explain Working Changes: Select your unstaged edits and get a clear summary of what changed and why.
  Improvements 🙌
  - Merge Conflict Improvements
    - AI conflict resolution is now synced to the exact code line so you can review and apply changes faster.
  - GitKraken AI:
    - Added support for custom OpenAI, Anthropic & Gemini endpoint URLs.
    - Added the ability to cancel the Commit Composer while the AI is still composing.
    - Added preset instruction choices to custom instructions in preferences.
  - Experimental Feature – Git Executable:
    - Bumped Bundled Git to v2.51.1.
  - Upgraded Electron to v38.
  - GitHub pull request templates now support organization-level templates.
  - Added a left-panel context menu option to checkout a tag’s commit directly.
  - Added HTML syntax highlighting for .vue files.
  - When the graph is focused, using the Select First keybind (Ctrl+Home/⌘+↑) will now select the WIP/conflict when present, instead of the most recent commit/stash.
  Bug Fixes 🐛
  - Commit/Stash message generation no longer errors with Cannot read properties of undefined (reading ‘requestIdleCallback').
  - Skip Hooks now appears when committing from Git worktrees.
  - GitHub issues using <ul> and <li> now format correctly.
  - GitHub issues with descriptions will once again display tooltips on hover.
    - Submodules
      - Fixed failure when cloning unreachable submodules that could leave repos unstable.
      - Fixed warnings in the Diff View that misattributed changes to uninitialized submodules, when the changes actually belonged to the parent repo.
  - Git notes no longer appear as commits in the graph.
  - Ambiguous branches, tags, and remotes no longer block branch deletion or cause other issues in the graph.
  - Prefetch and other non-standard branches are no longer displayed in the graph.
  - With Git Executable enabled, submodules in the left panel are now alphabetized.
  Modernization Notice 🎨
  - Custom Themes
    - As part of our UI modernization efforts, we will be sunsetting custom themes supported starting in 11.7. Light, dark, and high-contrast themes will remain available.
