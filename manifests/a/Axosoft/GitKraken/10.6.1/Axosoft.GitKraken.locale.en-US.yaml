ReleaseNotes: |-
  Improvements üôå
  - Automatic Conflict Detection:
    - If your currently checked out branch is associated with a pull request, the pull request‚Äôs target branch will be prioritized for checking conflicts.
    - You can now exclude branches when setting the base branches for a repository.
    - When resolving a detected conflict, the initial conflict that appears won‚Äôt trigger a ‚Äúfailed to merge/rebase‚Äù message, as initiating the conflict is intentional and expected.
    - Improved the clarity of the toolbar popover.
  - Added a context menu option to open a GitHub Action‚Äôs workflow runs on GitHub from the Left Panel.
  - Consolidated context menu options for creating a worktree and checking out a branch into submenus.

  Bug Fixes üêõ
  - Fixed an issue where some App Menu items did not do anything when selected.
  - Fixed an issue where closing an issue or PR from Launchpad would crash the app.
  - Dropping multiple stashes at once from the Left Panel will no longer drop the wrong stashes.
