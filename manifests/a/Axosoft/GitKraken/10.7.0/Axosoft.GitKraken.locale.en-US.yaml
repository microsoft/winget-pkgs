  New ‚ú®
  - Find your repos and branches faster! You can now search directly in the repository and branch dropdowns from the breadcrumb in the toolbar.
    - Repository search: Searching in the repository dropdown will search through all repositories in the Repository Management tab. Selecting a new repo will open it in the current tab or switch to that tab if it‚Äôs already opened.
    - Branch search: Searching in branch dropdown will search through all local branches in the repo, and selecting a branch will checkout that branch. If your repository has worktrees, they‚Äôll appear at the top of the branches list for easy access.
