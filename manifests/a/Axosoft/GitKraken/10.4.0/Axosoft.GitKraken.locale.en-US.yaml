ReleaseNotes: |-
  New ‚ú®
  - New Launchpad filters allow you to get a more focused view of your next sprint or milestone.
    - You can now see and filter by Jira fix versions and sprints in Launchpad.
    - You can now see and filter by GitHub and GitLab milestones in Launchpad.
  - Insights has moved to GitKraken.dev, offering greater control and visibility into key project metrics.
    - Clicking on the Insights icon for a Cloud Workspace in the Repo Management tab will now direct you to Insights for that Workspace on GitKraken.dev.
  - Optimize your repo on disk with the new command Perform Repo Maintenance in the Command Palette.
    - Open the Command Palette with the shortcut Cmd/Ctrl+P.
    - This command will execute git maintenance run, which may take several minutes on larger repositories.

  Improvements üôå
  - Added support for descriptions (multiple lines) in stash messages.
  - You can now invite Azure DevOps users to your GitKraken organization from the Launchpad user filter.
  - Improved performance shortly after start-up by reducing wasteful pre-loading of data.
  - First-time onboarding:
    - The dialog for opening a repository has improved to search for repositories in subfolders if the selected directory is not a repository.

  Bug Fixes üêõ
  - Fixed an issue where long repository or remote names could overlap with the next column in the Repository Management tab.
  - Fixed an issue connecting the Azure DevOps integration while signing in with Azure DevOps.
  - Commit author emails with different casing should now be treated as the same email by the author filter in the Commit Graph.
  - Fixed an issue where the commit button(s) could be pushed off the bottom of the screen in some cases.
  - Adjusted several toasts to look better in Light theme.
  - Pull Requests will now only show on graph ref labels when the remotes match, not just the branch name. This will eliminate cases where PR icons could appear on a remote which was unrelated to the PR.
  - Fixed an issue where clicking on the WIP input box would deselect the WIP.
  - Fixed an issue where interactive rebase didn‚Äôt checkout the branch being rebased.
  - Fixed an issue where the Launchpad user filter did not search by users‚Äô names in the filter dropdown.

  - Fixed a case in the Launchpad WIPS tab where opening a repository in the browser would not work.
  - The Commit Details Panel will now open when creating a Cloud Patch, even when it was previously hidden by the user.
  - Fixed cases where the Launchpad user filter would not detect a user is within an org for Azure DevOps.
  - Fixed an issue where the Launchpad summary in the status bar would show data from the Team view instead of the Personal view.
  - Experimental Feature ‚Äì Git Executable:
    - Fixed an issue where switching from a branch with submodules to a branch without them did not delete submodule folders.
    - Fixed an issue where user.signingKey in global .gitconfig was not updated when switching between GPG and SSH signing formats.
