  CrossMacro v0.8.4 - Flathub Compliance & Enhanced Stability
  This release focuses on platform compliance, input precision, and critical system stability improvements.
  Key Highlights:

  - Linux Refinements: The application can now operate independently without relying on the X11 daemon.
  - Text Expansion: Added alternative pasting methods to ensure compatibility with terminals and specific applications.
  - Core Architecture: Extensive refactoring to decouple recording, playback, and services for better maintainability.
