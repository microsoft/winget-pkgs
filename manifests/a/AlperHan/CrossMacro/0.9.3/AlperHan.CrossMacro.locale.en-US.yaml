  CrossMacro v0.9.3 - Input Reliability & Gaming Mouse Improvements
  This release focuses on improving input capture reliability and fixing critical issues with gaming peripherals and macro playback on Linux.
  Key Changes:
  - Gaming Mouse Button Detection:
    - Fixed detection for gaming mice (e.g., Razer Basilisk V3) that don't advertise BTN_LEFT in their HID capability bitmask.
    - Detection now checks for any mouse button (BTN_LEFT through BTN_TASK) instead of requiring BTN_LEFT specifically.
    - Increased capability buffer size from 64 to 96 bytes to support all Linux key codes (KEY_MAX = 767).
  - Input Event Reliability:
    - Added SYN_DROPPED handling to prevent stuck keys and incorrect button states during high system load.
    - When kernel event buffer overflows, the application now automatically resyncs all keyboard and mouse button states.
    - Ensures reliable input capture even with high polling rate gaming mice (8000Hz+).
  - Absolute Mode Cursor Fixes:
    - Fixed cursor jumping to (0,0) at the start of macro loop playback.
    - Fixed cursor position interference during keyboard and scroll events in absolute positioning mode.
