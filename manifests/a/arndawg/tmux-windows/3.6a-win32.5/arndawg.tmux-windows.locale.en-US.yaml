ShortDescription: Terminal multiplexer for Windows, ported from tmux using ConPTY
Description: |-
  A native Windows port of tmux, the terminal multiplexer. Split your terminal
  into multiple panes, create persistent sessions that survive disconnects, and
  detach/reattach workflows — all natively on Windows 10+.

  Built with ConPTY for full pseudo-terminal support and Windows Named Pipes for
  secure, kernel-enforced IPC. Works in Windows Terminal, VS Code terminal, and
  any VT-capable console host. Builds with MSVC, no Cygwin or WSL required.

  Terminal Rendering Fixes

  Fixes two visual rendering issues on Windows: the status bar rendering in
  black-and-white instead of the default green, and the status bar misaligning
  after reattach when the pane contained long lines that wrapped past the
  terminal width.

  Status Bar Color Fix:
  - Implement tparm() conditional and comparison operators in win32-compat.c
  - The setab/setaf terminfo format strings use conditionals to select between
    8-color, 16-color, and 256-color escape sequences
  - Without these operators, color output was garbled and the status bar
    rendered black-and-white instead of the default green

  Wrapped-Line Redraw Fix:
  - Disable the wrapped-line cursor optimization on Windows in tty-draw.c
  - ConPTY xenl (delayed wrap) behavior differs from Unix terminals, causing
    cursor position desync after writing to the last column
  - Forces explicit CUP positioning for every line, guaranteeing correct
    status bar alignment after reattach with wrapped content
