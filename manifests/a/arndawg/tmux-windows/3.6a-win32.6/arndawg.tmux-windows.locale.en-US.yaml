ShortDescription: Terminal multiplexer for Windows, ported from tmux using ConPTY
Description: |-
  A native Windows port of tmux, the terminal multiplexer. Split your terminal
  into multiple panes, create persistent sessions that survive disconnects, and
  detach/reattach workflows — all natively on Windows 10+.

  Built with ConPTY for full pseudo-terminal support and Windows Named Pipes for
  secure, kernel-enforced IPC. Works in Windows Terminal, VS Code terminal, and
  any VT-capable console host. Builds with MSVC, no Cygwin or WSL required.
ReleaseNotes: |-
  Single-File Static Distribution

  tmux-windows is now a single statically-linked executable with no DLL
  dependencies. Previously the release included event_core.dll (libevent);
  this is now compiled directly into tmux.exe.

  Changes:
  - Switched vcpkg triplet from x64-windows to x64-windows-static so
    libevent is linked into tmux.exe at build time
  - Release ZIP contains only tmux.exe — no DLLs, no README.txt
  - Simpler deployment: just drop tmux.exe into your PATH
