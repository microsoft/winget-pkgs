ShortDescription: Terminal multiplexer for Windows, ported from tmux using ConPTY
Description: |-
  A native Windows port of tmux, the terminal multiplexer. Split your terminal
  into multiple panes, create persistent sessions that survive disconnects, and
  detach/reattach workflows — all natively on Windows 10+.

  Built with ConPTY for full pseudo-terminal support and Windows Named Pipes for
  secure, kernel-enforced IPC. Works in Windows Terminal, VS Code terminal, and
  any VT-capable console host. Builds with MSVC, no Cygwin or WSL required.
