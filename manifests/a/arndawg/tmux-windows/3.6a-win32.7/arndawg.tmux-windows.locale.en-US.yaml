ShortDescription: Terminal multiplexer for Windows, ported from tmux using ConPTY
Description: |-
  A native Windows port of tmux, the terminal multiplexer. Split your terminal
  into multiple panes, create persistent sessions that survive disconnects, and
  detach/reattach workflows — all natively on Windows 10+.

  Built with ConPTY for full pseudo-terminal support and Windows Named Pipes for
  secure, kernel-enforced IPC. Works in Windows Terminal, VS Code terminal, and
  any VT-capable console host. Builds with MSVC, no Cygwin or WSL required.
ReleaseNotes: |-
  SSH Session Survival

  The tmux server now survives SSH disconnects. Previously, closing an SSH
  connection would terminate the tmux server and all attached sessions,
  because Windows OpenSSH uses job objects to kill all child processes when
  a session ends.

  Changes:
  - Server launch uses CREATE_BREAKAWAY_FROM_JOB to detach from the SSH
    job object, the Windows equivalent of Unix setsid()
  - Falls back to previous behavior if the job does not allow breakaway
  - Sessions started over SSH can be reattached from the local console
    or a new SSH connection
