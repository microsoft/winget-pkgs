InstallationNotes: |-
  The development team put a lot of work in to developing Avogadro 1, in September, 2021 we decided to archive the repository as it depends on a number of very old libraries.
  The team shifted their focus to Avogadro 2 several years ago, using more modern depdencies and a rewritten core under the more permissive 3-clause BSD license.
  We hope you will move to Avogadro 2 if you have not already as we work towards making the successor more widely useful to the community
