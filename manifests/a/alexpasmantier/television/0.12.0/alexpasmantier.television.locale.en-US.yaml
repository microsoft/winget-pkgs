  Highlights
  This section is meant as a quick recap of what you should know when upgrading to 0.12.0.
  It is in no means exhaustive. If you're really interested in the complete changelog, feel free to skip ahead.
  Channels refactor and lots of new features
  - channels now allow much more configuration options
  - channels are now laid out in a more natural way in the user's config directory
  - tv now relies on string-pipeline as its templating system which provides a concise and very expressive syntax that supports quite a lot of basic transformations
  - channels can be accessed directly using keyboard shortcuts (see config options above)
  - community-maintained channels on the official repo can now be installed directly via the cli
  - channels can now be live reloaded and can be configured to live reload periodically
  CLI
  Lots of new configuration options, all listed here, among which:
  - UI elements, sizes, layout (most of which are covered here)
  - channels can now be built on the fly using the cli:
  tv --source-command "find . -name '*.rs'" \
      --preview-command "bat -n --color=always '{}'" \
      --preview-size 70
  - you may now choose to disable some of tv's features for a specific use case (e.g. opening tv in single-channel mode by disabling the remote control entirely, or choosing to disable the status bar for an extra line of space, etc.)
  - you may now define custom keybindings through the cli
  - you may tweak tv's selection behavior using --select-1, --take-1, --take-1-fast
  - tv now has a --watch mode
  - you may now download channels from tv's repo using the cli
  New UI features and improvements to customization
  tv-files-remote
  - tv now has a status bar and a help panel
  - the remote control went through a rework and now displays richer information about available channels
  - tv now has a portrait mode
    image
  - the preview panel size is now configurable on a per channel basis
  - tv now has an --inline mode (+ --height, --width)
    image
  - more customizable UI elements
    image
  - preview scrollbars
  Shell integration
  - added support for nushell
  - shell integration now spawns tv in inline mode by default
  - improved shell integration for zsh and fish
  Others
  - mouse support
  - tui testing framework
  - search history (per-channel and global)
  - a lot of bug fixes
  - substantial performance improvements while drawing much less resources
  - heavy refactoring and simplifying the code (deleting nearly 10k loc)
  - a fair amount of documentation work
  - a lot of new tests
  New website
  Television now has a brand new website!
