ShortDescription: A Modern, Powerful GUI for Scoop
Description: Rscoop (rust-scoop) is the ultimate graphical user interface for the Scoop package manager on Windows. Rscoop isn't just a pretty face; it's a powerhouse of functionality designed to be a complete replacement for the command line. Its intuitive, modern UI is incredibly easy to grasp, making package management a breeze for both new and experienced users.

  Release Notes 1.4.5
  New Features
  - Native MSI Launch Fix: Rscoop now automatically detects if it was launched in a restricted MSI context (common after fresh installs) and seamlessly relaunches itself with correct permissions and working directory. The "MSI Launch Notice" screen has been removed.
  - Enhanced Manifest Viewer: The manifest viewer now features improved syntax highlighting (Atom One Dark), a copy-to-clipboard button, and a cleaner UI.
  Improvements
  - Massive Backend Refactor:
    - Non-blocking Operations: Heavy tasks like searching, status checks, and updates now run in non-blocking threads, keeping the UI responsive even during intensive operations.
    - Modular Architecture: Scheduler logic moved to a dedicated module; cleaner separation of concerns across commands.
    - Robust Junction Handling: The linker now uses multiple strategies (std fs, cmd, PowerShell) to reliably remove and create junctions, fixing issues with version switching.
  - State Management: Package info modals now automatically update their state after operations (install/uninstall/update) without needing to close and reopen.
  - Performance: Optimized file system scanning and modification time checks.
  - Packages without Buckets: Packages without buckets display normally and warn the User the bucket is missing
  - Moved View Manifest Button: Moved to the Modal itself for ease of access for power-users
  - Slight theming and consistency Improvements: To unify it better text and colors have been slightly adjusted
  Bug Fixes
  - Versioned Installs: Fixed issues where install.json was missing or unreadable for versioned package installs.
  - Bucket Manifests: Improved logic for locating and counting manifests within buckets, supporting both flat and nested structures.
  - Auto-Cleanup: Ensure auto-cleanup is reliably triggered after uninstalling packages or clearing cache.
  - Search: Fixed JSON parsing for bin fields in manifests to correctly identify binary matches.
  Next Version
  - Light Mode: Next version will include a light theme
  - Accent Colors: Selectable accent colors
