  Added
  - Settings Page Redesign: Settings are now organized into clear tabs (Automation, Management, Security, Window & UI, About) for faster navigation.

  - Start on Boot: New Startup toggle lets Rscoop launch automatically with Windows; integrates version-aware MSI mismatch handling.
  - Auto cleanup: Automatically clean up old versions and cache on install/update and uninstall

  Bug Fixes / Reliability
  - Startup Event Race: Registered cold-start and readiness listeners before any asynchronous update/network checks to prevent missed backend events causing long (10s) spinner fallback.
  - Updater Timeout Stall: Moved update check to deferred phase after readiness with a 4s timeout safeguard so a slow/failed request no longer blocks initial UI rendering.
  - Duplicate Emissions Reduced: Added is_cold_start_ready backend command to allow future polling and reduce reliance on repeated multi-attempt event emission loops.
  - Loading Screen Variability: Eliminated cases where loading screen persisted until fallback due to late listener registration; readiness now reflects actual cold-start completion promptly.
  - Resilience on Network Errors: Gracefully logs updater failures without elevating severity or holding UI readiness state.
  - Debug logs: Now rotate upon launch to not cause exhaustive debugs
