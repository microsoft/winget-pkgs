  Release Notes
  Added
  - Debug mode with floating debug button for accessing system information, logs, and troubleshooting tools (toggle in Settings).
  - New debug commands (get_debug_info, get_app_logs, read_app_log_file) for detailed system diagnostics.
  Improved
  - Drastically reduced log volume through intelligent caching and debouncing:
    - Cold-start now logs efficiently with early-break optimization (no retry spam).
    - Installed packages scan uses fingerprint-based caching with 1-second debouncing to eliminate rapid re-scans.
    - Held packages lookup includes memoization checks to prevent redundant filesystem walks.
    - Linker version enumeration uses package version cache to avoid directory walking on every call.
    - LNK shortcut parsing reduced from per-file logging to single summary line.
    - External crate logging (lnk, reqwest, tauri_plugin_updater) now gated at appropriate levels.
  - Cold-start initialization now parallel-prefetches installed packages and manifest cache without blocking delays.
  - App state refactored with encapsulated scoop_path() getter/setter and refresh-time tracking for debouncing.
  - Package versions cache architecture similar to installed packages cache, tied to installed packages fingerprint.
  - Eliminated blocking retry loops during cold-start; .msi symlink settling is handled gracefully via fallback to latest version directory.
  - Manifest cache warming during cold start ensures first search is instant without re-scanning buckets.
  - Search command now reports cache status and timing information for better observability.
  - Cold-start now completes faster by removing synchronous sleep delays that were blocking the parallel package scan.
  Documentation
  - Removed a README notice describing the known update/fresh-install bug (as its now fixed on .msi installers).
  - Comprehensive troubleshooting guide for debug information and log inspection.
