  - [Change #451] Debugger: Support address prefixes for breakpoints and Mini mem dump window:
    - bp or bpm[r|w] [s/][/][l<1|2>/][rom/]
    - Similar for m<1|2> commands.
      - Additionally inspect Mockingboard state: m<1|2> s/<mb[a|b]|ay[a|b]>
    - Extend the UI to show specifics of memory bank number & LC 4K bank 1 or 2.
