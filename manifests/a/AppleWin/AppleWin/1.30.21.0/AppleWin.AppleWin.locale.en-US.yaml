ReleaseNotes: |-
  1.30.21.0 - 31 May 2025
  Note: This is the last planned version to support Windows XP.
  - [Change #1363] Right-click Disk Drive buttons QoL features to manage new disk images.
    - Support creation of new DOS/ProDOS blank or formatted disk (including default ProDOS apps).
    - [PR #1364] Document the new UI workflows.
    - [PR #1375] Document the disk image size magic numbers.
  - [Change #1365] Update disk images included with AppleWin distro.
    - [Change #438] Remove MASTER.DSK and add BLANK.DSK (created using the newly added DOS 3.3 System Master disk).
    - Add 'DOS 3.3 System Master - 680-0210-A.dsk'.
    - Add 'ProDOS_2_4_3.po'.
  - [Change #478] Support up to 16MiB in RamWorks III card (-r 256), and default to 1MiB (eg. -aux rw3, without -r switch)
  - [Change #1397] Debugger: Monitor's memcpy: Warn and abort when the source's end address is below the source's start address.
  - [Change #1384] Debugger: Support viewing pseudo-HGR pages at all multiple-of-8K physical start addresses within the 64K main memory.
  - [Change #1341] Support Apple //e with empty aux slot, or with a 1KiB 80-column card.
    - Includes accurately supporting the video modes, eg. aux=empty and enabling 80COL, then floating bus is fetched for aux memory.
    - Currently only available via the command line: -aux <empty|std80|ext80|rw3>.
    - NB. For -aux empty, -aux std80 and -alt-cpu-emu this uses a different CPU emulation code path, where full-speed runs 25% slower.

  - [Bug #290] Fix for very slow Pascal builds on a 128K machine - using new command line: -alt-cpu-emu.
  - [PR #1352] Add SoundBuffer interface. [@Jamiras]
