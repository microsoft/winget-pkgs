ReleaseNotes: |-
  This release introduces plugins for extending Cursor, improvements to core agent capabilities like subagents, and fine-grained network controls for sandboxed commands.

  Plugins on the Cursor Marketplace
  Plugins package skills, subagents, MCP servers, hooks, and rules, into a single install. The Cursor Marketplace lets you discover and install plugins to extend Cursor with pre-built capabilities.
  Our initial partners include Amplitude, AWS, Figma, Linear, Stripe, and more. These plugins cover workflows across design, databases, payments, analytics, and deployment.

  Browse plugins at cursor.com/marketplace or install directly in the editor with /add-plugin.
  Read more in our announcement.

  Sandbox network access controls
  The sandbox now supports granular network access controls, as well as controls for access to directories and files on your local filesystem. Define exactly which domains the agent is allowed to reach while running sandboxed commands:
  - User config only: restricted to domains in your sandbox.json
  - User config with defaults: restricted to your allowlist plus Cursor's built-in defaults
  - Allow all: unrestricted network access within the sandbox

  Admins on the Enterprise plan can enforce network allowlists and denylists from the admin dashboard, ensuring organization-wide egress policies apply to all agent sandbox sessions.

  Async subagents
  Previously, all subagents ran synchronously, blocking the parent agent until they complete. Subagents can now run asynchronously, allowing the parent to continue working while subagents run in the background.
  Subagents can also spawn their own subagents, creating a tree of coordinated work. This allows Cursor to take on bigger tasks like multi-file features, large refactors, and challenging bugs.

  We've also made some performance improvements to subagents since our last release. They now run with lower latency, better streaming feedback, and more responsive parallel execution.

  Improvements (16)
  - Agents can now search past conversations and use chat history as context.
  - The Cursor CLI agent can handle the sudo password prompt inline for commands that require elevated privileges.
  - Common operations like git clone, npm install, and pip install now work out of the box in the agent sandbox. You can extend or override these defaults per-project.
  - When the agent is in Plan mode, you can now choose "Build in Cloud" to hand off plan execution to a Cloud Agent while you continue working locally or close your laptop.
  - Toggle inline diffs on or off in your settings. By default, diffs are shown only in the review panel.
  - Renamed "Duplicate Chat" to "Fork Chat" in the three-dot menu of a chat message.
  - Improved permission request flow for subagents.
  - Improved the performance of very long chats.
  - Improved the performance of @ mentions.
  - Added keyboard shortcut ⌘+Enter (Ctrl+Enter) to submit messages in agent conversations.
  - Removed the Dotfile Protection setting to remove unexpected approval prompts when the agent tried to edit dotfiles.
  - Removed Default Mode setting so each new agent conversation begins fresh.
  - Removed Auto-Accept on Commit setting so pending diffs are automatically accepted when you commit.
  - Cleaned up the More Actions chat menu.
  - Added a Close button to the agent chat pane.
  - Manual edits no longer create in-line diffs.
  Bug Fixes (7)
  - Fixed bug where some terminal tool calls caused degraded performance.
  - Fixed keybinding behavior for Cmd+Opt Left/Right for tab navigation.
  - Fixed an auto-run mode switching bug.
  - Fixed errors when creating project rules with no workspace open.
  - The global ignore list is now empty by default to fix sandboxing issues. Existing ignore patterns still work the same.
  - Stopping the parent agent will always stop the child subagents.
  - Enforce read-only sandbox for Ask mode even with "Run everything" enabled.
