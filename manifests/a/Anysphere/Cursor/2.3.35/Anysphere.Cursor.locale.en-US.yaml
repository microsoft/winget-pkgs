  Layout customization
  It's now easier to customize your default layout across workspaces.
  We've included four default layouts: agent, editor, zen, and browser. You can use Command (⌘) + Option (⌥) + Tab (⇥) to switch between layouts, or easily jump between different workspaces. Additionally, you can move backwards in this list by including Shift (⇧), similar to macOS.
