  Share terminal with Agent
  Agents can now use your native terminal. A new terminal will be created when needed and runs in the background if one isn’t already open. Click Focus to bring it up front where you can see Agent commands and also take over.

  View context usage in Chat
  At the end of a conversation you can now see how much of the context window is used.

  Agent edits are now faster by lazy loading linter errors. Search & Replace edit latency has been reduced by 25% and Apply edits by almost 11%.
