ReleaseNotes: |-
  Run Agents in Linear
  You can now start Background Agents directly from Linear. Delegate tasks to Cursor without leaving your issue. We've written a longer blog post with more details.

  Improved review flow in Agent terminal
  The terminal now opens on the left with a clear backdrop and border animation to highlight when it’s blocking. Rejecting auto-focuses the input so you can respond immediately.

  OS Notifications from Agent
  Get native OS notifications when an agent run finishes or when input is required, for example approving a command that is not allowlisted. Enable from Settings.

  Support for MCP elicitation
  Cursor now supports MCP elicitation, a new feature in the MCP spec that allows servers to request structured input from users, such as a user preference or configuration choice. Requests are defined with JSON schemas, giving servers validated responses while ensuring users stay in control of what they share.
