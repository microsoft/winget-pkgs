ReleaseNotes: |-
  Agent To-dos
  Agents now plan ahead with structured to-do lists, making long-horizon tasks easier to understand and track.
  The agent breaks down longer tasks with dependencies, visible to you in chat and streamed into Slack when relevant. It can update this list as work progresses, keeping context fresh and interactions predictable.
  To-dos are also visible in Slack if integration is setup!

  Queued messages
  You can now queue follow-up messages for Agent once it's done with current task. Just type your instructions and send. Once in queue, you can reorder tasks and start executing without waiting.

  Memories (now GA)
  Memories is now GA. Since 1.0, we've improved memory generation quality, added in-editor UI polish, and introduced user approvals for background-generated memories to preserve trust.

  PR indexing & search
  Cursor now indexes and summarizes PRs much like it does files. You can search old PRs semantically or explicitly fetch a PR, issue, commit, or branch into context.
  This includes associated GitHub comments, BugBot reviews, and Slack agent supportâ€”making postmortem analysis or incident tracing much faster.

  Improved embeddings for semantic search
  Codebase search is now much more accurate with our new embedding model. We've also re-tuned prompts to yield cleaner, more focused results.

  Faster Tab
  Tab completions are now ~100ms faster, and TTFT has been reduced by 30%. We made this possible by restructuring our memory management system and optimizing data transfer pathways.

  Let Agent resolve merge conflicts
  When merge conflicts occur, Agent can now attempt to resolve them for you. Click Resolve in Chat and relevant context will be added to resolve the conflict.

  Background Agent improvements
  Several improvements to Background Agents make them more predictable and resilient:
  - PRs follow your team's template
  - Changes to the agent branch are auto-pulled in
  - Conflicts (like rebases) are now surfaced as actionable follow-ups
  - You can commit directly from the sidebar
  - Slack and web deeplinks open the associated repo, even if you don't have it open
  Improvements (7)
  - VS Code upgraded to 1.99
  - Extensions are now hosted on Open VSC
  - Improved Slack agent responsiveness and notification clarity
  - Agent "commit changes" now available in UI
  - Background Agent respects team PR templates and merges more predictably
  - Deep performance tuning across indexing and vector services
  - VSCode remote extension connection stability improved
  Fixes (4)
  - Memory leaks in SolidJS detection system patched
  - Chat rendering bugs resolved (toolcall display, overflow issues)
  - Usage limit errors now display clearer, scoped messages
  - Token auth stability improvements across external services
