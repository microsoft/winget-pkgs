  Share terminal with Agent
  Agents can now use your native terminal. A new terminal will be created when needed and runs in the background if one isnâ€™t already open. Click Focus to bring it up front where you can see Agent commands and also take over.

  View context usage in Chat
  At the end of a conversation you can now see how much of the context window is used.
