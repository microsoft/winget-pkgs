ReleaseNotes: |-
  Cursor 1.0 is here!
  This release brings BugBot for code review, a first look at memories, one-click MCP setup, Jupyter support, and general availability of Background Agent.
  Automatic code review with BugBot
  BugBot automatically reviews your PRs and catches potential bugs and issues.
  When an issue is found, BugBot leaves a comment on your PRs in GitHub. You can click "Fix in Cursor" to move back to the editor with a pre-filled prompt to fix the issue.
  To set it up, follow instructions in our BugBot docs.

  Background Agent for everyone
  Since we released Background Agent, our remote coding agent, in early access a few weeks ago, early signals have been positive.
  We're now excited to expand Background Agent to all users! You can start using it right away by clicking the cloud icon in chat or hitting Cmd/Ctrl+E if you have privacy mode disabled. For users with privacy mode enabled, we'll soon have a way to enable it for you too!

  Agent in Jupyter Notebooks
  Cursor can now implement changes in Jupyter Notebooks!
  Agent will now create and edit multiple cells directly inside of Jupyter, a significant improvement for research and data science tasks. Only supported with Sonnet models to start.

  Memories
  With Memories, Cursor can remember facts from conversations and reference them in the future. Memories are stored per project on an individual level, and can be managed from Settings.
  We're rolling out Memories as a beta feature. To get started, enable from Settings â†’ Rules.

  MCP one-click install and OAuth support
  You can now set up MCP servers in Cursor with one click, and together with OAuth support, you can easily authenticate servers that support it.
  We've curated a short list of official MCP servers you can add to Cursor at docs.cursor.com/tools.
  If you're an MCP developer, you can easily make your server available to developers by adding a Add to Cursor button in your documentation and READMEs. Generate one at docs.cursor.com/deeplinks.

  Richer Chat responses
  Cursor can now render visualizations inside of a conversation. In particular, Mermaid diagrams and Markdown tables can now be generated and viewed in the same place!

  New Settings and Dashboard
  The setting and dashboard page have gotten some polish with this release.
  With the new Dashboard, you can view your individual or team's usage analytics, update your display name, and view detailed statistics broken down by tool or model.
