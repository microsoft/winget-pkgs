ShortDescription: The minimal way to bootstrap conda onto a system. Contains only conda and its dependencies.
Description: Miniconda is a free minimal installer for conda. It is a small bootstrap version of Anaconda that includes only conda, Python, the packages they both depend on, and a small number of other useful packages (like pip, zlib, and a few others). If you need more packages, use the conda install command to install from thousands of packages available by default in Anaconda’s public repo, or from other channels, like conda-forge or bioconda.
