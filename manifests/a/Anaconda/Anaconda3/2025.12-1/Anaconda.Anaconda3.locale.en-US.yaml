ReleaseNotes: |-
  Python version: 3.13.9

  User-facing Changes
  - Conda has been updated to v25.11.0. Please see our blog announcement for more details on other package updates and features.
  - Windows 10 version 1809 (October 2018 Update) is now the minimum supported Windows version. This is the minimum runtime requirement for Qt6, which is required for GUI packages shipped in the Anaconda Distribution installer.
  - MacOS 12.1 is now the minimum supported MacOS version.

  Bug fixes
  - Removed excessive write permissions during the installation process (CVE-2025-64343). During the installation process, the installation directory may give write permissions to authenticated users. This happens for both single-user and all-user installations. Write permissions are now hardened immediately when the installation starts.

  Known issues
  - Both Qt5 and Qt6 are included in this release: Qt6 supports Navigator 2.7.0 and most GUI packages, while Qt5 remains for Spyder 6.1.0 compatibility. This duplication will no longer be required in future releases when Spyder has migrated to Qt6.
  - When closing Navigator, users may see a Qt-related error message in the terminal. This does not affect Navigator functionality.
  - Amazon Linux 2 compatibility issue: Anaconda 2025.12 and compiled packages in the main channel built after September 2025 require glibc 2.28 or later. Amazon Linux 2 (which uses glibc 2.26) is not supported.
    - Recommended migration path: Upgrade to Amazon Linux 2023 or Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.
    - Note: Amazon Linux 2 reaches AWS end-of-support in June 2026.
