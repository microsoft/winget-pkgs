  User-facing Changes
  - Conda has been updated to v25.5.1.
  - The EULA of the installer has been updated.
  - New conda plugins added:
    - anaconda-auth: An authentication library for Anaconda services allowing users to log into anaconda.com and providing Anaconda Business users more streamlined access to PSM Cloud. NOTE: anaconda-auth replaces conda-token.
    - conda-anaconda-tos: This plugin prompts users to accept or reject the Anaconda Terms of Service when updated terms are available.
    - conda-anaconda-telemetry: This plugin captures anonymous data on package installation and searches. Anonymous telemetry data is collected for the following commands: conda create, conda install, conda search, and conda list.
  - The linux-s390x (IBM Z & LinuxONE) installer is no longer supported as of March 31, 2025.
  - Significant improvements for uninstallers:
    - macOS and Linux installations now come with an uninstall.sh file that removes the Anaconda Distribution installation. Additional options allow users to remove data files ($HOME/.conda), .condarc files, and cache files during the uninstallation. For more information, see our documentation.
    - Windows uninstallers will come with an extra page that allows users to delete data files (%USERPROFILE%\.conda), .condarc files, and cache files during the uninstallation. For more information, see our documentation.
  - In shell (.sh) installers, using environment variables for the installation directory in interactive installations now requires the envsubst command to be pre-installed.

  Bug fixes
  - The channels list in the .condarc file now points to defaults instead of explicit URLs. This helps prevent automatic injection of Anaconda’s main channels into the channel list.
  - In package (.pkg) installers, files created by conda init now have the correct owner.

  Known issues
  - The defaults channel is always added to the channels list. For workarounds, see the Anaconda troubleshooting page.
