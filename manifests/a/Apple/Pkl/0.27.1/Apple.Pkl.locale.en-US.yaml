ShortDescription: Configuration that is Programmable, Scalable, and Safe
Description: Pkl — pronounced Pickle — is an embeddable configuration language which provides rich support for data templating and validation. It can be used from the command line, integrated in a build pipeline, or embedded in a program. Pkl scales from small to large, simple to complex, ad-hoc to repetitive configuration tasks.
