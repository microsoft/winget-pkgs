Description: |-
  A powerful multimedia technology with a built-in media player, QuickTime lets you view Internet video and personal media in a wide range of file formats. And it lets you enjoy them in remarkably high quality.
  It’s a multimedia platform.
  Video from your digital camera or mobile phone. A movie on your Mac or PC. A media clip on a website. No matter what you're watching or where you're watching it, QuickTime technology makes it all possible.
  It’s a sophisticated media player.
  With its simple design and easy-to-use controls, QuickTime Player makes everything you watch even more enjoyable. Its clean, uncluttered interface never gets in the way of what you’re watching. Want to speed through a movie or slow things down? A handy slider lets you set playback from 1/2x to 3x the normal speed. And you can search through individual movie frames quickly.
  It’s advanced video technology.
  QuickTime features advanced video compression technology called H.264 to deliver brilliant, crisp HD video using less bandwidth and storage. So you’ll experience pristine video quality wherever you watch your videos.
  It’s a flexible file format.
  QuickTime lets you do more with your digital media. With QuickTime 7 Pro, you can convert your files to different formats and record and edit your work. Third-party plug-ins extend QuickTime technology in many different directions. And QuickTime streaming solutions let you stream your media across the Internet.
