ShortDescription: Servy lets you run any app as a native Windows service with full control over working directory, startup type, process priority, logging, health checks, pre-launch scripts and parameters.
Description: |-
  Servy lets you run any app as a native Windows service with full control over the working directory, startup type, process priority, logging, health checks, environment variables, dependencies, pre-launch and post-launch hooks, and parameters. It's designed to be a full-featured alternative to NSSM, WinSW, and FireDaemon Pro.

  Servy is digitally signed using a trusted code-signing certificate provided by the SignPath Foundation. This ensures that all Servy executables and installers are verified and secure, giving you peace of mind when using the tool.

  Servy offers a desktop app, a CLI, and a PowerShell module that let you create, configure, and manage Windows services interactively or through scripts and CI/CD pipelines. It also includes a Manager app for easily monitoring and managing all installed services in real time.

  Features:
  - Clean, simple UI
  - Monitor and manage all installed services with Servy Manager
  - Real-time CPU and RAM monitoring with live performance graphs for installed services
  - CLI and PowerShell module for full scripting and automated deployments
  - Run any executable as a Windows service
  - Set service name, description, startup type, priority, working directory, environment variables, dependencies, and parameters
  - Environment variable expansion supported in both environment variables and process parameters
  - Run services as Local System, local or domain accounts, Active Directory accounts, or gMSAs
  - Redirect stdout/stderr to log files with automatic size-based and date-based rotations
  - Run pre-launch hook before starting the service, with retries, timeout, logging and failure handling
  - Run post-launch hook after the application starts successfully
  - Supports Ctrl+C for command-line apps, close-window for GUI apps, and force kill if unresponsive
  - Prevent orphaned/zombie processes with improved lifecycle management and ensuring resource cleanup
  - Health checks and automatic service recovery
  - Browse and search logs by level, date, and keyword for faster troubleshooting from Servy Manager
  - Export/Import service configurations
  - Service Event Notification alerts on service failures via Windows notifications and email
  - Compatible with Windows 7-11 x64 and Windows Server editions
