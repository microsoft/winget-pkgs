ReleaseNotes: |-
  This is a 3.6.1 Patch 6.Editor:
  - Fixed Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V not working in GUI editor.
  - Fixed sprite export and copying a sprite to clipboard operations were always exporting a 32-bit image, regardless of the actual sprite's color depth.
  - Fixed "Recreate spritefile" command was unintentionally converting any sprite to 32-bit if its source was not found, and it was taking existing image from the old spritefile.
  Engine:
  - Fixed Software renderer could crash the game under some circumstances when the sprite cache's limit is exceeded (this is a regression in 3.6.1).
  - Fixed text-based lipsync's frame delay calculation: the existing formula was causing the delay value to "jump" back and forth with the slightest difference of speech text length, resulting in the speech lines of close length to be played with the notably different animation speeds.
  - Fixed drawing a 32-bit sprites on a 8-bit surface (e.g. a room mask), it was done wrong and was causing a memory corruption too.
  - Fixed drawing a room's walkable mask in script could cause errors during character walking if used colors exceeded walkable area number limit.
  - Fixed walk-behinds not drawn over characters and objects anymore (regardless of their baselines) after walk-behind mask was changed using drawing operations in script.
  - Fixed Game.SimulateKeyPress() not working in "old key-handling mode" (regression since 3.6.0).
  - Fixed script location is not reported in case of logical errors in engine's functions (regression since 3.6.0).
  WinSetup:
  - Removed an obscure "Use 85 Hz display" option.
