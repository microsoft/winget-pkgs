ShortDescription: Adventure Game Studio (AGS) provides the tools to make your own adventure, for free!
Moniker: ags
ReleaseNotes: |-
  Editor:
  - Fixed translation compiler mistreating escaped opening bracket in a text line ("\["); it must keep it as-is, because "[" char is a old-style line break in AGS.
  Engine:
  - Fixed loading translation entries larger than 1024 bytes.
  WinSetup:
  - Fixed "Save and Run" command sometimes caused 2 engine processes, one of which terminated later.
  This did not prevent a game from running, but could result in temporary CPU and memory overload.
