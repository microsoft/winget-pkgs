ReleaseNotes: |-
  This is a 3.6.2 Patch 1.
  Editor:
  - On failed new font import do not replace the font with font 0 in preview, as that's confuses users and hides import errors.
  - Fixed an unhandled exception which occured on Text Parser panel when user pressed Enter while no item is selected.
  Engine:
  - Try to detect incorrect argument types in string formatting functions such as String.Format, in attempt to avoid crashes when a '%s' format is used (this is still not 100% secure though).
  - Do not quit with error if a wrong GUI type is assigned as a "TextWindow GUI", display default message box instead and log a warning.
  - Fixed a crash occuring when reading Character.DestinationX/Y properties while the character is turning on spot after a call to FaceDirection.
  - Fixed a crash occuring when SpeechView is assigned a view that has no loops.
  - Fixed Lucas-Arts speech positioning mistake occuring, for example, when there's a big transparent GUI covering whole screen.
  - Fixed dialog options with no text, they were displayed and could be selected by player, which should not be happening.
  - Fixed Character.PlaceOnWalkableArea() and Room.NearestWalkableArea() returning wrong results if Room's mask resolution is not 1:1.
  - Fixed Direct3D and OpenGL renderers displaying sprites with occasional "magenta" pixels when "Smooth scaled sprites" setting is enabled but graphic filter is set to "Nearest-neighbour".
  Compatibility:
  - Support detecting and loading game data from Linux game ports where it's called "agsgame.dat", and is created using an older version of the third-party "agspack" utility.
  - Disable smooth walk transition in pre-3.6.1 games, as apparently this breaks logic in some of them where precise walking coordinates and/or timing is required by scripts.
  - Fixed misaligned text centering on buttons in pre-3.6.0 games.
