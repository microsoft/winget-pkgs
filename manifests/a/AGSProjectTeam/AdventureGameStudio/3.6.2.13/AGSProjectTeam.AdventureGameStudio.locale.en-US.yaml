ReleaseNotes: |-
  This is a 3.6.2 Patch 3.
  Common:
  - Removed a very old limit of 14 chars max lipsync filename.
  Editor:
  - In case of multiple objects selected in the editor (such as GUI controls or View Frames) Properties Grid will now hide properties that are not allowed to be assigned same value, such as ID or Name.
  - Resize all Buttons when changing an Image for multiple selected buttons at once.
  - In Room Editor added separate checkbox for "Move Room Objects From Bottom-Left". The respective Character's checkbox will no longer affect Room Objects.
  - Fixed editor not being able to find a event function in script if there was a comment on the same line as a function declaration.
  - Fixed bad script generated for Global Variables of String array type.
  - Fixed editor was suggesting Room 301 as a first non-state-saving room, while 300 is the one.
  - Fixed a error in "New Room" and "Change Room Number" dialogs where having number 300 and ticking "don't save state" checkbox would cause "value out of range" exception.
  - Fixed "Show sprite usage" did not account for Slider's background image.
  - Fixed text input fields on Colour Finder and Lip Sync panels did not fallback to the default text field setting in Color Theme in case their individual settings were missing.
  Compiler:
  - Fixed a crash caused by meeting certain unicode characters in script (outside of string or character literals).
  Engine:
  - When a room state restored from a save has a different number of Room Objects, it will be automatically fixed to match the number of Objects found in the current game's room.
  - Removed error triggered if a Wait or any similar "waiting" command was called in the starting room's "Before fade-in" event. For some reason this error was only shown if it's the first room in the game, which does not make much sense. There's still a warning logged in this circumstance.
  - Fixed magenta color on room background could be treated as transparent when it's a part of a walk-behind (regression in 3.6.2).
  - Fixed switching display modes while running a 16-bit game could lead to current graphical overlays (like character portraits, etc) become corrupted.
  - Fixed engine to not automatically switch from an empty view loop when animating character by command (should only do that when animating walking).
  - Fixed text height calculation did not account for the outline font's size (only for automatic outlining).
  - Fixed standard dialog options surface had excessive height (regression in 3.6.2).
  - Fixed mouse cursor may not get updated after "Before fade-in" event if there was a Display function called in it.
  - Fixed function such as Game.ScanSaveSlots(), ListBox.FillSaveGameList(), and similar, wrongly error when a single-slot range is passed (min slot = max slot).
  - Fixed a potential crash occuring when engine was trying to log a warning in case a invalid font was assigned to a Game's or GUIControl's Font property.
  - Fixed engine overwriting existing translations when duplicate keys are found in the translation file (it should keep the first met translation instead).
  - Fixed engine to not try to translate empty lines. There was a rare error when the translation contained an incorrect entry with empty key line but non-empty translation, in which case engine could display that "translation" anytime any label has empty text.
  WinSetup:
  - Fixed "Translation" option always reset to default when starting the setup program.
