ReleaseNotes: |-
  Editor:

  - Fixed a warning condition for copying 32-bit bitmaps to a desktop clipboard of less color depth.
  - Fixed keyboard shortcuts for GUI Editor's Copy and Paste commands.
  - Fixed a rare exception when scrolling the room in the editor.
  - Fixed "Auto-number speech lines" and "Create voice acting script" operations failing if a Character's name contains underscore.
  
  Compiler:

  - Fixed escaped character literals not being parsed correctly. This makes character literals like '\n' and '\t' actually work in script.
  
  Engine:

  - Updated SDL_Sound library to 2.0.3.
  - Improved OpenGL texture management, which should result in less system and video memory spent on sprite textures.
  - Fixed Character.AddWaypoint() potentially using wrong walkspeed, if multiple characters or objects are ordered to start a non-blocking move in a mixed order.
  - Fixed Character.AddWaypoint() is using incorrect speed if this room has a non 1:1 mask resolution, and "Scale speed with mask resolution" setting is enabled.
  - Fixed Overlay.Create() crashing the engine if a non-existing sprite is passed as an argument.
  - Fixed Say("...") command get stuck in endless loop if Speech.DisplayPostTimeMs is non-zero.
  - Fixed PlayFlic() not working if called second time in game. This is likely a regression since 3.6.0.
  - Fixed NumPad keys not handled properly by the engine (in on_key_press, IsKeyPressed, and TextBox control). This is a regression since 3.6.0.
  - Fixed OpenGL renderer causing scaled sprites to have colored outlines sometimes while using Linear filter.
