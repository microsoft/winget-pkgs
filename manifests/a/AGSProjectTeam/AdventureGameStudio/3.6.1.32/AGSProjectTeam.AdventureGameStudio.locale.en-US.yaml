ReleaseNotes: |-
  This is a 3.6.1 Patch 10.
  Editor:
  - Fixed a check for an imported room mask size did not correctly account for the room's mask resolution setting (it worked, but mishandled some edge cases).
  - Fixed exceptions occuring when reimporting a sprite or a audio clip from source, if the source filename string was wrapped in double quotes.
  - Fixed script variables generation could sometimes produce a non-latin character in a variable name if the Editor is running on a system with non-English current locale.
  - Fixed '\n' linebreaks not saved correctly in dialog option strings.
  - Fixed translation compiler mistreating escaped opening bracket in a text line ("\[");
  it must keep it as-is, because "[" char is a old-style line break in AGS.
  - Fixed LogPanel not applying filter settings right after they were changed.
  Engine:
  - Fixed a AudioChannel did not report a correct Position right after a AudioClip.PlayFrom() call.
  - Fixed Button resizing to sprite 0 size if NormalGraphic is set to 0 (default button look).
  - Fixed Character movement recalculation when changing move speeds while walking, and movement path contains 45-degrees diagonal segments.
  - Fixed a solid Character (serving an obstacle) can get ignored by a walking Character, if the obstacle character's position appears within the walking character's own blocking zone.
  (This seems to be a redundant condition introduced very long time ago in the engine by mistake.)
  - Fixed object's look not updated after it was assigned a dynamic sprite, redrawn, sprite deleted, object redrawn without a sprite (used a placeholder), and then another dynamic sprite assigned with coincidentally the same number.
  - Fixed font outline index limited to 127 (although we theoretically support higher font numbers).
  - Fixed font outline parameters not initialized correctly if engine is built by a system that treats "char" as unsigned 8-bit type.
  - Fixed a crash which occured when script mistakenly tried to call RunInteraction() for a inventory item 0.
  - Fixed loading translation entries larger than 1024 bytes.
  - Fixed SDL log level was defaulting to "verbose" if not read from config (should be "info").
  WinSetup:
  - Fixed "Save and Run" command sometimes caused 2 engine processes, one of which terminated later.
  This did not prevent a game from running, but could result in temporary CPU and memory overload.
