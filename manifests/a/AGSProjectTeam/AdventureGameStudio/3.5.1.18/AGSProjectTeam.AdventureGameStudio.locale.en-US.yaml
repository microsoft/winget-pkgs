  Engine:
  • Perfomance fix: GUIs changing Transparency or Visible state should not redraw their surface.

  Compatibility:
  • Allow AudioClip.Play to to place clips on a crossfade channel, which is normally unaccessible from script. This prevents errors in some games that relied on this behavior.
