ReleaseNotes: |-
  This is a 3.6.2 Patch 5.
  Editor:
  - Fixed 8-bit sprite import with "Leave as-is" option when image file does not use a transparent color. This resulted in regular color in slot 0 becoming a transparent instead.
  - Fixed Callstack panel not getting cleared when the game is shutdown, and clicking on its items could bring Editor into the wrong state.
  - Fixed crash occuring under some conditions when the Editor is trying to display a tooltip with the struct's member in script.
  - Fixed Autocomplete not displaying members of dynamic array's elements (was displaying dynamic array's "Length" property instead).
  - Fixed Autocomplete mistakes related to multidimensional arrays declared in script. (Although v3.* script compiler does not support multidimensional arrays, this fix prevents strange results if user have these in script for some reason.)
  - Fixed Autocomplete displaying generated types (dynamic array types), which it should not show to the user.
  - Fixed Autocomplete not displaying parent type's extender methods for child types.
  - Fixed script tooltip displaying extra pair of brackets for dynamic array variables.
  Engine:
  - Fixed Slider unexpectedly incremented MaxValue if it appears equal to MinValue.
  - Fixed Character's speech text's behavior being modified by a non-blocking voice clip run by a Game.PlayVoiceClip() call.
  - Fixed Game.PlayVoiceClip() not supporting narrator's voice.
  - Fixed voice clips played by Game.PlayVoiceClip() not resuming after restoring a save.
    (This is an old mistake present since the PlayVoiceClip function was introduced.)
