ReleaseNotes: |-
  This is a 3.6.1 Patch 12.
  Contains bug fixes accumulated for the last several months, that are applicable to 3.6.1.
  Editor:
  - Restrict Room's BackgroundAnimationDelay property to a range of 0-255 (engine's limitation).
  - Fixed View Editor reacting to shortcuts such as F or Delete when the input focus is set to a selected Frame's properties.
  Compiler:
  - Fixed a crash caused by meeting certain unicode characters in script (outside of string or character literals).
  Engine:
  - Do not enable "infinite FPS mode" if game script calls SetGameSpeed with a value 1000 or higher.
    The problem is that the script API does not have any means to turn this mode off, so game will be stuck in "maxed FPS". The remaining method is Ctrl+E hotkey used to toggle "infinite FPS" if the game is run with "--fps" command line argument.
  - Do not quit with error if a wrong GUI type is assigned as a "TextWindow GUI", display default message box instead and log a warning.
  - Do not quit if failed to run PlaySilentMIDI(), log a warning instead.
  - Do not try animating a cursor if the assigned view is invalid or contains no frames in loop 0.
  - Don't log warnings for File.Exists and Game.GetSaveSlotDescription when a file was not found, as these functions are meant to test a file existence.
  - Fixed engine's general misbehavior occuring if any Character, GUI or AudioClip does not have any ScriptName assigned.
  - Fixed room background animation running too fast if the BackgroundAnimationDelay was set to a value > 127.
  - Fixed Character.FaceDirection() and similar commands not resetting idle state.
  - Fixed dialog options were rendering twice per game frame (this did not cause any graphical glitches, but could cause extra performance issues).
  - Fixed slightly broken slider's handle position for thin sliders with very small handle sprites.
  - Fixed sprite cache or texture cache not initializing properly if their size in config is assigned to a too large number. The cache sizes will be now correctly limited to the max possible size available to the current engine build (32-bit or 64-bit).
  - Fixed Software renderer could potentially crash when the sprite cache reaches its limit and there's an overlay displayed on screen.
  - Fixed switching display modes while running a 16-bit game could lead to current graphical overlays (like character portraits, etc) become corrupted.
  - Fixed a DynamicSprite not updated on screen after CopyTransparencyMask() call (except when running with a Software renderer).
  - Fixed SeekMIDIPosition() and GetMIDIPosition() crashing the game if a "silent MIDI" is playing.
  - Fixed NumPad key presses doubling up when NumLock is on in a "old key-handling mode".
  - Fixed WaitInput() with infinite timeout suspending forever in a skipped cutscene.
  - Fixed mouse clicks could stop working after a call to a InventoryScreen() function, if player character does not have any items.
  - Fixed engine overwriting existing translations when duplicate keys are found in the translation file (it should keep the first met translation instead).
  - Fixed engine to not try to translate empty lines. There was a rare error when the translation contained an incorrect entry with empty key line but non-empty translation, in which case engine could display that "translation" anytime any label has empty text.
  - Fixed a "division by zero" crash occuring when the engine is precaching a View without frames.
  Compatibility:
  - If PlayVideo() is used to play a non-OGV file, then engine will lookup to a OGV file of the same name to play instead. This is made to let game authors or players of old games to convert wmv/avi video assets to ogv without recompiling game scripts.
  - Fixed loading games made by v2.56 editor which contain custom properties.
  - Fixed loading saves made by v3.4 - v3.4.1 engine in games with custom properties.
  - Disable smooth walk transition in pre-3.6.1 games, as apparently this breaks logic in some of them where precise walking coordinates and/or timing is required by scripts.
  - Fixed misaligned text centering on buttons in pre-3.6.0 games.
  Plugins:
  - Fixed a crash in AGSBlend plugin, occuring if DrawSprite function was called with transparency parameter = 100 (fully transparent).
  WinSetup:
  - If any of the cache sizes in config is set to a value not present in the option lists, the list will be assigned to the nearest matching value, instead of resetting to default.
