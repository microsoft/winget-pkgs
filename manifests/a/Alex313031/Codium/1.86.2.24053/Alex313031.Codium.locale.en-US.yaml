ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Re-worked and re-organized the entire repo after major changes upstream that made a simple merge impossible. As a consequence, it only shows "9 commits ahead", but really you should look at the number of changed files instead.
  - Linux version should also now work on Ubuntu 16.04 again (I haven't tested though).
  - Fixed issue on Windows 7 RTM (non SP1)
  - Rebased on upstream 1.86.2
  - Changed the "Quit" or "Exit" keyboard shortcut to Ctrl+Q for Windows/Linux, and Cmd+Shift+Q for MacOS (and Alt+F4 still works)
  - It should also work on Windows Vista SP2 with Extended Kernel Installed
  NOTE 2: I am able to get 1.87.x working fine, but the latest tip-of-tree 1.88.0 alpha has issues that might not be resolvable, thus, 1.87.x might be the last Codium version for Win7/8/8.1 ðŸ˜¢  If that is the case, it will still have been a good achievement of mine to keep vscode working for this long on those platforms, and indeed 1.87 will continue to be very usable for probably a good 2 years or so (that about how long the 1.70.3 (last "officially supported version") worked before stuff started breaking with extensions, network requests, etc). For users wanting another ressurected fork, might I suggest my Atom-ng Fork? It's a compiler optimized fork of Atom with updated Electron, updated packages, and some UI tweaks and branding changes. > If anyone would like to help me in the 1.88.x endeavor, head over to  and take a look at my //patches subdir. The issue isn't Electron 22, but rather, Node 16 (which comes bundled with Electron 22 and is needed to make some of the native modules work under 22), and a couple npm packages related to Azure integration that now require Node 18 to build at all.
