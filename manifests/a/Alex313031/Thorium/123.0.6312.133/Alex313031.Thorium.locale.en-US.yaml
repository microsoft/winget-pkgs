ReleaseNotes: |-
  M123
  - Enabled WebSQL by default (for things like Session Buddy 3)
  - More compiler optimizations in PGO (Linux-only for now) > https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium/commit/acf69ddd0fd1069fc39db86a8fee3644c5747c5a#diff-9b63dea0428a0efde7b9737c2b752678592868f64817cfbad4af4767d4bdfa84
  - More compiler optimizations (well, actually the removal of some LLVM flags) > https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium/commit/c55c6b3e1ba9550b9c11700f929f51e8c57853a3
  - Disabled the ugly "Chrome Refresh 2023" UI by default https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium/commit/ec8b741ecf60bf1cfc6e44428afb20764109430a however, if you decide you want it, set these two flags to true: chrome://flags/#chrome-refresh-2023 & chrome://flags/#customize-chrome-side-panel
  - If Chrome 2023 Refresh UI is enabled, then I added updated icons for the top bar (colored by default like usual, but can be made grey with the chrome://flags/#disable-thorium-icons flag). > https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium/commit/ec8b741ecf60bf1cfc6e44428afb20764109430a
  - Minor spacing and spelling fixes on some chrome:// pages that Thorium modifies. > https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium/commit/8d050fcf04e356c1a6dc2bed839181ae3a99872f
  - Added Policy Templates for people wanting to set enterprise policies, or simply to see the available Windows Registry keys to control certain behaviors. These are identical to the ones for Chromium, except the directory names and registry key names have been changed to "Thorium" so that you don't have to do that yourself. They are in the thorium_policy_templates.zip file. > https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium/commit/dcf4dd9848eb2a3041896d00eec135d3281d17ec
  - Added a Memorial easter egg dedicated to my Grandmother "Gramma Linda", who I spent the last month in the hospital with, and she sadly died March 23, 2024 at the age of 83. 😭 Born on Dec. 27th, 1940. You can view the easter egg by running Thorium from the cmdline with --enable-logging --v=1 >> C:\place\where\you\want\debug.log. The top of the logfile will print the Thorium brand name and version, and under that is my little memorial code. > https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium/commit/8c0850e25eb5946e33dbe400ce279630cfda87e7
  - The NTP page was broken when using a search engine other than Google, including the extra ones I added to some locales. I fixed it here > https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium/commit/e11300316f324c389fe513f12911014d3e1d605c
  - Fixed the disable-encryption flag not working properly (for users of the portable .zips) > https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium/commit/1ac0e00cbca58628e4e24c779dddd65569c158b8 This should fix issues where Thorium signs you out of sites on every restart.
  - Updated libhighway in the libjxl repo to 1.1.0 > https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium-libjxl/commit/1a4d1e77902ada5e673a1881d2efa54a6d55f95c for better SIMD optimization
  - Update libjxl to 0.10.2, which makes JPEG-XL rendering much faster, and fixes bugs when images were above a certain size > https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium-libjxl/commit/fb2a3d6a7925ecaab68b729fe64f6ea277221251
  Big news! On top of Thorium continuing to support Windows 7/8/8.1 (which I have been doing for a while now, since M110), Thorium now supports Windows XP and Windows Vista! I made a page dedicated to it, with an XP style theme similar to the Win7 page > https://thorium.rocks/xp/.
  Download releases for all these Pre-Windows 10 OSes here > https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium-legacy/releases
  This also means that Thorium now supports more OSes and architectures than ANY other browser on the market!. Windows XP - 11 x32, x64, and arm64. MacOS x64 and arm64. Linux x64 and Raspberry Pi arm64. And Android arm32, arm64, and x86.
  Thanks to @gz83 for helping with Windows builds + policy templates, and @win32ss for providing the baseline patches used to restore Windows XP/Vista support.
