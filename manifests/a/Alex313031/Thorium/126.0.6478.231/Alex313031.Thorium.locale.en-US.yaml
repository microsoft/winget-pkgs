ReleaseNotes: |-
  M126
  - This is also Thorium's 30th major version anniversary. Very first Thorium was based on M96.
  - Skipped M125 because it was too old. I was house-sitting for my dad/stepmom while they were away on a month long trip. I didn't have access to my workstation which I really need to do anything more than minor development work.
  - (Linux Only) kAllowWindowDragUsingSystemDragDrop was re-enabled at the source level. This should fix tab/window dragging issues on Wayland, but may cause other unforeseen bugs on Wayland. File bugs if appropriate. Can be disabled with the cmdline flag --disable-features=AllowWindowDragUsingSystemDragDrop
  - Google Hangouts component extension was removed, following concerns about privacy. However, if you use hangouts frequently and would like this extension back, see this ReadMe. Closes https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium/issues/743, https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium/issues/740, https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium/issues/449, https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium/issues/410
  - The Chrome Refresh 2023 UI is now the default.
  - I moved the tab search button back to the right of the tabstrip. I think it was a bad decision to put it on the left in the 2023 UI. However, if you prefer it on the left (to have Thorium's UI match Chrome's), enable the new chrome://flags/#left-aligned-tab-search-button flag I added.
  - Another performance bump due to some new PGO configs courtesy of @RobRich999. See this commit. In some limited testing it got better Speedometer 3.0 scores than Chrome.
  - libjxl updated to 0.10.3
  - Manifest V2 support force enabled (Starting in M128 they are experimenting with disabling MV2). It will be completely removed in M136 (10 months from now), and when they finally do remove the actual code for loading MV2 extensions, it will be restored, because F**k Google! Even if it takes a crapload of work, I am determined to restore it, because without UBlock Origin working properly in Thorium, I wouldn't even want to use my own browser! If you want to use other Chromium based browsers, you will eventually be out of luck, and will either need to use Firefox, or find another Chromium fork that has MV2 support when the time comes.
  - New flag chrome://flags#revert-from-portable can be used to prevent data loss when reverting a user profile from portable mode to normal mode (i.e. when turning off the disable-encryption and disable-machine-id flags). Can also be used when moving the user profile from one machine to another. Read the flag description for details.
  Two more things: – I have created a new user survey for 2024. The more responses I get, the better, and it will be used to guide decisions about Thorium into Q4 of 2024. Take the 8 question quick survey here > https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/355TK88 – I am hosting an art/image contest! The winner's image will be displayed on the easter egg page, as well as the chrome://version page. It should be an art or clipart image.
