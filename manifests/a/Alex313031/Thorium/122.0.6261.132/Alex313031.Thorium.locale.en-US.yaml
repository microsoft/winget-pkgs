ReleaseNotes: |-
  Nothing too special this release, just your standard Chromium upgrade.However, four things:- Fixed the profile picker crash, which would cause Thorium to just segfault and crash without warning or any useful log output if you tried to add a new profile, OR if you had multiple profiles already added. This is my fault and I was being a dummy last release. Let me explain: Last release notes I said "Enabled AutoPlay toggle in Settings, I previously had it disabled due to a crash". Well I literally left myself a comment line to remind me what the crash was >  Yet I just tested to make sure the browser didn't crash on startup (which it wouldn't on my end because I only use one profile). I forgot to check by making a new profile(s). Thus, I declared the bug "fixed" when it really wasn't, and promptly got spammed with a bunch of sad people who's browsers were crashing. This was a stupid mistake on my part, and I'm sorry to anyone whos workflows got interrupted and the frustration that people were having. I will probably leave this setting disabled indefinitely, since I already added a chrome://flags flag to control this behavior anyway > chrome://flags/#autoplay-policy  Fixes            and Alex313031/Thorium-MacOS#42
  - Disabled some more "Privacy Sandbox" bullcrap
  - Added a patch from Ungoogled to disable captive portal detection. Note this won't work in all cases. Fixes Alex313031/thorium#528
  - This release is actually ahead of the version in official stable Chrome right now (.128 minor rev), as I spotted a nice security fix in V8 that was not landed until the .132 minor revision.
  Also, I got more issues regarding people disliking the custom colored top bar icons. Reminder that since M121, I added a flag to disable these > chrome://flags/#disable-thorium-icons
