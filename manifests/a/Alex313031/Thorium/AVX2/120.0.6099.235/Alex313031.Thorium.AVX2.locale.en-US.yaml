ReleaseNotes: |-
  - More optimization flags as per guidance from @RobRich999 here > RobRich999/Chromium_Clang#26 (comment)
  - Re-enabled component ffmpeg.dll (in case you ever wanted to replace it with a version that doesn't have proprietary codecs to make a "fully FOSS" build. Most people won't want this as it breaks media playback on alot of sites (including Widevine).
  - Added a new right-click menu item to "Save video frame" which you can use to save a .png of the current paused frame.
  Added three new chrome://flags flags. These are:
  - chrome://flags/#vaapi-video-decode-linux-gl to toggle using the GL backend for VAAPI acceleration (Linux only). Fixes Alex313031/thorium#162
  - chrome://flags/#close-window-with-last-tab which allows you to keep the application open when closing the last tab (i.e. closing the last tab will simply open a new blank one). Fixes Alex313031/thorium#338
  - chrome://flags/#allow-insecure-downloads to fix the annoying issue where Thorium won't download files if they come from http:// ftp:// or "mixed origins" i.e. an http:// download initiated by an https:// page. Fixes Alex313031/thorium#509
