ReleaseNotes: |-
  Happy New Year Release!
  Whoo 😅 It took a long while to get here. Many months without updates.
  However, going forward, Thorium will be based on the latest LTS (Long Term Support) Chromium revision, which changes twice a year. This will let me focus on features, bug fixes, and keeping Thorium secure, instead of always having to do the long, tedious work of rebasing to a new major Chromium revision. With my new job, I simply don't have as much free time. M138 is the current one, M144 is going to be the new LTS in 2 months. In between, I can make minor updates to Thorium to address security concerns and major bugs.
  - Th24 now 98% complete, good enough for a release, Ill fix minor stuff in a future build.
  - Restored ability to install MV2 extensions from the web store (previously you would have to sideload a .crx, or keep MV2 extensions you already had installed in that user profile).
  - Fixed the Download Shelf crash, so chrome://flags/#download-shelf works again for people like me who hate the new download bubble. (bug in prev. beta release)
  - Fixed Notification settings crash that plagued the last release. (bug in prev. beta release)
  - Fixed Google sync not working and fixed translate not showing on some sites (bug in prev. beta release)
  - Added HEVC patches (bug in prev. beta release)
  - Windows Installer now has a dialog asking if you want to install (use --silentcommandline switch to revert to old silent behaviour)
  Also, thanks to @gz83 work, the FTP patch is restored and working! Since Supermium removed the FTP patch, this makes Thorium the only browser left on earth that still supports FTP. FTP users, continue as you were 😁
  Known Issues:
  1. Top bar window dragging space (above the tabs) when Window is unmaximized is too large on Windows and GTK3 (Linux)
  2. Some colored icons are missing in WebUI (people who hate my colored icons will rejoice 😆 )
  3. Ask.com was removed as a search engine.
  4. Easter eggs page isn't working (need to find out why, patches are in there)
  5. I added a new right click menu item "Open in same tab" to prevent links from opening in a new tab, however I put it at the top of the menu, which I found is terrible for muscle memory since I kept accidentally clicking it. Will move it in next release.
  EDIT: Sorry, took more like 50 hours to get the rest of the builds out. I'm in the middle of moving, so I've been physically exhausted. 😪
