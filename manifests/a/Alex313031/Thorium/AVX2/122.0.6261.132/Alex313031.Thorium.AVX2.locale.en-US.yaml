ReleaseNotes: |-
  Nothing too special this release, just your standard Chromium upgrade.
  However, four things:
  - Fixed the profile picker crash, which would cause Thorium to just segfault and crash without warning or any useful log output if you tried to add a new profile, OR if you had multiple profiles already added. This is my fault and I was being a dummy last release. Let me explain: Last release notes I said "Enabled AutoPlay toggle in Settings, I previously had it disabled due to a crash". Well I literally left myself a comment line to remind me what the crash was > https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium/commit/5373a94bf0e367529c5b9fb5dd07044fb341eba9#diff-67eea7cc5329808ed94c726a817ead2b1ac9a0d35a01e6360f553f7e63703572R1116 Yet I just tested to make sure the browser didn't crash on startup (which it wouldn't on my end because I only use one profile). I forgot to check by making a new profile(s). Thus, I declared the bug "fixed" when it really wasn't, and promptly got spammed with a bunch of sad people who's browsers were crashing. This was a stupid mistake on my part, and I'm sorry to anyone whos workflows got interrupted and the frustration that people were having. I will probably leave this setting disabled indefinitely, since I already added a chrome://flags flag to control this behavior anyway > chrome://flags/#autoplay-policy Fixes https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium/issues/577, https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium/issues/564, https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium/issues/596, https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium/issues/586, https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium/issues/570, https://github.com/Alex313031/Thorium-MacOS/issues/45, https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium/issues/575, https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium/issues/572, https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium/issues/599, https://github.com/Alex313031/Thorium-Win/issues/176, https://github.com/Alex313031/Thorium-Win/issues/169, and https://github.com/Alex313031/Thorium-MacOS/issues/42
  - Disabled some more "Privacy Sandbox" bullcrap
  - Added a patch from Ungoogled to disable captive portal detection. Note this won't work in all cases. Fixes https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium/issues/528
  - This release is actually ahead of the version in official stable Chrome right now (.128 minor rev), as I spotted a nice security fix in V8 that was not landed until the .132 minor revision.
  Also, I got more issues regarding people disliking the custom colored top bar icons. Reminder that since M121, I added a flag to disable these > chrome://flags/#disable-thorium-icons
