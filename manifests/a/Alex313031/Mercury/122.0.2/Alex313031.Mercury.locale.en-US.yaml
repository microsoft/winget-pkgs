ReleaseNotes: |-
  - More SIMD compiler optimizations
  - Fixed windows manifest
  - Removed annoying stuff in the Windows installer
  - Added mime type handling to the .deb
  - Added document .icns for MacOS
  - Added Raspberry Pi builds! While this will work on any arm64 computer, it is specifically tuned for the Cortex-A76 processor in the Raspi 4.
  - Added SSE3, SSE4, AVX, and AVX2 builds for both Windows and Linux.
  - Converted the portable .sh into an actual binary. Simply unpack the linux .zip(s), and run MERCURY_PORTABLE
  NOTE: The MacOS version is NOT 122.0.2. It is based on Tip-of-Tree since there are continuous issues building the stable, or "release" branch. The real version is 124.0a1. Treat it as a beta, although we have been using it with no problems. Once the stable release branch is updated to 124.x.x, then it will follow suit with the rest of the others. Mozilla is aware of the linker bugs, so we just have to wait.UPDATE: The MERCURY_PORTABLE binaries in the .zips are broken. I fixed it, and uploaded the file here. Please download that and replace the one in the .zip after you have extracted it.UPDATE 2: Added arm64 MacOS binaries.
