ReleaseNotes: |-
  115.3.0

  * Enabled installing unsigned extensions (fixes #43)
  * Fixed installer logos displaying incorrect on HiDPI displays
  * Added some patches from Ghostery, and updated the readme and patches.md.
  * Fixed ipc using incorrect module.ver
  * Added .svg version of the logo, and updated the installer to use these
  * Rather than using user agent compatibility mode, I made Mercury use Firefox's user agent string verbatim.
    Previously, installing extensions was broken because the UA string was an unknown one.
    I then enabled compat mode in 115.2.0, which added the Firefox string to it, but it still also had the Mercury string,
    which was still fucking up some sites. It now sends a UA string identical to upstream Firefox.
    There should be no more issues.

  TODO (Still lol): Add AppImage support, add UBlock Origin by default, and change some keyboard shortcuts.

  [UPDATE 1]: Corrected the linux .zip, I accidentally uploaded the previous version. Fixes #48

  [UPDATE 2] IMPORTANT: It seems to show up as a virus with windows defender and kapersky (but no other antiviruses).
  I thought I had fixed this! I personally would never install something that is flagged,
  but in this case I can promise that they are NOT malicious. Compile it for yourself and compare the binaries if you doubt me!
  I am so sorry but it seems to be related to the fact that they are not signed (which costs money). Please see > This Issue .
  IDK what else to do from here. If you are a Mercury user, I guess you will just have to "trust me bro" LOL.
