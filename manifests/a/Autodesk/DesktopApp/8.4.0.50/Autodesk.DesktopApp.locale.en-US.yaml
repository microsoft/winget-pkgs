Moniker: ada
ReleaseNotes: |-
  The list of products available for install has changed. Some products previously shown may be missing now or some products that were filtered out previously are now available. This is due to some logic change in ADA. If you believe that you are missing products that you should have access to, please check your Subscriptions and Contracts page to ensure you have access to those products or services.
  Serial Numbers are no longer available within ADA, nor are they included during product installation. As a result, during first-time launch of a serial-number based product installed via ADA, the Let’s Get Started screen is shown. To view the product serial number, click "View Serial Number" in ADA. This will open the Products and Services page and show the serial number for the product.
  Display of Privacy Settings dialog after the user signs into ADA.
  Minor user interface improvements.
