Description: |-
  Keep a website always-on-top and translucent. For Mac, Windows, and Linux.

  Top feature: It's simple and works like a charm ❤️

  * Adjustable transparency to ensure just the right level of visibility
  * Stays on top of other windows and out of your way
  * Optional "detached" mode which will let mouse clicks "pass through" Flōt to the window below
  * Built-in basic ad and tracker blocking
  * Simple and clean design with just the cutest little logo drawn by my wife
