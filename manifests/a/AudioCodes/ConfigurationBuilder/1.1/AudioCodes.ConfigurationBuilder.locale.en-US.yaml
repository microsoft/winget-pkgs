ShortDescription: Simplifies deployment of AudioCodes equipment by creating specific device configuration from the generic template.
Description: |-
  The Configuration Builder assists with initial configuration of AudioCodes Mediant Gateway, SBC and MSBR products. It may be used to create customer-specific wizard-syle interfaces that build CLI or INI files from the generic "templates".
  The typical workflow is as follows:
  - AudioCodes employee (FAE / Support / R&D) creates "template file" and matching "ui file". The former contains device configuration with specific parts of it replaced with %tags%. The latter contains definition of end-user interface that is used to get values for these %tags%.
  - The above two files (.template + .ui) are delivered to customer and placed in the same directory
  - Customer opens the wizard and chooses the specific .template file that he wants to work with
  - The wizard prompts customer to enter values for template-specific %tags% - as per the .ui file
  - When the customer completes all configuration screens, the wizard generates device configuration (INI or CLI) by expanding all %tags% and processing all #macros in the template
  - The generated configuration file can be saved to disk or loaded to the device
  Sample .template and .ui files can be found in example directory.
