ReleaseNotes: "See Release Notes for changesNotes for the avrdude Windows binaries (static linked to the dependency libraries) :- MSVC build is recommended for most Windows users unless you hit known limitations (see below). The majority of users should download avrdude-v7.3-windows-x64.zip. In case one of limitations below is unacceptable you may want to download avrdude-v7.3-windows_mingw-x64.zip.\n- Known limitation for the above MSVC build (avrdude-v7.3-windows-x64.zip, avrdude-v7.3-windows-x86.zip and avrdude-v7.3-windows-arm64.zip)\n- #1552 (no libserialport support)\n- #1253 (slow speed when using arduino-ft232r or similar programmer)\n- #968 (not working with USB Composite Device programer like USBASP with the FW from \n-  (no support of CH341A)\n- Known limitation for the MSYS2 mingw build (avrdude-v7.3-windows_mingw-x64.zip and avrdude-v7.3-windows_mingw-x86.zip and avrdude-v7.3-arduino_mingw32.zip)\n- You will have to use Zadig to switch the FTDI vendor driver if you use libftdi based programmer (eg: ft232h, ft2232h, arduino-ft232r)\n- #1271 (timeout may be more likely to happen for urclock in terminal mode)\nNotes for the Linux binaries:\nPlease use chmod u+x to make the binary executible.\nThe Linux binaries are static linked to dependency libraries, including libserialport. They are provided as is and are expected to work for most Linux distros within the past 5 years. Please build from source in case the binaries do not work for you.  You can also report the issue."
