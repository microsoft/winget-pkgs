ReleaseNotes: |-
  # .NET 6.0

  Fusion++ is now running on .NET6 and gets published as self-contained
  executable. That means, it has no runtime dependencies anymore - however the
  package size went from ~35MB to ~100MB.

  In addition, the UI components from DevExpress were updated and left their CTP state.

  As always, I hope you enjoy using Fusion++

  Have fun ✋
