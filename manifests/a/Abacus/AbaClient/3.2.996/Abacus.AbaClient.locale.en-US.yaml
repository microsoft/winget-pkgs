ShortDescription: AbaClient allows to log-in into your Abacus Business Software or AbaWeb - without any internet browser and without having java installed.
Description: |-
  AbaClient combines a Java environment controlled by Abacus with a browser tailored to Abacus needs. The Java environment is based on the open source project OpenJDK which does not cause any Oracle dependencies. The browser allows the use of and for Abacus generated certificates without warning messages.
  AbaClient recognises and supports the new "abalink" format, which will be used from Abacus version 2019.
  AbaClient also serves as a replacement for the product AbaStart.
