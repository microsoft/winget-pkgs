  ⚠️ WARNING
  Please back up your shared_preferences.json file before updating. Make a copy of the said file, which is located in the same folder as overkeys_config.json (Go to Preferences > Advanced > Open config file). Just to be sure, back up the overkeys_config.json file as well, especially if you've made changes to it. During testing, the installer reverted the settings back to their defaults. This might be an isolated case and may not affect future updates, but it is a good precaution to take nonetheless.
