ReleaseNotes: |-
  This release includes preliminary support for the pylock.toml file format, as standardized in PEP 751. pylock.toml is an alternative resolution output format intended to replace requirements.txt (e.g., in the context of uv pip compile, whereby a "locked" requirements.txt file is generated from a set of input requirements). pylock.toml is standardized and tool-agnostic, such that in the future, pylock.toml files generated by uv could be installed by other tools, and vice versa.
  As of this release, pylock.toml is supported in the following commands:
  - To export a uv.lock to the pylock.toml format, run: uv export -o pylock.toml
  - To generate a pylock.toml file from a set of requirements, run: uv pip compile -o pylock.toml -r requirements.in
  - To install from a pylock.toml file, run: uv pip sync pylock.toml or uv pip install -r pylock.toml
