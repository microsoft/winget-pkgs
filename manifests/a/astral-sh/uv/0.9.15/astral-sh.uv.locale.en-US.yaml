ReleaseNotes: |-
  Released on 2025-12-02.
  Continuing the unfortunate chain of disrupted releases, this release failed due to an error publishing new PEP 740 attestations to PyPI. The release workflow was re-run after removing the PEP 740 attestations (see #16944) and our GitHub and PyPI artifacts were published as normal, but the crates.io publish completed in the first run and does not match the 0.9.15 tag — instead, the crates were published at commit https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/commit/e7af5838bbd3fe00d45b0ae6f399975846dbf41b. The only difference is the inclusion of https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/16885.
