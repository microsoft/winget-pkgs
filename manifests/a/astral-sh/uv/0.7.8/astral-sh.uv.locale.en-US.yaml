  Python
  We are reverting most of our Python changes from uv 0.7.6 and uv 0.7.7 due to
  a miscompilation that makes the Python interpreter behave incorrectly, resulting
  in spurious type-errors involving str. This issue seems to be isolated to
  x86_64 Linux, and affected at least Python 3.12, 3.13, and 3.14.
  The following changes that were introduced in those versions of uv are temporarily
  being reverted while we test and deploy a proper fix for the miscompilation:
  - Add Python 3.14 on musl
  - free-threaded Python on musl
  - Add Python 3.14.0a7
  - Statically link libpython into the interpreter on Linux for a significant performance boost
  See the issue for details.
  Documentation
  - Remove misleading line in pin documentation (#13611)
