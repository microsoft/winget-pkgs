  Release Notes
  Since the launch of Python version, project, and tool management capabilities back in August, we've seen extraordinary adoption of uv. We've been iterating rapidly since then: adding new features, fixing bugs, and improving the user experience. Despite moving quickly, stability and compatibility has been a major focus â€” we've made thirty releases since our last breaking change. Consequently, we've accumulated various changes that improve correctness and user experience, but could break some workflows. This release contains those changes; many have been marked as breaking out of an abundance of caution. We expect most users to be able to upgrade without making changes.Breaking changes
  - Use base executable to set virtualenv Python path (#8481)Previously, uv canonicalized the path to the Python executable when setting the Python path in created virtual environments. This behavior had several undesirable effects: it would bypass stabilized version directories (as constructed by Homebrew) and it was not consistent with the Python standard library's behavior. Now, uv uses the sys._base_executable path.
  - Use XDG (i.e. ~/.local/bin) instead of the Cargo home directory in the installer (#8420)Previously, uv's installer used $CARGO_HOME or ~/.cargo/bin for its target install directory. It's been a longstanding complaint that uv uses this directory, as there's no relationship to Cargo. Now, uv will be installed into $XDG_BIN_HOME, $XDG_DATA_HOME/../bin, or ~/.local/bin (in that order). Note that $UV_INSTALL_DIR can always be used to override the target directory.
  - Discover and respect .python-version files in parent directories (#6370)Previously, uv only read .python-version files from the working directory. Now, uv will check parent directories for .python-version files; however uv will not search for .python-version files beyond project boundaries. The new behavior is better aligned with that of pyenv and Rye.
  - Error when disallowed settings are defined in uv.toml (#8550)Some settings can only be defined in the pyproject.toml. Previously, uv would ignore these settings when present in the uv.toml. Now, uv will error to avoid confusion about why the settings are not respeced.
  - Implement PEP 440-compliant local version semantics (#8797)Previously, uv's implementation of local versions (e.g. 2.0+cpu) was not compliant with the specification due to the technical complexity of implementing the local version semantics in the PubGrub algorithm. Thanks to the work of @ericmarkmartin, uv now has a spec-compliant implementation. Namely, uv will now allow a request for torch==2.1.0 to install torch@2.1.0+cpu regardless of whether torch@2.1.0 (without a local tag) actually exists.
  - Treat the base Conda environment as a system environment (#7691)Previously, uv would not distinguish between the base and other Conda environments. Now, uv uses CONDA_DEFAULT_ENV and the names base and default to determine if an environment active via CONDA_PREFIX is the base environment. If the base environment is active, the --system flag must be used to mutate it.
  - Do not allow pre-releases when the != operator is used (#7974)Previously, uv would use the presence of a pre-release specifier in a version specifier as an opt-in to allow pre-release versions during resolution. The new behavior does not allow pre-releases when an inequals operator is used, e.g., != 2.0a1.
  - Prefer USERPROFILE over FOLDERID_Profile when selecting a home directory on Windows (#8048)This change is a side-effect of switching from the directories crate to etcetera for determining canonical system paths. If USERPROFILE is not set, the behavior will be unchanged.
  - Improve interactions between color environment variables and CLI options (#8215)Previously, uv would respect the FORCE_COLOR and NO_COLOR environment variables over the --color flag. Now, when the --color flag is explicitly provided, uv will respect it over the environment variables.
  - Make allow-insecure-host a global option (#8476)Previously, this option was only available in some parts of uv. Now, --allow-insecure-host can be provided to any command. For consistency, the allow-insecure-host setting has been removed from the [tool.uv.pip] configuration in favor of [tool.uv].
  - Only write .python-version files during uv init for workspace members if the version differs (#8897)Previously, uv would create a .python-version file for workspace members during uv init. Now, uv will only do so if the version differs from the .python-version file in the workspace root since uv will respect .python-version files in parent directories.
