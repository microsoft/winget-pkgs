ReleaseNotes: |-
  Python
  - On Mac/Linux, libtcl, libtk, and _tkinter are built as separate shared objects, which fixes matplotlib's tkagg backend (the default on Linux), Pillow's PIL.ImageTk library, and other extension modules that need to use libtcl/libtk directly.
  - Tix is no longer provided on Linux. This is a deprecated Tk extension that appears to have been previously broken.
  See the python-build-standalone release notes for details.
