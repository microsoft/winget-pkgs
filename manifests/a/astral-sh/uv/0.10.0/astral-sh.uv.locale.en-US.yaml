ReleaseNotes: |-
  Since we released uv 0.9.0 in October of 2025, we've accumulated various changes that improve correctness and user experience, but could break some workflows. This release contains those changes; many have been marked as breaking out of an abundance of caution. We expect most users to be able to upgrade without making changes.
  This release also includes the stabilization of preview features. Python upgrades are now stable, including the uv python upgrade command, uv python install --upgrade, and automatically upgrading Python patch versions in virtual environments when a new version is installed. The add-bounds and extra-build-dependencies settings are now stable. Finally, the uv workspace dir and uv workspace list utilities for writing scripts against workspace members are now stable.
  Breaking changes
  - Require --clear to remove existing virtual environments in uv venv (#17757)
    Previously, uv venv would prompt for confirmation before removing an existing virtual environment in interactive contexts, and remove it without confirmation in non-interactive contexts. Now, uv venv requires the --clear flag to remove an existing virtual environment. A warning for this change was added in uv 0.8.
    You can opt out of this behavior by passing the --clear flag or setting UV_VENV_CLEAR=1.
  - Error if multiple indexes include default = true (#17011)
    Previously, uv would silently accept multiple indexes with default = true and use the first one. Now, uv will error if multiple indexes are marked as the default.
    You cannot opt out of this behavior. Remove default = true from all but one index.
  - Error when an explicit index is unnamed (#17777)
    Explicit indexes can only be used via the [tool.uv.sources] table, which requires referencing the index by name. Previously, uv would silently accept unnamed explicit indexes, which could never be referenced. Now, uv will error if an explicit index does not have a name.
    You cannot opt out of this behavior. Add a name to the explicit index or remove the entry.
  - Install alternative Python executables using their implementation name (#17756, #17760)
    Previously, uv python install would install PyPy, GraalPy, and Pyodide executables with names like python3.10 into the bin directory. Now, these executables will be named using their implementation name, e.g., pypy3.10, graalpy3.10, and pyodide3.12, to avoid conflicting with CPython installations.
    You cannot opt out of this behavior.
  - Respect global Python version pins in uv tool run and uv tool install (#14112)
    Previously, uv tool run and uv tool install did not respect the global Python version pin (set via uv python pin --global). Now, these commands will use the global Python version when no explicit version is requested.
    For uv tool install, if the tool is already installed, the Python version will not change unless --reinstall or --python is provided. If the tool was previously installed with an explicit --python flag, the global pin will not override it.
    You can opt out of this behavior by providing an explicit --python flag.
  - Remove Debian Bookworm, Alpine 3.21, and Python 3.8 Docker images (#17755)
    The Debian Bookworm and Alpine 3.21 images were replaced by Debian Trixie and Alpine 3.22 as defaults in uv 0.9. These older images are now removed. Python 3.8 images are also removed, as Python 3.8 is no longer supported in the Trixie or Alpine base images.
    The following image tags are no longer published:
    - uv:bookworm, uv:bookworm-slim
    - uv:alpine3.21
    - uv:python3.8-*
    Use uv:debian or uv:trixie instead of uv:bookworm, uv:alpine or uv:alpine3.22 instead of uv:alpine3.21, and a newer Python version instead of uv:python3.8-*.
  - Drop PPC64 (big endian) builds (#17626)
    uv no longer provides pre-built binaries for PPC64 (big endian). This platform appears to be largely unused and is only supported on a single manylinux version. PPC64LE (little endian) builds are unaffected.
    Building uv from source is still supported for this platform.
  - Skip generating activate.csh for relocatable virtual environments (#17759)
    Previously, uv venv --relocatable would generate an activate.csh script that contained hardcoded paths, making it incompatible with relocation. Now, the activate.csh script is not generated for relocatable virtual environments.
    You cannot opt out of this behavior.
  - Require username when multiple credentials match a URL (#16983)
    When using uv auth login to store credentials, you can register multiple username and password combinations for the same host. Previously, when uv needed to authenticate and multiple credentials matched the URL (e.g., when retrieving a token with uv auth token), uv would pick the first match. Now, uv will error instead.
    You cannot opt out of this behavior. Include the username in the request, e.g., uv auth token --username foo example.com.
  - Avoid invalidating the lockfile versions after an exclude-newer change (#17721)
    Previously, changing the exclude-newer setting would cause package versions to be upgraded, ignoring the lockfile entirely. Now, uv will only change package versions if they are no longer within the exclude-newer range.
    You can restore the previous behavior by using --upgrade or --upgrade-package to opt-in to package version changes.
  - Upgrade uv format to Ruff 0.15.0 (#17838)
    uv format now uses Ruff 0.15.0, which uses the 2026 style guide. See the blog post for details.
    The formatting of code is likely to change. You can opt out of this behavior by requesting an older Ruff version, e.g., uv format --version 0.14.14.
  - Update uv crate test features to use test- as a prefix (#17860)
    This change only affects redistributors of uv. The Cargo features used to gate test dependencies, e.g., pypi, have been renamed with a test- prefix for clarity, e.g., test-pypi.
  Stabilizations
  - uv python upgrade and uv python install --upgrade (#17766)
    When installing Python versions, an intermediary directory without the patch version attached will be created, and virtual environments will be transparently upgraded to new patch versions.
    See the Python version documentation for more details.
  - uv add --bounds and the add-bounds configuration option (#17660)
    This does not come with any behavior changes. You will no longer see an experimental warning when using uv add --bounds or add-bounds in configuration.
  - uv workspace list and uv workspace dir (#17768)
    This does not come with any behavior changes. You will no longer see an experimental warning when using these commands.
  - extra-build-dependencies (#17767)
    This does not come with any behavior changes. You will no longer see an experimental warning when using extra-build-dependencies in configuration.
  Enhancements
  - Improve ABI tag error message phrasing (#17878)
  - Introduce a 10s connect timeout (#17733)
  - Allow using pyx.dev as a target in uv auth commands despite PYX_API_URL differing (#17856)
  Bug fixes
  - Support all CPython ABI tag suffixes properly (#17817)
  - Add support for detecting PowerShell on Linux and macOS (#17870)
  - Retry timeout errors for streams (#17875)
