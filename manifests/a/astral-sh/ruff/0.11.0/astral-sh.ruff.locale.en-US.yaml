ReleaseNotes: |-
  This is a follow-up to release 0.10.0. Because of a mistake in the release process, the `requires-python` inference changes were not included in that release. Ruff 0.11.0 now includes this change as well as the stabilization of the preview behavior for PGH004.

  Breaking changes
  - **Changes to how the Python version is inferred when a `target-version` is not specified** (#16319)

      In previous versions of Ruff, you could specify your Python version with:

      - The `target-version` option in a `ruff.toml` file or the `[tool.ruff]` section of a pyproject.toml file.
      - The `project.requires-python` field in a `pyproject.toml` file with a `[tool.ruff]` section.

      These options worked well in most cases, and are still recommended for fine control of the Python version. However, because of the way Ruff discovers config files, `pyproject.toml` files without a `[tool.ruff]` section would be ignored, including the `requires-python` setting. Ruff would then use the default Python version (3.9 as of this writing) instead, which is surprising when you've attempted to request another version.

      In v0.10, config discovery has been updated to address this issue:

      - If Ruff finds a `ruff.toml` file without a `target-version`, it will check
          for a `pyproject.toml` file in the same directory and respect its
          `requires-python` version, even if it does not contain a `[tool.ruff]`
          section.
      - If Ruff finds a user-level configuration, the `requires-python` field of the closest `pyproject.toml` in a parent directory will take precedence.
      - If there is no config file (`ruff.toml`or `pyproject.toml` with a
          `[tool.ruff]` section) in the directory of the file being checked, Ruff will
          search for the closest `pyproject.toml` in the parent directories and use its
          `requires-python` setting.

  Stabilization
  The following behaviors have been stabilized:

  - `blanket-noqa` (PGH004): Also detect blanked file-level noqa comments (and not just line level comments).

  Preview features
  - [syntax-errors] Tuple unpacking in `for` statement iterator clause before Python 3.9 (#16558)
