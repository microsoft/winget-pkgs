ReleaseNotes: |-
  Released on 2026-02-03.

  Check out the blog post for a migration guide and overview of the changes!

  Breaking changes
  - Ruff now formats your code according to the 2026 style guide. See the formatter section below or in the blog post for a detailed list of changes.

  - The linter now supports block suppression comments. For example, to suppress N803 for all parameters in this function:

      ```python
      # ruff: disable[N803]
      def foo(
          legacyArg1,
          legacyArg2,
          legacyArg3,
          legacyArg4,
      ): ...
      # ruff: enable[N803]
      ```

      See the documentation for more details.

  - The `ruff:alpine` Docker image is now based on Alpine 3.23 (up from 3.21).

  - The `ruff:debian` and `ruff:debian-slim` Docker images are now based on Debian 13 "Trixie" instead of Debian 12 "Bookworm."

  - Binaries for the `ppc64` (64-bit big-endian PowerPC) architecture are no longer included in our releases. It should still be possible to build Ruff manually for this platform, if needed.

  - Ruff now resolves all `extend`ed configuration files before falling back on a default Python version.

  Stabilization
  The following rules have been stabilized and are no longer in preview:

  - `blocking-http-call-httpx-in-async-function` (ASYNC212)
  - `blocking-path-method-in-async-function` (ASYNC240)
  - `blocking-input-in-async-function` (ASYNC250)
  - `map-without-explicit-strict` (B912)
  - `if-exp-instead-of-or-operator` (FURB110)
  - `single-item-membership-test` (FURB171)
  - `missing-maxsplit-arg` (PLC0207)
  - `unnecessary-lambda` (PLW0108)
  - `unnecessary-empty-iterable-within-deque-call` (RUF037)
  - `in-empty-collection` (RUF060)
  - `legacy-form-pytest-raises` (RUF061)
  - `non-octal-permissions` (RUF064)
  - `invalid-rule-code` (RUF102)
  - `invalid-suppression-comment` (RUF103)
  - `unmatched-suppression-comment` (RUF104)
  - `replace-str-enum` (UP042)

  The following behaviors have been stabilized:

  - The `--output-format` flag is now respected when running Ruff in `--watch` mode, and the `full` output format is now used by default, matching the regular CLI output.
  - `builtin-attribute-shadowing` (A003) now detects the use of shadowed built-in names in additional contexts like decorators, default arguments, and other attribute definitions.
  - `duplicate-union-member` (PYI016) now considers `typing.Optional` when searching for duplicate union members.
  - `split-static-string` (SIM905) now offers an autofix when the `maxsplit` argument is provided, even without a `sep` argument.
  - `dict-get-with-none-default` (SIM910) now applies to more types of key expressions.
  - `super-call-with-parameters` (UP008) now has a safe fix when it will not delete comments.
  - `unnecessary-default-type-args` (UP043) now applies to stub (`.pyi`) files on Python versions before 3.13.

  Formatter
  This release introduces the new 2026 style guide, with the following changes:

  - Lambda parameters are now kept on the same line and lambda bodies will be parenthesized to let them break across multiple lines (#21385)
  - Parentheses around tuples of exceptions in `except` clauses will now be removed on Python 3.14 and later (#20768)
  - A single empty line is now permitted at the beginning of function bodies (#21110)
  - Parentheses are avoided for long `as` captures in `match` statements (#21176)
  - Extra spaces between escaped quotes and ending triple quotes can now be omitted (#17216)
  - Blank lines are now enforced before classes with decorators in stub files (#18888)
