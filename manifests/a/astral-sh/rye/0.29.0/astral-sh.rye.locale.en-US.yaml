ShortDescription: a hassle-free Python experience
Description: |-
  Rye is a comprehensive project and package management solution for Python.
  Born from [its creator's](https://github.com/mitsuhiko) desire to establish a
  one-stop-shop for all Python users, Rye provides a unified experience to install and manages Python
  installations, `pyproject.toml` based projects, dependencies and virtualenvs
  seamlessly.  It's designed to accommodate complex projects, monorepos and to
  facilitate global tool installations.  Curious? [Watch an introduction](https://youtu.be/q99TYA7LnuA).
  A hassle-free experience for Python developers at every level.
