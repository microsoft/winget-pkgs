ReleaseNotes: |
  ## New
  1. Hide symbols when hovering over them.
     This feature was removed in 2.28.0 due to problems, now it is added again.
  2. added state code rule, toggle code rule, and which state is the basis for judgement in the customisation of setting input method mode.
  3. added independent configurations for symbols in different states.
  4. added a new software icon when the app is paused.
  
  ## Changes
  1. merge 讯飞输入法 and 手心输入法 modes in the setting of Input Method modes into Custom.
     There are now only two input method modes: General and Custom.
  2. All configurations in the text symbols are independent and no longer depend on the configurations in the box symbols.
     Before 2.31.0, the transparency, offset, border style and background colour of text symbols are determined by the same configurations in box symbols.
  3. the calculation of values for configuration items has been standardised so that some items that previously scaled with DPI no longer scale with DPI
     This can cause symbols to become smaller after a version change, and you will need to resize the width and height.
  4. no longer use powershell to unzip mouse style folders
     But this has also caused InputTip.exe to become much larger, but only by about 6 MB!
  
  ## All code has been refactored
