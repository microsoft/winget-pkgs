ShortDescription: Powerful, fast, and free SPICE simulator software, schematic capture and waveform viewer with enhancements and models for improving the simulation of analog circuits.
Description: LTspice® is a powerful, fast, and free SPICE simulator software, schematic capture and waveform viewer with enhancements and models for improving the simulation of analog circuits. Its graphical schematic capture interface allows you to probe schematics and produce simulation results, which can be explored further through the built-in waveform viewer.

  New Features
  What’s New in LTspice 24.1
  - Added a SCOPEDATA choice to the voltage/current source dialog. The file name can now be a string parameter.
  - Improved performance and convergence
  - Behavioral source expressions using node voltages like "V(node)" can use a string parameter, e.g. "V({param})"
  - Relaxed netlist syntax requirements
  - Syntax errors inside unused sub-circuit definitions in libraries are silently ignored if they are not instantiated
  - MOS Model binning now silently ignored if only one model
  - Improved stepped trace behavior in waveform viewer
  - Improved Nyquist for Loop waveform representation behavior
  - Convergence optimizations
  - Add .savestate and .loadstate simulator directives to save and restore the complete transient simulation condition
  - Add .option debugtran to add report in log file to help identify convergence challenges
  - Enhanced netlist syntax checking
  - Changed default integration method to Trapezoidal

  What’s New in LTspice 24
  We recommend that you update components after installing or updating LTspice.
  In LTspice, choose Tools > Update Components to install the latest LTspice library and models.

  Component libraries and AppData
  - Faster, cleaner component updates
  - Libraries are cleaned up or overwritten on updates
  - Optional user-defined libraries for additional discrete components
  - By default, LTspice looks in Documents\LTspice for user.*
  (user.dio, mos, res, cap, ind, bead, jft, bjt)
  - Directory is configurable in Settings > Search Paths
  - Users should not edit ADI-provided files in %localappdata%\LTspice
  - LTspice will attempt to dissuade users from saving files here
  > Optionally share anonymous usage analytics to help us improve LTspice
  SPICE Log file improved and streamlined
  - Report LTspice version, non-default tolerances, etc
  Usability improvements, such as
  - More items on Help menu, including Open Examples
  - New toolbar button to tile windows vertically
  - Settings dialog remembers last tab
  - Command line batch mode (-b) writes to stdout instead of showing GUI
  Numerous bug fixes
