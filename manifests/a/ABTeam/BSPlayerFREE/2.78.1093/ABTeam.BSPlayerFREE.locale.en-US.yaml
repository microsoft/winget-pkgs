Description: "Ever since the very beginning in the year 2000, the BS.Player™ has been one of the world's most popular video players. It is popular for many reasons. One however should be pointed out: BS.Player™ is the first software movie player ever to enable its users to focus on watching the movie instead of dealing with poor computer capabilities or running around looking for a proper setting and codec. Also, it has very low CPU and RAM requirements."
