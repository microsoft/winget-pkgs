  - Support for Chipset temperature sensor on X570 mainboards added.
  - Improved support for MSI NUC126 fan control.
  - You can now set individual temperature limits for CPU, all GPU temperatures, all HDD/SSD temperatures as well as fan speed thresholds for each channel.
  - The individual warning thresholds for each sensor are now placed in Settings/Display/Configuration.
  - In case you had configured warnings, please check and adjust them in the new interface.
