ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Manual scaling of the program window:
    In the past years we received from time to time requests if Argus Monitor could not be displayed enlarged or if the automatic scaling of Argus Monitor by Windows could not be switched off for systems with multiple monitors and different scaling factors.
    With version 6.2.01 we have therefore introduced the option of manual scaling of the Argus Monitor program window, to be found under Settings/Display.
      - In automatic mode, Argus Monitor scales its size according to the Windows scaling factor (adjustable in Windows Settings), as before.
      - In the new manual mode you can adjust the size of Argus Monitor in different steps and thus override the automatic scaling of the program window by Windows.
    This feature is currently still in BETA status as not all variants of possible Windows scaling factors and of possible setups for systems with multiple monitors could be tested yet.
  - Improved Support (fan control) for Nuvoton NCT6686D SuperIO monitoring chips for AsRock mainboards.
  - Support for ITE IT87952 SuperIO monitoring chips added.
  - Several other improvements and bug fixes.
