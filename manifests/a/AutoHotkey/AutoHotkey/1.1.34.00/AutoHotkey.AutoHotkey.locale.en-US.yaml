ShortDescription: Macro-creation and automation-oriented scripting utility for Windows.
Description: AutoHotkey is a free, open source macro-creation and automation software utility that allows users to automate repetitive tasks. It is driven by a custom scripting language that has special provision for defining keyboard shortcuts, otherwise known as hotkeys.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Added the capability to use AutoHotkey.exe as the base for compiled scripts, allowing compiled scripts to execute external files when passed the /script command-line switch.
  Added the capability to implicitly include code at the top of every script, either by embedding a resource within AutoHotkey.exe or by using the /include command-line switch.
  Enabled the use of Menu NoMainWindow/MainWindow in uncompiled scripts.
  Changed ~x & y:: to not affect suppression of x when disabled by #If.
  Enhanced FileCopyDir to permit the source directory to be a zip file, if supported by the OS, in which case its contents are extracted.
  Fixed execution of multiple run-once timers in the same tick [broken by v1.1.33.11].
  Fixed ToolTip positioning/sizing bugs.
  - Attempting to position a tooltip overlapping the taskbar caused it to appear at the top of the screen instead, on Windows 10 and 11.
  - Tooltips were limited by the primary screen's width even when they should appear on a secondary screen, and this could prevent them from appearing on the appropriate screen (when they're too wide).
  - The maximum width was effectively A_ScreenDPI/96 times larger than it should be due to OS behaviour; this is now accounted for.
  Optimized ToolTip for cases where the text isn't changing, to reduce flicker and speed it up.
  Fixed key-up hotkeys failing to execute if they are turned on after (but not before) the key is pressed down, and that key is also a custom prefix key with the tilde suffix (e.g. ~a & b:: interferes with a up).
  Fixed custom combo hotkeys where the prefix key causes a hook reset, such as ~RButton & WheelUp:: when RButton:: enables or disables the script's only keyboard hook hotkey.
