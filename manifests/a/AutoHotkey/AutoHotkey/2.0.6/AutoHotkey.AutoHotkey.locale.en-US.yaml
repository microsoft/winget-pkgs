ReleaseNotes: |-
  Fixed some ambiguity with COM calls, such as x.y acting as x.y().
  Fixed breakpoint on control flow statement being "hit" when a fat arrow function on the line below it returns.
  Fixed Default : to not merge with the line below it. This prevented Default : from being used at the end of a Switch block, and caused any subsequent line to take the line number of the Default.
  Optimized ProcessGetPath, ProcessSetPriority and ProcessClose to not scan through all processes when given a valid PID, even if access to the process is denied.
  Fixed inability of LWin::Alt to be used to activate some Alt key combos.
  Fixed TypeError thrown by x is y to say "Class" rather than "Object".
  Fixed WinTitle to support criteria longer than 1023 characters.
  Fixed issues when &ref is used on different aliases of the same variable.
  Fixed optional parameter default expressions (other than simple literal values) preventing the use of assume-global/assume-static.
