ReleaseNotes: |-
  Added VerCompare().
  Added support for breakpoint exceptions via DBGp.
  Extended #Requires to support operators for range checks (< <= > >= =) and additional keywords: Unicode, ANSI, 32-bit, 64-bit.
  Added CompanyName to the version information in AutoHotkey.exe, which may work around a Windows 10 bug where the program would not appear in Open With.
  Changed Switch/Case to perform non-numeric comparison when the switch or case expression is a lone literal string, such as "00", and documented comparison behaviour which was previously undocumented.
  Fixed some inconsistencies with integer property names via IDispatch.
  - Negative values always being considered non-numeric.
  - Positive values losing formatting, such as leading zeroes.
  Fixed potential crashes when inspecting a ComObject via DBGp after using ComObjConnect.
  Fixed FileAppend to treat a blank Encoding as omitted.
  Fixed version comparisons to ignore numeric build info; e.g. 1.1.35.00+1+abcdef (1 is the number of commits since 1.1.35.00).
  Fixed FileCreateDir X\Y\ (with trailing slash) failing to create X [broken by v1.1.35.00].
