ShortDescription: Macro-creation and automation-oriented scripting utility for Windows.
Description: AutoHotkey is a free, open source macro-creation and automation software utility that allows users to automate repetitive tasks. It is driven by a custom scripting language that has special provision for defining keyboard shortcuts, otherwise known as hotkeys.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Fixed the error dialog to handle letter key shortcuts even when text is focused.
  Fixed MonthCal W-n (number of month) width values to not be affected by DPI scaling.
  Fixed Click to not return an integer.
  Fixed detection of key::try { as an error.
  Fixed :B0*O:XY::Z to produce XYZ rather than XZ (suppressing Y).
  Fixed Send to leave any prior {modifier Down} in effect even if the key happens to be physically held down.
  Improved the reliability of the script taking focus when a menu popup is shown.
  Debugger Improvements
  Fixed stdout/stderr packets sent during the processing of another command to not corrupt the pending response.
  Fixed property_get -n <exception>.message and similar.
  Fixed corrupted results from property_get when a property returns a temporary object with a string, such as x.y.z where y => {z:"a"}.
  Fixed crashes when an asynchronous command is received during the processing of another command.
  Fixed exceptions not being deleted after they are suppressed via property_set.
  Fixed property_get -c 0 -d 0 to allow global variables, as already allowed by -d 1.
  Fixed property_get paging enumerated items incorrectly.
  Improved property_get to support property getters with one parameter (previously only the implicit __Item property supported this).
  Improved property_get to support properties of primitive values. The value must still be contained by a variable or returned from a property.
  Improved property_get to allow calling functions with <=1 parameter.
  Improved property_get to support float keys/parameters.
  Changed debugger to suppress exceptions during property evaluation.
  Changed debugger to ignore errors thrown by __Enum (treat as no items).
  Changed the <enum> pseudo-property to require __Enum. This prevents the object itself from being called as an enumerator.
  Small code size optimizations in the debugger.
