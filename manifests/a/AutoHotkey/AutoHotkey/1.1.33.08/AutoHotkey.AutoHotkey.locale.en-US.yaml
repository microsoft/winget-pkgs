ReleaseNotes: |-
  Fixed non-zero SendLevel events erroneously being suppressed in cases not covered by the v1.1.33.07 fix:
  - When there's a matching context-sensitive hotkey with a higher #InputLevel and no enabled global variant.
  - When there's no matching key-down hotkey, but there's a key-up hotkey with a higher #InputLevel.
