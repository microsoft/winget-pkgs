ShortDescription: Macro-creation and automation-oriented scripting utility for Windows.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Fixed ByRef parameters erroneously assigning the default value to the caller's VarRef if unset.

  Fixed some issues affecting suppressed Alt/Ctrl/Shift/Win hotkeys, such as:
  - *LCtrl:: blocked LCtrl from the active window, but sending Alt-key combinations would fail because the system thinks Ctrl is down, and would therefore send WM_KEYDOWN instead of WM_SYSKEYDOWN.
  - *LAlt:: caused the system to forget any prior {LAlt DownR}, so a remapping such as LCtrl::LAlt would not behave correctly while LAlt is physically down, even though LAlt was suppressed.
  - Other potential issues where the system's low-level tracking of a modifier key doesn't match up with the logical state.

  Fixed some issues affecting continuation sections:
  - Escape sequences in the Join option were translated twice, causing ```` to become one literal ` instead of two, ``n to become a linefeed, and similar.
  - `" or `' produced a literal backtick and ended the string, instead of producing a literal quote mark, if the continuation section was enclosed in quotes of the same type and lacked the ` option.

  Optimized the automatic escaping of quote marks and backtick in continuation sections.

  Fixed breakpoint_list (debugger) returning duplicates on lines containing fat arrow functions.

  Fixed +BackgroundDefault failing to override the Gui's BackColor property.
