ShortDescription: Macro-creation and automation-oriented scripting utility for Windows.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Changed GroupActivate and GroupClose to behave more intuitively:
  - Evaluate windows against the window group as a whole, not individual window specifications.
  - When GroupClose indirectly causes another matching window to activate, leave it active even if it isn't matched by the same window specification.
  Contributions by jeeswg (pull requests #186, #235, #240, #249, #273, #274):
  - Backported operators !==, >>> and >>>= from v2.
  - Backported A_InitialWorkingDir from v2.
  - Backported File.Handle from v2.
  - Backported A_Clipboard from v2.
  - Backported IsSet() from v2.

  Bug-fixes:
  Fixed a spelling error in the #Warn Unreachable message.
  Fixed FileCreateDir handling of paths containing ".." or "/".
  Fixed some issues with FileSelectFile's RootDir\Filename parameter:
  - Filename not being used when RootDir is a badly formatted CLSID.
  - Undefined behaviour for long paths when GetShortPathName fails (such as when long path awareness is disabled or there's a default filename which isn't an existing file).
  Fixed FileSetTime to set A_LastError if it finds no files.
  Fixed EnvAdd/+= losing precision when adding 115,292,150,461+ seconds.
  Fixed the keyboard hook reinserting a suppressed dead key when Enter is pressed, such as in the sequence `o{Enter} when the following is true:
  - A separate script has suppressed "ò" due to :?*:ò::.
  - The current process also has active hotstrings.
  - The other process installed its hook last.
  Fixed ControlGet List "Selected" option repeating output on x64 when the target is 32-bit.
  Fixed stack corruption for ControlGet List "Count" options.
