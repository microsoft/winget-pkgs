ReleaseNotes: |-
  ## New features

  - Browser list can be sorted from the UI. This affects both configuration and
    the picker dialogs.
  - By popular demands, picker is redesigned again to have a more traditional look
    and feel with some modern twist. Although v5 picker was wheely cool, it was
    slightly impractical to use.
  - bt can be installed and upgraded via winget - winget install aloneguid.bt.
    5.0.5 is already available but it may take a few days for 5.1.0 to catch up
    with this release.

  ## Bugs fixed

  - When re-discovering browsers, existing order is kept intact.
