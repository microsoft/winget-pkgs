ReleaseNotes: |-
  Improvements
  - Class-reflected schemas for map complex types will generate key/value properties with "key" and "value" names, respectively. This is required in order to deserialise externally generated parquet files with dictionaries.
  - Updated dependent packages.
  - Class deserializer will check for type compatibility when deserialising incompatible types, which will prevent accidental data loss or narrowing. Thanks to @dkotov in #573.
  - Write RowGroup total size and compressed size by @justinas-marozas in #580.
  - DELTA_BYTE_ARRAY aka "Delta Strings" encoding can read byte array types in addition to string types.
  Bug fixes
  - Adopted to breaking change in Parquet specification (technically it's a fault of upstream, not this library's) resulting in bugs like #576 and #579.
  - Boolean fields encoded in RLE failed to read at all. Technically RLE can be used for integer and booleans, but we only ever supported integers.
  Changes
  - Removed .NET 6 build target as it is out of support.
  Floor
  - Compiled using .NET 9 (upgrade from .NET 8).
