  ACDSee Photo Studio Home 2026 equips you with the tools to master your extensive photo collection.

  Exciting new features and significant improvements in ACDSee Photo Studio Home 2026 will have a massive impact on your digital asset management and photo editing workflow.

  - Transform a dull, muted image into one that feels sharp, dimensional, and alive with the Dehaze tool. Applying Dehaze restores depth and vibrancy by cutting through the haze, fog, or smoke to show richer contrast, clearer details, and more accurate colors. It’s especially useful for landscape photography where distant mountains, city skylines, or natural vistas lose impact due to haze, but it’s equally powerful for everyday shots that need clarity and punch.
  - No more waiting for tasks to complete—thanks to the updated Activity Manager, background processing lets you continue working while operations run. With multi-threading, multiple activities run simultaneously, so you can import, convert and resize batches of photos, and detect faces, all without ever slowing down. Track progress in real-time and experience a faster, more efficient workflow designed for high-volume demands.
  - Take charge of your workflow from the moment you launch ACDSee. The new Home Page gives you immediate access to essential tools. Jump into Quick Searches, filter your photos with one-click options like Recently Modified or Tagged, and perform common tasks such as importing images, finding duplicates, or cataloging files—all from a single screen.
  - Narrower face labels in View Mode ensure no one is missed while using AI Face Detection on group photos. Find your people faster with new grouping options in People Mode, ACDSee Photo Studio’s AI-driven mode for identifying and managing people in your portfolio. Change modes without skipping a beat, your selection will remain right where you left it as you switch between modes.
