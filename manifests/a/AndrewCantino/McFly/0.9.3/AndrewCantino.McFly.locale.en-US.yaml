ShortDescription: Fly through your shell history. Great Scott!
Description: |-
  McFly replaces your default Ctrl-R shell history search with an intelligent search engine that takes into account your working directory and the context of recently executed commands. McFly's suggestions are prioritized in real time with a small neural network.
  TL;DR: an upgraded Ctrl-R where history results make sense for what you're working on right now.
