ReleaseNotes: |-
  Version 1.9.0
  Added
  - Per-package headers field support #718
    - Since this is adding support for missing features, I treat this as a bugfix and not bump minor version.
  - De-duplicating duplicated projects or Unity in VCC project list #1081
  - vrc-get cache clear, command to clear package cache #1204
  - Importing / Exporting Repositories list #1209
    - vrc-get repo import <list file> and vrc-get repo export
  - User Package Management #1222
    - This release adds vrc-get user-package subcommands to manage user packages.
  - vrc-get reinstall <package id> to reinstall specified packages #1223
  - Skipping finding legacy assets when downgrading / upgrading / reinstalling package #1581
    - This will speed up the process of downgrading / upgrading / reinstalling package.
  Changed
  - Error message will be shown if the SHA256 hash of the downloaded zip file does not match with the hash in the repository #1183
    - Currently, official VCC does not verify the hash of the downloaded zip file, but it's better to verify the hash.
    - For compatibility, even if the hash does not match, the file will be extracted with an error message.
    - In the future, we may make this a hard error.
  - Migration feature is no longer marked as experimental #1559
  Fixed
  - Unity from Unity Hub will be registered as manually registered Unity #1081
  - Fails to uninstall packages on macOS with filesystem that doesn't support resource fork #1402
    - This is typically seen on ExFAT or FAT32 filesystems, not on APFS or HFS+ filesystems.
    - macOS internally creates files starting with ._ for resource fork if the filesystem does not support resource fork.
    - vrc-get-vpm does not handle this file correctly and fails to uninstall the package.
  - Prerelease version is choosen even if good stable version exists #1745
