ShortDescription: Refreshingly fast LLMs on GPUs and NPUs
Description: "\U0001F34B Lemonade Server is a server interface that uses the standard Open AI API, allowing applications to integrate with local LLMs. This means that you can easily replace cloud-based LLMs with private and free LLMs that run locally on your own PC's NPU and GPU."
