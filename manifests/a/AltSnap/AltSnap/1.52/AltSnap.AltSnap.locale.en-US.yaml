ReleaseNotes: |-
  Again a bug-fix release, Update is strongly advised.
  • New: A help message was added to the test window to indicate how to setup snap layout (zones).
  • Changed: some code refactoring and unification inducing size reduction.
  • Fixed: Lag when dragging and resizing some programs (issue #160)
  • Fixed: #172, drag was locked down when combining and action and hotclick. Also, now if a hotclick is combined with the Move or Resize action then a long click will be forwarded to the pointed program is no drag occurred. This long click will not even be necessary if you enabled the Avoid blocking Alt+Click option in the General tab of the config.
  • Fixed: #124, A window will be restored to its original position when using the Move+Resize click combo without a drag.
  • Fixed: bugs in rolling and snapping code.
  • Updated French and Italian translations
  • Updated German translation, thanks to @Ichisich.
