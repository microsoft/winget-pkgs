ReleaseNotes: |-
  massCode v4 is here ðŸš€
  Weâ€™re excited to announce the release of massCode v4 â€” a major milestone that brings a brand-new foundation, improved performance, and a powerful set of tools for developers.
  This version is not just an update â€” the app has been rebuilt from the ground up with a modern stack, a new database engine, and a set of utilities designed to supercharge your workflow.
  Key Changes
  Modern Tech Stack
  The entire application has been rewritten using:
  - Tailwind CSS 4.0 â€” utility-first styling
  - Better SQLite3 â€” high-performance database
  - Elysia.js â€” lightweight and efficient REST API framework
  Migration to SQLite
  Snippets are now stored in SQLite instead of JSON files, bringing:
  - Faster performance with large datasets
  - Atomic operations and transactions
  - More reliable data storage
  - Efficient searching and filtering
  Developer Tools
  massCode v4 ships with a new suite of built-in utilities:
  - Text Tools: Case Converter, Slug Generator, URL Parser
  - Crypto & Security: Hash/HMAC, Password Generator, UUID
  - Encoders/Decoders: URL, Base64, JSON â‡„ TOML/XML/YAML, Text â‡„ ASCII/Binary/Unicode, Color Converter
