ReleaseNotes: |-
  [New
  Feature] Room Passcode Protection
  Rooms can now be secured with a passcode. When enabled, participants must enter the correct passcode before joining. Built-in protection limits repeated incorrect attempts.
  [New
  Feature] Reactions
  Express yourself during meetings with emoji reactions. Send quick responses like applause, hearts, or thumbs up directly from the stage controls. Moderators can also trigger full-screen stage effects visible to all participants.
  [Feature
  Update] Improved Audio Quality on Unstable Connections
  Voice communication now uses a faster, more resilient connection method. This results in noticeably reduced delay and significantly better audio quality, especially on unstable or congested networks. If the new connection method is unavailable, alfaview switches seamlessly with no action required.
  [Feature
  Update] Gallery View with Adjustable Grid Size
  The gallery view now supports configurable grid sizes with up to 200 video tiles per page. Grid size options are managed per room, giving administrators control over the maximum number of visible participants based on room capacity.
  [Feature
  Update] Improved Camera Compatibility on Windows
  alfaview now supports a wider range of webcams and virtual cameras on Windows, resolving compatibility issues that previously prevented certain devices from being detected or used.
  [Feature
  Update] Sharper Text on Windows
  Text rendering on Windows has been improved with smarter settings that adapt to your display. Standard-resolution monitors show crisper small text, while high-resolution displays get smoother curves. Custom font rendering options are available in Accessibility settings.
  [Feature
  Update] Web Client Now Supports Safari and Mobile Browsers
  The alfaview web client is no longer restricted to specific browsers. Safari and mobile browsers are now supported, as long as the browser meets the necessary technical requirements.
