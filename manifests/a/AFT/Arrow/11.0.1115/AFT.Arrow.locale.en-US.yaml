ReleaseNotes: |-
  --- Changes that may affect engineering conclusions ---

  1. Fixed an issue where an Assigned Pressure or Reservoir junction with Energy Balance on and multiple pipes directed as flowing into the junction but all having reverse flow causes an erroneous temperature discontinuity between the junction and these attached pipes.
  2. Fixed a bug where reverse flow restriction choked junctions in Arrow would compute results in the user-specified upstream (flow-direction downstream) pipe incorrectly, and warn of sonic choking at an incorrect junction.

  --- Important non-engineering changes ---

  1. Fixed an issue where a Bend/Elbow's R/D value could be improperly imported from a PCF file in languages where a comma is used as the decimal mark.
  2. Added more options to help load results faster when a very large number of Events are generated during runs.
  3. Revised which pump curves are shown while plotting Composite Pump vs. System Curve graphs.
  4. Fixed an issue where FCV inclusions in Pump Vs. System graphs were not being restored in the graph definition checkboxes after loading from a graph tab or graph list item.
  5. Fixed an issue where the eLicense code entry window could appear during a license error even if a valid Registration file was present.

  --- Miscellaneous changes ---

  1. Added display of library file path in the Edit Junctions section of Library Manager and allowed right click to copy the path to clipboard.
  2. Added 'Workspace' and 'Special' buttons to Global Junction Morph panel.
  3. Fixed a case when creating Design Alerts would clear output Warning messages.
  4. Implement shift click on row and column headers within output data.
  5. When using custom Rectangular Ducts on models built on older versions, saving the model will now preserve Duct Diameter and units associated with it.
  6. Updated loading new libraries with older models.
  7. Updated Workflow to display when memory constraint is reached.
  8. Scenario Manager tree structure will now preserve scenario order when cloning scenarios with children and when adding scenarios within Batch Run.
