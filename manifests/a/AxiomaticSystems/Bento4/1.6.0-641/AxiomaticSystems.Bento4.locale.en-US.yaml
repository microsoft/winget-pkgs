ShortDescription: A fast, modern, open source C++ toolkit for all your MP4 and DASH/HLS/CMAF media format needs.
Description: |-
  Bento4 is a C++ class library and tools designed to read and write ISO-MP4 files. This format is defined in international specifications ISO/IEC 14496-12, 14496-14 and 14496-15. The format is a derivative of the Apple Quicktime file format, so Bento4 can be used to read and write most Quicktime files as well. In addition to supporting ISO-MP4, Bento4 includes support for parsing and multiplexing H.264 and H.265 elementary streams, converting ISO-MP4 to MPEG2-TS, packaging HLS and MPEG-DASH, CMAF, content encryption, decryption, and much more.
  Features
  A number of formats and features based on the ISO-MP4 format and related technologies are also supported, including:
  - MPEG DASH with fragmented MP4 files, as defined in the international specification ISO/IEC 23009-1
  - HLS with TS or MP4 segments (dual DASH/HLS output), as defined in RFC 8216
  - CMAF (Common Media Application Format) as defined in ISO/IEC 23000-19
  - MPEG Common Encryption (CENC) as specified in the international specification ISO/IEC 23001-7
  - PIFF (Protected Interoperable File Format), and encrypted, fragmented MP4 format specified by Microsoft and used for encrypted HTTP Smooth Streaming.
  - Reading and writing 3GPP and iTunes-compatible metadata.
  - ISMA Encrytion and Decryption as defined in the ISMA E&A specification
  - OMA 2.0 and 2.1 DCF/PDCF Encryption and Decryption as defined in the OMA specifications.
  - ISO-MP4 files profiled as part of the 3GPP family of standards.
  - The UltraViolet (DECE) CFF (Common File Format).
  - Parsing and multiplexing of H.264 (AVC) video and AAC audio elementary streams
  - Support for multiple DRM systems that are compatible with MP4-formatted content (usually leveraging CENC Common Encryption), such as Marlin, PlayReady, Widevine, FairPlay and Adobe Access.
  - Support for a wide range of codecs, including H.264 (AVC), H.265 (HEVC), AAC, HE-AAC, xHE-AAC, AC3 and eAC3 (Dolby Digital), AC4, Dolby Atmos, DTS, ALAC, and many more.
  - Support for Dolby Vision and HDR.
  The SDK is designed to be cross-platform. The code is very portable; it can be compiled with any sufficiently modern C++ compiler. The implementation does not rely on any external library. All the code necessary to compile the SDK and tools is included in the standard distribution. The standard distribution contains makefiles for unix-like operating systems, including Linux and Android, project files for Microsoft Visual Studio, and an XCode project for MacOS X and iOS. There is also support for building the library with the SCons build system as well as CMake.
