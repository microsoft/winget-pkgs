Description: |-
  Axialis Screensaver Producer is a professional screensaver authoring tool for Windows which lets you easily create hi-quality screensavers for all versions of Windows

  For business purpose, or simply for your personal use, you'll be able to create all kinds of screensavers, including:
  - Sprites - Creating state-of-art screensavers with sprites (animated objects moving on screen) has never been easier. For example, you'll be able to create in minutes a cool screensaver with your company logo bouncing on screen.
  - Photo Slideshows - You can use many different transitions including the famous "fade-in & fade-out" effects. Several options are available to meet your needs: background sounds, ability to attach a speech to each image, display with automatic screen resolution adjustment, and more.
  - Videos - If you have created a video, you'll be able to create a screensaver from it in minutes. For example, it's a great idea for a company to make a screensaver from a TV ad clip. Many file formats are supported: AVI, MPEG, ASF, MOV, MP4, FLV, 3GP.

  The whole Screensaver Producer interface was designed to increase your productivity:
  - Fully Integrated Workspace - All the tools are easily accessible on screen. The application fully supports mouse drag & drop allowing intuitive operations.
  - WYSIWYG Editor - To increase your productivity, we have created an advanced WYSIWYG screensaver editor with full Drag & Drop support. WYSIWYG means "What You See Is What You Get". So no surprise at compilation time, your final screensaver is strictly identical.
  - Built-in Librarian - A powerful Librarian was included in the interface to let you manage your icon collections with ease. Always visible on screen, it fully supports drag & drop operations and more.
  - Powerful File Explorer - A built-in file explorer permits browsing your disks and find files including images and all files containing icons.

  You can evaluate a program during a trial period of 30 days after the installation without any cost or obligation.
