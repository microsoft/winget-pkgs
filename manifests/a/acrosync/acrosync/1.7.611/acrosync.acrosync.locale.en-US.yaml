ShortDescription: A native rsync client for Windows
Description: |-
  Acrosync for Windows can sync entire folders with any Linux/Mac/NAS without installing server software.
  That is because it is the only native Windows implementation of rsync, a powerful folder sync tool that is ubiquitously installed by default in the non-Windows world.

  Acrosync for Windows is not dependent on cygwin and it is very easy to install. Just download a small installer and a few clicks later you're ready to go. An ssh client is built-in, so there is no need to setup password-less login for rsync over ssh.

  Based on the rsync protocol, Acrosync is smart enough to sync files that only exist or are newer on the source while skipping identical files. Moreover, if only a small portion of a large file is modified, Acrosync will only transfer the modified portion instead of the entire file to save bandwith and improve speed.

  Acrosync integrates a file system monitor that can detect file changes. Using the default backup mode, new or modified files will be automatically and almost instantly uploaded to the rsync server. File deletions can also be automatically propagated to the server if the 'propagate deletions' option is selected.

  Acrosync for Windows comes with a 15 day trial with all features available.
