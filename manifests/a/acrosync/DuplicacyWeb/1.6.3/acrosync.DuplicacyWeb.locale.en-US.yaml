Description: |-
  Duplicacy backs up your files to many cloud storages with client-side encryption and the highest level of deduplication. This is the full-featured web-based GUI frontend supporting all major operations.

  This is the full-featured web-based GUI frontend supporting all major operations (backup, restore, check, copy, and prune) as well as other features such as scheduling and email notifications. It also integrates a dashboard to provide a graphical view of the status of storages and backups.

  This version can be used without a license if you only need the restore, check, copy, and prune operations.
  If you do need to run backups, a fully functional 30-day trial license will be automatically downloaded to enable the backup operation.
  After 30 days, a personal or commercial license can be purchased.
