ShortDescription: access a Windows named pipe compatible with command-line tools and WSL
Description: npiperelay is a tool that allows you to access a Windows named pipe in a way that is more compatible with a variety of command-line tools. With it, you can use Windows named pipes from the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Essentially it exposes stdin and stdout to processes in WSL, and relays information to a named pipe used by processes running in Windows, typically with help of the socat tool in the WSL distro.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  This is a release of my forked project, from branch [fork](https://github.com/albertony/npiperelay/tree/fork). See below for full changelog, listing all commits since previous fork release. The primary asset of the release is a direct download link for a ready-to-use build of the application's single executable, as well as an alternative .zip archive containing the same executable. It is built with Go version 1.25.2.

    <summary>About this fork</summary>
  <p></p>
  
  This release is from my fork of [jstarks/npiperelay](https://github.com/jstarks/npiperelay), adding some smaller improvements on top of upstream release [v0.1.0](https://github.com/jstarks/npiperelay/releases/tag/v0.1.0). The changes are conservative; primary concern is to keep the code updated and secure, considering upstream has not been updated since this first release back in mid 2020. See previous release notes for fork releases starting with [v1.0.0](https://github.com/albertony/npiperelay/releases/tag/v1.0.0) to learn about all changes.

    <summary>Checksums</summary>
  <p></p>
  
  GitHub automatically computes SHA-256 checksums for all release assets, which you can see to the right of the asset names in the "Assets" section below. These are generated at upload time and are immutable. The build system also computes SHA-256 checksums of built executables, and these are published as text file asset `npiperelay_checksums.txt`. Note that the .zip asset for the amd64 (x64/64-bit) and 386 (x86/32-bit) architectures both contain a single executable with name `npiperelay.exe`, and it is identical to the .exe asset with same name as the .zip asset, i.e. `npiperelay_windows_386.exe` and `npiperelay_windows_amd64.exe`, and should therefore have the same checksum.
  
  These are the SHA-256 checksums of all binary release assets, as published in `npiperelay_checksums.txt`:

    <summary>Antivirus</summary>
  <p></p>
  
  If your local antivirus treats the downloaded archive or executable as suspicious or malicious, you should try to report it as a false positive, e.g. to Symantec on [symsubmit.symantec.com](https://symsubmit.symantec.com) (select "Clean software incorrectly detected"). At the time of the release, no security vendors on [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com) flagged the asset download urls as malicious, but some very few (well below 10%) did flag the zip archive and executable files themselves (see report for each of the assets in expandable section below). The implementation is less than 300 lines of go code, plus a single, commonly used, third party dependency. The source code is automatically run through vulnerability analysis, using Go's [govulncheck](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck) and GitHub's [CodeQL](https://codeql.github.com), and a long list of code quality checks (linters), using [golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run/) (see [.golangci.yml](https://github.com/albertony/npiperelay/blob/fork/.golangci.yml) for the complete list). If you do worry, you are free to analyse the code yourself, and you can also [build](https://github.com/albertony/npiperelay#building) the executable locally from source.
