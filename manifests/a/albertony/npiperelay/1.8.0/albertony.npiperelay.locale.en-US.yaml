ShortDescription: access a Windows named pipe compatible with command-line tools and WSL
Description: npiperelay is a tool that allows you to access a Windows named pipe in a way that is more compatible with a variety of command-line tools. With it, you can use Windows named pipes from the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Essentially it exposes stdin and stdout to processes in WSL, and relays information to a named pipe used by processes running in Windows, typically with help of the socat tool in the WSL distro.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  This is a release of my forked project, from branch fork.
  In addition to the usual maintenance, this adds two new features thanks to contributions from @SunMar. Thank you very much üëè. It also upgrades to the newly released 1.24 version of Go. See below for full changelog, listing all commits since previous fork release.
  The primary asset of the release is a direct download link for a ready-to-use build of the application's single executable, as well as an alternative .zip archive containing the same executable. It is built with Go version 1.24.0.
  About this fork
  This release is from my fork of jstarks/npiperelay, adding some smaller improvements on top of upstream release v0.1.0. The changes are conservative; primary concern is to keep the code updated and secure, considering upstream has not been updated since this first release back in mid 2020. See previous release notes for fork releases starting with v1.0.0 to learn about all changes.
  Checksums
  The SHA-256 checksums of the binary release assets are published as text file asset npiperelay_checksums.txt. Note that the .zip asset for the amd64 (x64/64-bit) and 386 (x86/32-bit) architectures both contain a single executable with name npiperelay.exe, and it is identical to the .exe asset with same name as the .zip asset, i.e. npiperelay_windows_386.exe and npiperelay_windows_amd64.exe, and should therefore have the same checksum.
  These are the SHA-256 checksums of all binary release assets, as published in npiperelay_checksums.txt:

  Antivirus
  If your local antivirus treats the downloaded archive or executable as suspicious or malicious, you should try to report it as a false positive, e.g. to Symantec on symsubmit.symantec.com (select "Clean software incorrectly detected"). At the time of the release, no security vendors on VirusTotal flagged the asset download urls as malicious, but some very few (well below 10%) did flag the zip archive and executable files themselves (see report for each of the assets in expandable section below). The implementation is less than 300 lines of go code, plus a single, commonly used, third party dependency. The source code is automatically run through vulnerability analysis, using Go's govulncheck and GitHub's CodeQL, and a long list of code quality checks (linters), using golangci-lint (see .golangci.yml for the complete list). If you do worry, you are free to analyse the code yourself, and you can also build the executable locally from source.
