  NOTE: The build for v2.8.1 failed to publish to Chocolatey due to an error from chocolatey (as seen in -the build logs](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/activescott/lessmsi/builds/52665675)) and we don't have an easy way to upload it manually. Hopefully the next version published will be back on Chocolatey.
