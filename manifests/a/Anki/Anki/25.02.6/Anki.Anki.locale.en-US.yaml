ShortDescription: Powerful and intelligent flash cards.
Description: |-
  Anki is a program which makes remembering things easy.
  Because it's a lot more efficient than traditional study methods, you can either greatly decrease your time spent studying, or greatly increase the amount you learn.
  Anyone who needs to remember things in their daily life can benefit from Anki.
  Since it is content-agnostic and supports images, audio, videos and scientific markup (via LaTeX), the possibilities are endless.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Another security update. Windows users are strongly recommended to update.
  - Specially-crafted sound file references could cause files to be written to arbitrary locations on Windows. Thanks again to Michael Lappas for his investigation.
  - References to audio files outside of the media folder are no longer allowed.
  - Ensure mpv is tidied up even on a crash, which should fix the mpv errors some people got when updating.
