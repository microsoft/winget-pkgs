ShortDescription: Powerful and intelligent flash cards.
Description: |-
  Anki is a program which makes remembering things easy.
  Because it's a lot more efficient than traditional study methods, you can either greatly decrease your time spent studying, or greatly increase the amount you learn.
  Anyone who needs to remember things in their daily life can benefit from Anki.
  Since it is content-agnostic and supports images, audio, videos and scientific markup (via LaTeX), the possibilities are endless.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Editor Improvements
  • Ctrl/Cmd+A in tag editing area now selects all tags (thanks to BlueGreenMagick).
  • Fixed backspace sometimes removing multiple images at once (thanks to Henrik).
  • Fixed copying and pasting MathJax on Windows (Qt6).
  • Fixed handling of < and > symbols in MathJax (thanks to Henrik).
  • Fixed intermittent editor loading failures when add-ons have injected a large amount of code.
  • Fixed pasting of local files of unsupported types that contain spaces (thanks to Abdo).
  • Fixed some formatting being lost when copying between fields on Windows (Qt6).
  • Fixed various issues with tag editing (thanks to BlueGreenMagick and Henrik).
  • Pressing tab on the last field now moves focus to tag area (thanks to Henrik).
  • Reduce size of editor buttons on Windows/Linux (thanks to Henrik).
  • Tags copied from the tag editor are no longer joined together when pasted into the add tags/remove tags dialogs (thanks to Henrik).
  • The Qt5 Mac build now caps tag autocomplete matches to 10, as showing more is extremely slow in the old toolkit version.

  Other Improvements
  • Update Qt to 6.3.0, which fixes slow loading of large images, and inertial scrolling on macOS.
  • Fixed an error when previewing cards and selecting multiple cards (thanks to Rumo).
  • Fixed Anki needing to close when invalid modification times encountered by the browser on Windows.
  • Fixed colpkg imports not being cancellable (thanks to Rumo).
  • Fixed current working directory changing on apkg export.
  • Fixed custom browser font not being honored (Qt6).
  • Fixed custom study applying the previously-input limit, instead of the current one.
  • Fixed due graph showing wrong date for review cards in a filtered deck with rescheduling disabled.
  • Fixed grey background in type answer text + dark mode (thanks to Matthias).
  • Fixed v3 scheduler allowing one extra card when review limit reached (thanks to Rumo).
  • Lists on cards are now aligned to the left by default (thanks to Matthias).
  • Removed the highlight on the Show Answer and Good buttons.
  • Reset page zoom when moving between different screens.
  • The Qt6 Linux build now defaults to X11/XWayland instead of Wayland due to some remaining issues; you can force-enable Wayland with ANKI_WAYLAND=1.
