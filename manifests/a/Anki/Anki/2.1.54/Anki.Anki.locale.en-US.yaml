ShortDescription: Powerful and intelligent flash cards.
Description: |-
  Anki is a program which makes remembering things easy.
  Because it's a lot more efficient than traditional study methods, you can either greatly decrease your time spent studying, or greatly increase the amount you learn.
  Anyone who needs to remember things in their daily life can benefit from Anki.
  Since it is content-agnostic and supports images, audio, videos and scientific markup (via LaTeX), the possibilities are endless.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  A new CSV importer & exporter, thanks to Rumo:
  • Shows a preview based on the selected field separator.
  • Column mapping includes field text for reference.
  • Multiple decks and notetypes can now be imported/exported at once, as columns can be mapped to deck or notetype name.
  • Supports exporting and importing a unique identifier for a note, to use instead of a matching first field. This removes the need for the 'add note id' add-on.
  • Extends the header syntax so that files can specify metadata such as the desired field separator, and the mapping of fields.
  • The new functionality is not enabled by default, and can be enabled with a checkbox in the preferences screen. This also enables
  • the new apkg import/export code introduced in 2.1.52. If you use the Special Fields add-on, you will need to disable this option
  • in order to use the add-on.

  Update to Qt 6.3.1:
  • Fixes complex-language input (eg Japanese, Hindi, etc) on macOS being flaky.
  • Fixes unwanted text when copying from the review screen on Windows.
  • Fixes a startup failure with certain Linux keyboard configurations.
  • Due to a change in Qt, you will need to reconfigure your columns in the browse screen after updating.

  Fixes & improvements:
  • Accept .zip extension when importing add-ons (thanks to Abdo).
  • Add support for getting light/dark mode status with latest freedesktop standard (thanks to Bart).
  • Editor API improvements (thanks to Henrik).
  • Field descriptions in the editor are now shown inline, instead of in a tooltip (thanks to Matthias, Henrik and Hikaru).
  • Fixed a rounding issue when describing time intervals of a year or more.
  • Fixed an error that occurred after a one-way download fetched a collection with a different scheduler version enabled.
  • Fixed desktop hanging when attempting to add a new notetype in KDE (kwin).
  • Fixed flag names not updating after sync until Anki restarted.
  • Fixed inability to enter underscore in tags area on some keyboard layouts (thanks to Henrik).
  • Fixed undo history being cleared and error showing when double-tapping delete in Browse screen.
  • Provide a way for the review screen to support drop events (thanks to Abdo).
  • Other minor fixes and improvements.
