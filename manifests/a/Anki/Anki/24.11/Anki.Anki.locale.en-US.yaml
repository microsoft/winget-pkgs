ShortDescription: Powerful and intelligent flash cards.
Description: |-
  Anki is a program which makes remembering things easy.
  Because it's a lot more efficient than traditional study methods, you can either greatly decrease your time spent studying, or greatly increase the amount you learn.
  Anyone who needs to remember things in their daily life can benefit from Anki.
  Since it is content-agnostic and supports images, audio, videos and scientific markup (via LaTeX), the possibilities are endless.

ReleaseNotes: "What's Changed\nCompatibility\nThe Linux package now requires glibc 2.28+ (2019 Ubuntu/Fedora, and 2021 Debian).New Features\nFSRS\nFSRS has received significant changes in this release, and should be even more\nefficient. It is recommended that you optimize your presets after updating.To avoid errors on older clients, updated parameters will only be visible to\nAnki releases from 24.11 on. Older clients will continue to work, but may\ngive you different scheduling results when reviews are done on them.By @L-M-Sherlock in Other new features:\n- Add FSRS simulator to deck options by @L-M-Sherlock in #3257\n- Add forgetting curve to card info by @L-M-Sherlock in #3437\n- Let FSRS control short term schedule when no (re)learning steps are set. This is experimental. By @L-M-Sherlock in #3375 and #3505 and #3367\nScheduling\n- Load balancing: within your fuzz range, Anki will now try to pick days that have fewer reviews waiting. By @jakeprobst in \n- Easy days: you can now tell Anki to try avoid certain days of the week. By @L-M-Sherlock in #3442\n- Decks can now be sorted by descending retrievability. Simulations have shown this is a better choice\nwhen you have a backlog, and this sort order is likely to become the default in the future.\nStats/Graphs\n- Add true retention stats by @L-M-Sherlock in #3425\n- Estimated total knowledge by note, and daily load by @L-M-Sherlock in #3507\nOther Features\n- Add \"open image\" option to editor by @user1823 in #3431\n- Add an option to show image from editor in folder by @user1823 in #3412\n- Add card position column and always show position in card info by @taylorobyen in #3471\n- Add option for toggling update checks by @voczi in #3346\n- Add revert to backup option to file menu by @taylorobyen in #3434\n- Empty Cards can now be undone by @Arthur-Milchior in #3386\n- If deck options are modified, ask before closing by @Arthur-Milchior in #3410\n- Integrate AnkiHub Sign-in into the preferences screen by @abdnh in \n- Support {{type:nc:...}} to ignore combining characters by @twwn in #3422\nOther Changes\nThis is not a comprehensive list;
