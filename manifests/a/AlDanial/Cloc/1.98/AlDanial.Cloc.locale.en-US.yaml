ShortDescription: cloc counts blank lines, comment lines, and physical lines of source code in many programming languages.
Description: |-
  cloc counts blank lines, comment lines, and physical lines of source code in many programming languages. Given two versions of a code base, cloc can compute differences in blank, comment, and source lines.
  It is written entirely in Perl with no dependencies outside the standard distribution of Perl v5.6 and higher (code from some external modules is embedded within cloc) and so is quite portable.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Added .editorconfig as an INI extension.
  - Added .cppm, .ixx, .ccm, .cxxm, .c++m as C++ extensions.
  - Improved handling of trailing slash with --match-d
  - --exclude-list-file with --git now works as expected.
  - --not-match-d, --not-match-f can now be repeated.
  - --quiet mode is now enabled when STDOUT is not a terminal. This makes for cleaner output when piping to other programs.
  - New switch --include-content=regex to only count files whose content matches the given regex.
  - New switch --only-count-files to only count files.  Counts for blank, comment, and code lines will be zero.
  - --no-recurse now works on Windows
  - Improved exclusion of autogenerated files on Windows.
  - Improved handling of path separators with git in PowerShell.
  - Resolve nondeterministic --diff output.
  - --hide-rate supports all output file types
  - Fixed --diff-list-file with unknown listed file.
  - Fixed parsing of verbose option in the cloc configuration file.
