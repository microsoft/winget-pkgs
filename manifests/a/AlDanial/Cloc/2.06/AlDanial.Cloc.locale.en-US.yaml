ShortDescription: cloc counts blank lines, comment lines, and physical lines of source code in many programming languages.
Description: |-
  cloc counts blank lines, comment lines, and physical lines of source code in many programming languages. Given two versions of a code base, cloc can compute differences in blank, comment, and source lines.
  It is written entirely in Perl with no dependencies outside the standard distribution of Perl v5.6 and higher (code from some external modules is embedded within cloc) and so is quite portable.

  Updates:
  - First attempt at using Github Actions to package a release including making a Windows executable that works with symlinks as used by winget
  - Add column headers for --show-lang and --show-ext output
  - Remove -> separator in --show-ext output
  - Remove leading blank space for --fmt output written to STDOUT
  - New switch --files-from as a synonym for --vcs
  - New switch --ksep/--thousands-delimiter to show a separator (default is a comma) between thousands in output counts
  - Change sequence of Python language filters so that docstrings are handled before #
  - Jenkinsfile now recognized as Groovy
  - Improve Windows/Unix path conflicts when using --git --diff in git-bash terminal
  - New switch --percent as a shortcut to `--by-percent t' to show percentage of totals in blank, comment, code columns
  - Add backtick and C++ style comment support for Svelte
  - Write results in multiple formats if multiple output format switches are given (for example --json --yaml --xml)
  Bug fixes:
  - Remove file irregular"file2.md from the test suite as filenames with embedded double quotes are illegal in Windows and cause git pull problems (among other issues). This file is created dynamically during testing on non-Windows operating systems.
  - On Windows use zip format instead of tar for the 'git archive' command used when running with --git --diff
  - Remove duplicate "percent" entry in options handling
  - Support --exclude-lang in --diff mode
  - Fix --exclude-lang option when used in diff mode and when all files are additions or deletions
  - On Windows, remove temporary SCALAR(0x..) files created when using --fmt
  - Handle --by-file for JSON and YAML outputs with single and double quotes in file names
