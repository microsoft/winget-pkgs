Description: |-
  AdGuard Home is a network-wide software for blocking ads and tracking.
  After you set it up, it’ll cover ALL your home devices, and you don’t need any client-side software for that.
  With the rise of Internet-Of-Things and connected devices, it becomes more and more important to be able to control your whole network.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  The first release of the year is always important — it sets the tone for the months ahead 📆
  The way we kick things off in 2026 may not be flashy, but it’s a solid mix: the new way of handling TLS certificate updates, a couple of other, minor new features, some configuration changes, a couple of key fixes, and the usual security update.
  Stay tuned for more goodies to come!
  Acknowledgments
  A special thanks to our community moderators team and to everyone who filed and inspected issues, added translations, and helped us test this release!
  Full changelog
  See also the v0.107.72 GitHub milestone.
  Security
  - Go version has been updated to prevent the possibility of exploiting the Go vulnerabilities fixed in 1.25.7.
  Added
  - AdGuard Home now tracks the TLS certificate and key files for updates and reloads them after any updates are detected (#3962).
  - New query parameter recent in GET /control/stats/ defines statistics lookback period in millieseconds. See openapi/openapi.yaml for details.
  - New field "ignored_enabled" in GetStatsConfigResponse or GetQueryLogConfigResponse. See openapi/openapi.yaml for details.
  Changed
  - In addition to modifying the contents of a hosts file, deleting or renaming the file now also updates runtime clients and DNS filtering results.
  Configuration changes
  In this release, the schema version has changed from 32 to 33.
  - Added a new boolean field ignored_enabled in querylog and statistics config.
    # BEFORE:
    'querylog':
      # …
      'ignored':
      - '|.^'
    'statistics':
      # …
      'ignored':
      - '|.^'
    # AFTER:
    'querylog':
      # …
      'ignored':
      - '|.^'
      'ignored_enabled': true
    'statistics':
      # …
      'ignored':
      - '|.^'
      'ignored_enabled': true
      ```
    To roll back this change, set the `schema_version` back to `32`.
  Fixed
  - Executable permissions in some Docker installations (#8237).
  - Unknown blocked services from both global and client configuration now logged instead of causing server crash.
