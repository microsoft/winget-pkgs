ReleaseNotes: |-
  Let's get ‚Äúthe usual‚Äù out of the way: we‚Äôve made some security updates, as we always do, and even managed to make do without any bug fixes this time, for better or for worse. But let‚Äôs focus on the main course: new option to enable and disable DNS rewrite rules üö¶
  This was one of the earlier feature requests, and we are happy to finally deliver. You can enable and disable DNS rewrite rules all at once or do so on an individual rewrite basis ‚Äî both by editing YAML files or via UI.
  Acknowledgments
  A special thanks to our community moderators team and to everyone who filed and inspected issues, added translations, and helped us test this release!
