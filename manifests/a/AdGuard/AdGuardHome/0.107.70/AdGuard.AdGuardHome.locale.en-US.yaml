ReleaseNotes: |-
  Even when the update we roll out is on the smaller side, we still aim for some diversity in the changelog. A little bit of vulnerability shore-ups, a smidge of bug fixes, a new thing or two, and a couple generic changes — a tried and tested recipe for a good, solid update 🧑‍🍳
  Acknowledgments
  A special thanks to our community moderators team and to everyone who filed and inspected issues, added translations, and helped us test this release!
