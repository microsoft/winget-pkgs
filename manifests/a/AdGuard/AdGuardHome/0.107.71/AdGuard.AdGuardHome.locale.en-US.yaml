ReleaseNotes: |-
  As it turns out, our changes to optimistic DNS cache in the previous update were a little too optimistic, and we’ve broken it a little bit in the process. This hotfix brings everything back to normal, and, as a bonus, we’re adding new settings for users to manually set the upper age limit and TTL for optimistic cache’s stale answers.
  Acknowledgments
  A special thanks to our community moderators team and to everyone who filed and inspected issues, added translations, and helped us test this release!
  Full changelog
  See also the v0.107.71 GitHub milestone.
  Changed
  - Stale records in optimistic DNS cache now have an upper age limit controlled by dns.cache_optimistic_max_age. The default value is 12 hours.
  - TTL for stale answers from optimistic DNS cache is now controlled by dns.cache_optimistic_answer_ttl. The default value is 30 seconds.
  Configuration changes
  In this release, the schema version has changed from 31 to 32.
  - Added a new string fields dns.cache_optimistic_answer_ttl and dns.cache_optimistic_max_age.
    # BEFORE:
    'dns':
      'cache_enabled': true
      'cache_optimistic': true
      # …
    # AFTER:
    'dns':
      'cache_enabled': true
      'cache_optimistic': true
      'cache_optimistic_answer_ttl': '30s'
      'cache_optimistic_max_age': '12h'
      # …
    To roll back this change, set the schema_version back to 31.
  Fixed
  - Optimistic DNS cache not working (#8148).
