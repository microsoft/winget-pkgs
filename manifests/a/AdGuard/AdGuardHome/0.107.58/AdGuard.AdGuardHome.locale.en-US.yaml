ReleaseNotes: |-
  Hereâ€™s a philosophical question for you: if a release contains more bugfixes than usual, is it good or is it bad? ðŸ¤”
  Luckily, we are developers and not philosophers, so letâ€™s state some facts and leave thought experiments to those wiser than us. And the facts are, we've fixed a bunch of bugs in this update, but also added a neat little feature that we'd like to elaborate on.
  An improved tool to check DNS queries
  If you are serious about protecting your privacy and dealing with ads, chances are you have loads of rules, both as filter lists and as parts of a custom ruleset. Now, any time you're tweaking your filter arsenal, there is an easy way to check if a certain DNS query will be blocked. We've built upon the already-existing tool and added options to indicate DNS record type and specific client, either by IP address or by ClientID. Enter the information and behold all the rules that match your request. Bonus feature: you can unblock any domain right then and there. Happy blocking!
