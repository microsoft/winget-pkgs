  See also the v0.107.47 GitHub milestone.Security
  - Go version has been updated to prevent the possibility of exploiting the Go vulnerabilities fixed in Go 1.22.2.
  Changed
  - Time Zone Database is now embedded in the binary (#6758).
  - Failed authentication attempts show the originating IP address in the logs, if the request came from a trusted proxy (#5829).
  Deprecated
  - Go 1.22 support.  Future versions will require at least Go 1.23 to build.
  - Currently, AdGuard Home uses a best-effort algorithm to fix invalid IDs of filtering-rule lists on startup. This feature is deprecated, and invalid IDs will cause errors on startup in a future version.
  - Node.JS 16. Future versions will require at least Node.JS 18 to build.
  Fixed
  - Resetting DNS upstream mode when applying unrelated settings (#6851).
  - Symbolic links to the configuration file begin replaced by a copy of the real file upon startup on FreeBSD (#6717).
  Removed
  - Go 1.21 support.
