  See also the v0.107.45 GitHub milestone.Security
  - Go version has been updated to prevent the possibility of exploiting the Go vulnerabilities fixed in Go 1.21.8.
  Added
  - Context menu item in the Query Log to add a Client to the Persistent client list (#6679).
  Changed
  - Starting with this release our scripts are using Go's forward compatibility mechanism for updating the Go version.Important note for porters:  This change means that if your go version is 1.21+ but is different from the one required by AdGuard Home, the go tool will automatically download the required version.If you want to use the version installed on your builder, run:

  go get go@$YOUR_VERSION
  go mod tidy

  and call make with GOTOOLCHAIN=local.
  Deprecated
  - Go 1.21 support.  Future versions will require at least Go 1.22 to build.
  Fixed
  - Missing IP addresses in logs when querying for domain names from the ignore lists.
  - Blank page after resetting access clients (#6634).
  - Wrong algorithm for caching bootstrapped upstream addresses (#6723).
  Removed
  - Go 1.20 support, as it has reached end of life.
