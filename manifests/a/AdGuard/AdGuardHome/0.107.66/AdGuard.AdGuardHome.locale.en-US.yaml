ShortDescription: AdGuard Home is a network-wide software for blocking ads and tracking.
Description: |-
  AdGuard Home is a network-wide software for blocking ads and tracking.
  After you set it up, it’ll cover ALL your home devices, and you don’t need any client-side software for that.
  With the rise of Internet-Of-Things and connected devices, it becomes more and more important to be able to control your whole network.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  You may have the best software in the world, but if people can't access it, it's as good as useless. This is why in today's update we made it a priority to fix a couple of authentication errors — so that you can always log in and use AdGuard Home to its fullest. Couple it with the usual security updates and a pinch of other changes, and you have v0.107.66 on your hands! 🙌
  Acknowledgments
  A special thanks to our open-source contributor @bakito, our community moderators team and to everyone who filed and inspected issues, added translations, and helped us test this release!
  Full changelog
  See also the v0.107.66 GitHub milestone.
  Security
  - Go version has been updated to prevent the possibility of exploiting the Go vulnerabilities fixed in 1.25.1.
  Changed
  - Our snap package now uses the core24 image as its base.
  - Outgoing HTTP requests now use the User-Agent header AdGuardHome/v0.107.66 (where v0.107.66 is the current version) instead of Go-http-client/1.1 (#7979).
  Fixed
  - Authentication errors in the Web UI when AdGuard Home is behind a proxy that sets Basic Auth headers (#7987).
  - The HTTP API GET /control/profile endpoint failing when no users were configured (#7985).
  - Missing warning on the Encryption Settings page when using a certificate without an IP address.
