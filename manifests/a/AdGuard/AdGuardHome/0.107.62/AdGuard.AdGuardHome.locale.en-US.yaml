ReleaseNotes: |-
  Many claim to be client-oriented; we're proud to say that AdGuard Home is $client-oriented, as in this update we've fixed (among others) the bug that prevented the rules containing the client modifier from working. ðŸ‘¥
  We have also improved AdGuard Home's security by updating the Go version to shore up some vulnerabilities, as usual.
