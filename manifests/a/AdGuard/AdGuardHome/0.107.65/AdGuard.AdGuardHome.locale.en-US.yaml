  Full changelog
  See also the v0.107.65 GitHub milestone.
  Security
  - Go version has been updated to prevent the possibility of exploiting the Go vulnerabilities fixed in 1.24.6.
  Added
  - A separate checkbox in the Web UI to enable or disable the global DNS response cache without losing the configured cache size.
  - A new "cache_enabled" field to the HTTP API (GET /control/dns_info and POST /control/dns_config). See openapi/openapi.yaml for the full description.
  Changed
  Configuration changes
  In this release, the schema version has changed from 29 to 30.
  - Added a new boolean field dns.cache_enabled to the configuration. This field explicitly controls whether DNS caching is enabled, replacing the previous implicit logic based on dns.cache_size.
    # BEFORE:
    'dns':
        # ‚Ä¶
        'cache_size': 123456
    # AFTER:
    'dns':
        # ‚Ä¶
        'cache_enabled': true
        'cache_size': 123456
    To roll back this change, set the schema_version back to 29.
  Fixed
  - Disabled state of Top clients action button in web UI (#7923).
