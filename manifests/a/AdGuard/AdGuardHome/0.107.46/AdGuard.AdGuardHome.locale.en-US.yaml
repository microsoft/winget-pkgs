  - Ability to disable the use of system hosts file information for query resolution (#6610).
  - Ability to define custom directories for storage of query log files and statistics (#5992).
  Changed
  - Private rDNS resolution (dns.use_private_ptr_resolvers in YAML configuration) now requires a valid "Private reverse DNS servers", when enabled (#6820).NOTE: Disabling private rDNS resolution behaves effectively the same as if no private reverse DNS servers provided by user and by the OS.

  - Missing "served from cache" label on long DNS server strings (#6740).
  - Incorrect tracking of the system hosts file's changes (#6711).
