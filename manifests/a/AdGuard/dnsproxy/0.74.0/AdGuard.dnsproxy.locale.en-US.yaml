ReleaseNotes: |-
  [!WARNING]
  The release contains a bug related to resolving the system hosts file (#430).
  [!IMPORTANT]
  On Unix systems, add the initial separator / when specifying the path for the hosts file. For example, if you previously had --hosts-files=home/user/hosts.txt, use --hosts-files=/home/user/hosts.txt.
  Changed
  - The command-line flag --hosts-files, which previously required a relative file path location from the root, now supports both absolute path and paths relative to the current directory.  --hosts-files=path/to/file is now interpreted relative to the current working directory as opposed to relative to the root (#418).
