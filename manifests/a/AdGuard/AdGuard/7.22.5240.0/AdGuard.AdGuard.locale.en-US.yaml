ReleaseNotes: |-
  In this hotfix, we’re automatically migrating all users from the outdated TDI driver to the more reliable WFP driver. This change comes as a solution to an issue reported by users, ensuring filtering works with the latest versions of Chrome-based browsers, which aren’t fully compatible with TDI.
  TDI isn’t going away completely — you can still enable it if you want to. But if you do, the app will show you a clear warning explaining the potential issues and how to temporarily fix them. For all the details, check out our Knowledge Base.
