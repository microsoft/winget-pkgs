ReleaseNotes: |-
  This update brings exciting improvements to make your AdGuard experience even better: you now get more customization with our improved userscript compatibility. Behind this change is CoreLibs v1.19, AdGuard’s filtering engine and technical core. Although not strictly tied to this release, we also have something worth celebrating: AdGuard is now available in the Microsoft Store, making installation more convenient and, we dare say, easier than ever.
  Improved userscript compatibility
  Some userscripts are designed to work on Single Page Applications (SPAs), such as YouTube. Until now, these scripts often failed to load correctly: if a user opened YouTube’s homepage first, the script wouldn’t inject, and it wouldn’t trigger when navigating to other pages where it was supposed to work. With this update, AdGuard fixes that limitation by ensuring such scripts are properly executed across SPA websites, making AdGuard even more flexible for advanced customization options. This enhancement also allows us to confidently recommend useful tools like the SponsorBlock userscript, which automatically skips sponsored segments in YouTube videos. To try it out:
  1. Go to https://mchangrh.github.io/sb.js/.
  2. Click Generate link.
  3. Copy the link that appears.
  4. Open AdGuard and go to Extensions → Add extension → Import from file or URL.
  5. Paste the copied link and confirm.
  AdGuard is now in the Microsoft Store
  You can now download AdGuard directly from the Microsoft Store, making it quick and secure to install, update, and manage alongside your other apps. Subscriptions and payments are still handled directly through AdGuard’s website, ensuring flexibility and full control over your license. Product updates for builds downloaded from the Microsoft Store will work the same way as in the regular builds. In other words, the store version is simply a new distribution channel, and the update process remains unchanged.
  Support for Comet browser
  We’ve added full compatibility for Perplexity’s Comet browser. Now you can now enjoy the same reliable ad blocking and privacy protection in Comet as you do in other supported browsers.
