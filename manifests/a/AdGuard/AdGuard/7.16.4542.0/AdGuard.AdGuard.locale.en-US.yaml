ReleaseNotes: |-
  What number is the answer to the question of life, the universe, and everything? Frankly, no clue, but AdGuard v7.16 for Windows is all about 64. We’re excited to announce that our app is now compatible with 64-bit systems.
  What does it mean?
  Well, most Windows computers nowadays are 64-bit, they have more resources such as processing power and memory than their 32-bit predecessors. AdGuard has been loyal to the 32-bit version, but progress marches on. It’s time to embrace 64-bit compatibility, which we hope will lead to a more responsive experience for our users and make turning filters on and off feel like pure magic.
  But AdGuard still works on 32-bit computers, right?
  The trusty 32-bit machines will not be forgotten. You won’t need to download a separate installer: our system will automatically detect your computer’s bitness, allowing you to install the appropriate version.
  Anything new with filtering in this version?
  Of course! Another big change is that we have improved HTML filtering. We’ve added support for selectors in HTML filtering rules, which helps block ads more effectively.
  OK, what else you’ve got?
  Our latest DnsLibs brings a new feature to AdGuard for Windows: basic HTTP authentication. Why is this useful? Those who use the DNS-over-HTTPS protocol also benefit from the features of the HTTP protocol. For instance, when using DoH, you have an authentication option that standard DNS servers simply do not have. But what if you have a custom DNS server and you want to restrict access to it? Surely you can do it by restricting access by IP address. However, mobile devices, for example, change networks frequently. How to deal with that? This is where HTTP authentication support comes in. Using this feature in AdGuard for Windows, you can include authentication information to connect to a custom DNS server.
  This feature is currently not available in AdGuard Home and AdGuard DNS, but you will be the first to know when it is!
  Surely that’s it, right?
  We haven't finished yet. When it comes to HTTPS filtering, it can be difficult to сheck the original domain certificate. We’ve covered this issue in our Knowledge base. While AdGuard does (always!) verify validity, you might want to check it yourself. To make HTTPS filtering more transparent for users, AdGuard now offers an option to view the original certificate in “Filtering log”. Here, you can check the details of any web request, see what kind of encryption AdGuard has used, and view the original certificate.Filtering log *mobileAs you can see from the massive changelog, we haven’t been idle since the last release. We haven’t left the WFP and TDI drivers behind either: they’ve been freshly updated. Anyway, let’s cut the talking and go straight to updating!
