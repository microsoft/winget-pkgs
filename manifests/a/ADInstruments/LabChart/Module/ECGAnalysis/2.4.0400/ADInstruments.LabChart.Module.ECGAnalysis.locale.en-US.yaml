  Changes Since Previous Version
  There have been various enhancements and changes to the following:
  - With very large numbers of events (more than about 16000), adding the Table View contents to the Data Pad now copies the whole of the Table View contents and summary information, not just the first 16000 rows. The amount of data that can be added is limited by the amount of available memory on the PC
  - An ECG Analysis v1 licence is now accepted for ECG Analysis v2, even where the evaluation limit has been exceeded
  - The ECG Analysis Table View now includes a help button.
