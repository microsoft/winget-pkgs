ShortDescription: Recover deleted partitions
Description: Partition Find & Mount implements a new concept of deleted or lost partition recovery. It works in the most convenient way possible â€” by locating and mounting partitions into the system, thus making those lost partitions available to you like any generic disk volume. Partition Find & Mount will also work in case any Boot Record (including the Master Boot Record) is missing, damaged or overwritten.
