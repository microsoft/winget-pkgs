  【Major Update】Group & Order:
  Managing tasks becomes troublesome as the number of tasks increases. Now, choose "Group" and "Order" to create more combinations, which makes management easier.
  Want to find important tasks in the near future? Group tasks by time and then order by priority. Want to view the upcoming tasks in different sections? Group tasks by custom and then order by time.
  How to use: Tap "Sort" icon to switch on any list.
