Description: |-
  Auslogics File Recovery can restore deleted files you thought were lost for good. It works with hard drives, USB storage drives, and memory cards, retrieves all file types, even from lost partitions, and supports file recovery from ALL major file systems: NTFS, FAT16/32, and exFAT, making it a powerful tool in your arsenal.

  You don’t need to go through hundreds of deleted files to find the items you want to restore. Filter by date, size, file type, a combination of these options, or just select a file by name. When file names don’t tell you much, you can preview photos, videos, documents, and PDF files right from the search results window and only undelete the files you want.

  You may think that once your disk partition is no longer there on the drive list, recovering data from it will be impossible. That may be true with other tools, but not with Auslogics! The partition recovery feature makes it possible to get back files from a lost partition on your hard drive, even after it gets reallocated or quick-formatted.

  If you can recover deleted files, so can somebody else. The powerful built-in File Shredder tool lets you permanently delete confidential files and prevent their unauthorized recovery. This is especially useful when you share your computer with other people, before you sell or give away your PC, or when you believe your system may be at risk of getting hacked.
