  SSD Optimizer is a dedicated tool designed specifically to maximize the efficiency of your solid-state drive and elevate its performance to another level.

  Enjoy essential options that allow you to optimize drive maintenance, file and system core operations, as well as system services. SSD optimization helps reduce the number of write operations and extend the drive’s service life.

  SSD drives tend to be smaller in size than HDDs, which is why it is especially important to keep files on them sorted and cleaned up on a regular basis. Disk Explorer lets you find the biggest space hogs and move them to another storage device, allowing you to get more storage for more important files.

  SSD Optimizer allows you to check your SSD health, view the amount of data being read from and written to your SSD drive, and access other real-time data on the drive’s status. Choose the time period to display the stats for and see the drive’s estimated service life.

  SSD Optimizer allows you to customize the frequency and timing of scheduled optimization to suit your needs. By scheduling optimization, you can ensure that your SSD remains in optimal condition without the need for constant monitoring.

  With SSD Optimizer, you can clean up junk on your drive before running optimization, so that less data is being moved around during the operation.
