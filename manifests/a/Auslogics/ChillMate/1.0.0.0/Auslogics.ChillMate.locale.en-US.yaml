  ChillMate knows how to stop a laptop from overheating and offers a revolutionary way to keep CPU temperature down. With this smart tool, you no longer need to resort to complex measures like registry tweaking, undervolting, or underclocking, which carry the risk of voiding CPU warranties.

  Unleash your PC battery’s full potential. ChillMate offers advanced tools for extending your battery life by providing control over your laptop’s power consumption. Enjoy optimized usage and help your laptop battery last longer with ChillMate.

  With higher CPU temperature, your PC’s fans start working double duty. Instead of trying to learn how to lower CPU temp on your own, let ChillMate come to the rescue. It allows you to reduce annoying laptop fan noise by customizing optimization profiles, adjusting related settings, and effectively lowering the temperature of your PC’s components.

  Customize your laptop’s performance with ease. Switch between preset Game, Office, Default, Outdoor, or Browsing profiles or create your own. Tell ChillMate how you plan to use your PC, and it will apply its magic powers to keep your laptop cool and quiet in any situation.

  The 8-hour trial period refers to 8 hours of operation with the optimization mechanism enabled, not total utility operation time.
