ReleaseNotes: |-
  Features
  - [BREAKING CHANGE] Added file based settings.
    Added file based configuration system for settings. Now you can move or sync Penpot Desktop’s settings between devices, share it with a team, or include in a back-up.
    Settings are held in a human-readable, settings.json file. The directory with an application's user files is specific to an operating system and its configuration, but you can read about the default setup in Electron's documentation - see userData path for app.getPath method.
    ⚠️ It is a breaking change. After the upgrade, the settings will have default values and you will need to set them back to the preferred ones.
  Fixes
  - [Flathub] Fixed file selector dialog to use portals. By @Beryesa.
    Electron v34 restored portals for file selector dialog. The Flathub version of Penpot Desktop will no longer require access to Downloads and Documents directories.
  Internal
  - Added dependencies update automation.
    Configured Dependabot for automatic dependency updates. Suggested in #54.
