  Features
  - Added local instance creator.
    ‚ö†Ô∏è This feature is experimental. For production-critical work, please use the manual setup guide.
    üì¢ Unfortunately, I‚Äôm unable to test this feature on Windows. I would appreciate any reports on if and how it's working on this operating system.
    Added an automated setup for local Penpot installation, based on the official Docker method for self-hosting Penpot. After you fill a short form, with an instance label and your preferences regarding analytics, Penpot Desktop will set up a local instance of Penpot on your machine. Once the instance is up and running, you will see it available in the app, communicated through an in-app notification and reflected in the user interface.
    For full documentation on the local instance creator, please refer to the Selfhost documentation entry.
