ReleaseNotes: |-
  Fixes
  - Fixed top bar spacing with native title bar enabled #157, #160
    Fixed the top bar to use the space freed by the window controls when the native title bar is enabled.
  - [Linux] Fixed the app to run with Gnome #158
    Version 36 of Electron introduced a breaking change (inherited from its Chrome update) by setting GTK version 4 as the default. This fix implements a workaround to use the GTK v3.
