ReleaseNotes: |-
  Features
  - Added batch download of projects. #172

  Fixes
  - Fixed instance creator to show only the most relevant alert. #169
    Resolves the case when the missing Docker alert is shown together with the sandbox environment alert. A sandbox environment doesnâ€™t have access to Docker, making the instruction to install it misleading.
