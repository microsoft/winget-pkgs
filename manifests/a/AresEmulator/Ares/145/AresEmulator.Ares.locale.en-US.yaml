  - (Temporarily) Remove the recompiler: one will be re-added once accuracy is more up to scratch
  Application / Misc.
  - Core threading improvements have been made to ares, which should lead to increased UI responsiveness and potentially improved performance on some platforms.
  - Added a selector for region fallback preference when loading a title, to better account for cases where the ROM does not support the user’s primary region preference.
  - The status bar will now show the loaded system configuration and region.
  - Fixed an issue where nall::set::insert could fail silently
  - Resolved an invalid version issue when building ares from a source archive
  - Releases now contain platform-appropriate application version metadata
