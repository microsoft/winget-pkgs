ReleaseNotes: |-
  At First
  - New Workspace Update Warning!!
  - Why ‚ÄúProgressive Web Apps‚Äù feature only can be used on Windows?
  üåü What‚Äôs new!
  - Say hello to new workspaces!
    Re-implemented workspace take us to more productivity.
  - The workspace now works in multiple windows, and all windows are separated.
  - Workspace toolbar buttons are now movable.
    This allows you to use the workspace feature wherever you like.
  - Workspaces are enabled by default.
    However, when there is less than one workspace, it no longer interferes with the display/hide of tabs, making it compatible with extensions.
  - Made some improvements to popups for workspace management.
  - Added icons to the context menu for moving tabs between workspaces, and improved appearance.
  - When you create a new workspace based on your feedback, Floorp will provide a workspace name for users, such as ‚ÄúNew Workspace,‚Äù instead of deciding on a name first.
  - Improved workspace‚Äôs toolbar button‚Äôs popup design.
  - The design of the popup used when renaming a workspace has been improved.
  - We remove all restrictions on characters that can be used in workspace name, and you can now use all characters, including emojis and symbols, as described above image.
  - The design of the workspace icon has been adjusted to make it easier to see!
    Thanks:@CutterKnife_
  - We‚Äôve changed the location of workspace settings and added a new workspace tab to the sidebar on Preferences page.
  - We‚Äôve changed the technology we use around tabs in PWA and Split View to improve performance.
    Additionally, PWA detection behavior is now more accurate.
  ‚ùå Fixed
  - Resolves the issue where vertical tabs become unscrollable or stutter.
