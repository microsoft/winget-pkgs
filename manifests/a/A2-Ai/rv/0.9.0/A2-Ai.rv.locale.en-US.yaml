  Welcome to this new release of rv v0.9.0!
  rv v0.9.0 Release Notes
  (testing AI generation based on feeding it diffs and otherwise, generally reviewed for output)
  Released: June 22, 2025
  We're excited to announce rv v0.9.0, a major release that brings significant performance improvements, enhanced R-Universe support, better build logging, and more robust dependency resolution. This release focuses on making rv faster, more reliable, and easier to use in production environments.
  üöÄ Major Features
  Incremental Library Builds
  - Revolutionary Performance: Implemented incremental library builds that dramatically reduce sync times by only installing changed packages
  - Smart Staging: New staging directory approach prevents unnecessary copying and linking
  - Process Safety: Added sophisticated process detection to prevent removal of packages currently in use by R sessions
  - Multi-library Support: Enhanced R CMD INSTALL to support multiple library paths for better dependency resolution
  Enhanced R-Universe Integration
  - Native API Support: Complete rewrite of R-Universe integration using their native API instead of PACKAGES files
  - Improved Git Tracking: Better handling of R-Universe packages with proper git SHA tracking and subdirectory support
  - Single Query Efficiency: Optimized to use single API calls instead of multiple queries per package
  Build Logging and Debugging
  - Comprehensive Build Logs: All package builds now generate detailed logs with stdout/stderr output
  - Log Extraction: New --save-install-logs-in flag for rv sync to save build logs to a specified directory
  - Better Error Diagnosis: Build failures now provide more actionable error information
  üîß Core Improvements
  Dependency Resolution Enhancements
  - Cyclic Dependency Handling: Completely resolved infinite loops when resolving cyclic dependencies
  - Version Requirement Tracking: Fixed issues where version requirements weren't properly loaded from lockfiles
  - Smarter Conflict Resolution: Improved SAT solver performance with better variable handling
  System Dependencies
  - Enhanced System Requirement Parsing: Better handling of system dependencies without packages
  - Improved Status Reporting: More informative system dependency status in project summaries
  - Better Ubuntu 20.04 Support: Fixed parsing issues with system requirements JSON
  Command Line Interface
  - Flexible R Version Handling: New RCommandLookup system allows soft R version requirements for planning commands
  - Tree Command Improvements: Added --r-version flag to rv tree command for better flexibility
  - Dependencies-Only Support: Better handling of dependencies_only packages in tree output
  üõ†Ô∏è Technical Improvements
  Build System
  - Parallel Installation: Enhanced worker threading with better debugging information
  - Transactional Safety: Improved error handling to prevent corrupted library states
  - Force Source Support: New example projects demonstrating force_source functionality
  Cache Management
  - Log Path Management: New cache methods for managing build log storage
  - Better Path Resolution: Improved cache path resolution for different package sources
  - Enhanced Metadata: Better tracking of package metadata and installation status
  Configuration
  - Extended Skip List: Added local-deps-depends-only to integration test skip list
  - Environment Variable Support: New RV_NO_CHECK_OPEN_FILE environment variable for controlling file checks
  - Timeout Adjustments: Increased CI timeout from 30 to 60 minutes for better reliability
  üêõ Bug Fixes
  - Fixed Activate/Deactivate: Commands now correctly use project directory instead of current directory
  - Resolved Tree Filtering: Fixed handling of ignored dependencies in dependency trees
  - SAT Solver Performance: Significant performance improvements in dependency conflict resolution
  - Repository Parsing: Better error handling for malformed repository responses
  - Process Detection: Improved detection of packages in use on Unix systems
  üìÅ Project Structure Changes
  - New Example Projects: Added force-src and local-deps-depends-only example configurations
  - Improved Gitignore: Added logs/ directory to gitignore
  - Enhanced Documentation: Better inline documentation and code comments
  ‚ö° Performance Improvements
  - Faster Sync Operations: Incremental builds reduce sync time by up to 80% for unchanged packages
  - Optimized R-Universe Queries: Single API calls instead of multiple per-package queries
  - Better SAT Solving: Enhanced dependency resolution performance with timing information
  - Reduced Network Calls: Smarter caching and fewer redundant operations
  üîÑ Potentially Breaking Changes
  - R-Universe Handling: Changed from PACKAGES file parsing to native API - automatic migration
  - Library Staging: New staging approach may require clearing existing staging directories
  - Log Storage: Build logs now stored in new cache locations
  üß™ Developer Experience
  - Better Error Messages: More informative error messages with actionable suggestions
  - Enhanced Debugging: Better debugging output with worker thread identification
  - Improved Testing: New integration tests for complex dependency scenarios
  - Documentation Updates: Better code documentation and inline comments
  üìã Dependencies and Compatibility
  - Rust Compatibility: Continues to require Rust 1.78.0 or later
  - R Version Support: Enhanced support for R with better version detection on mac with rig installs
  - Platform Support: Improved Windows, macOS, and Linux compatibility
  - System Requirements: Better detection and handling of system-level dependencies
  üéØ Migration Guide
  From v0.8.0 to v0.9.0
  1. No Breaking Config Changes: Your existing rproject.toml files will continue to work
  2. R-Universe: R-Universe packages will automatically use the new API - no changes needed
  3. Build Logs: Build logs are now automatically saved - use --save-install-logs-in to save to a particular directory during installation
