ShortDescription: Measuring TCP, UDP and SCTP bandwidth performance.
Description: iperf is a tool for active measurements of the maximum achievable bandwidth on IP networks. It supports tuning of various parameters related to timing, protocols, and buffers. For each test it reports the measured throughput / bitrate, loss, and other parameters.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Notable user-visible changes
  - iperf3 now supports the use of Multi-Path TCP (MPTCPv1) on Linux with the use of the --multipath flag. (PR #1661)
  - iperf3 now supports a --cntl-ka option to enable TCP keepalives on the control connection. (#812, #835, PR #1423)
  - iperf3 now supports the MSG_TRUNC receive option, specified by the --skip-rx-copy. This theoretically improves the rated throughput of tests at high bitrates by not delivering network payload data to userspace. (#1678, PR #1717)
  - A bug that caused the bitrate setting to be ignored when bursts are set, has been fixed. (#1773, #1820, PR #1821, PR #1848)
  - The congestion control protocol setting, if used, is now properly reset between tests. (PR #1812)
  - iperf3 now exits with a non-error 0 exit code if exiting via a SIGTERM, SIGHUP, or SIGINT. (#1009, PR #1829)
  - The current behavior of iperf3 with respect to the -n and -k options is now documented as correct. (#1768, #1775, #596, PR #1800)

  Notable developer-visible changes
  - iperf3 now supports a callback function to get the JSON output strings. (#1711, PR #1798)
  - iperf3 now builds correctly with gcc-15 (#1838, PR #1805)
  - Various memory leaks were fixed (#1881, PR #1823, #1814, PR #1822)
  - A potential segfault crash was fixed (#1807)
  - Improved warning messages when reading malformed JSON messages (PR #1817)
  - The Github CI configuration was changed to use a more up-to-date set of runners (PR #1864)
