ShortDescription: Measuring TCP, UDP and SCTP bandwidth performance.
Description: iperf is a tool for active measurements of the maximum achievable bandwidth on IP networks. It supports tuning of various parameters related to timing, protocols, and buffers. For each test it reports the measured throughput / bitrate, loss, and other parameters.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Notable user-visible changes
  - SECURITY NOTE: Thanks to Leonid Krolle Bi.Zone for discovering a JSON type security vulnerability that caused a segmentation fault in the server. (CVE-2024-53580) This has now been fixed. (PR#1810)
  - UDP packets per second now reports the correct number of packets, by reporting NET_SOFTERROR if there's a EAGAIN/EINTR errno if no data was sent (#1367/PR#1379).
  - Several segmentation faults related to threading were fixed. One where pthread_cancel was called on an improperly initialized thread (#1801), another where threads were being recycled (#1760/PR#1761), and another where threads were improperly handling signals (#1750/PR#1752).
  - A segmentation fault from calling freeaddrinfo with NULL was fixed (PR#1755).
  - Some JSON options were fixed, including checking the size for json_read (PR#1709), but the size limit was removed for received server output (PR#1779).
  - A rcv-timeout error has been fixed. The Nread timeout was hardcoded and timed out before the --rcv-timeout option (PR#1744).
  - There is no longer a limit on the omit time period (#1770/PR#1774).
  - Fixed an output crash under 32-bit big-endian systems (PR#1713).
  - An issue was fixed where CPU utilization was unexpectedly high during limited baud rate tests. The --pacing-timer option was removed, but it is still available in the library (#1741/PR#1743).
  - Add SCTP information to --json output and fixed compile error when SCTP is not supported (#1731).
  - --fq-rate was changed from a uint to a uint64 to allow pacing above 32G. Not yet tested on big-endian systems (PR#1728).

  Notable developer-visible changes
  - Clang compilation failure on Android were fixed (PR#1687).
  - iperf_time_add() was optimizated to improve performance (PR#1742).
  - Debug messages were added when the state changes (PR#1734).
  - To increase performance, the old UDP prot_listener is cleared and removed after each test (PR#1708).
  - A file descriptor leak was closed (PR#1619).
