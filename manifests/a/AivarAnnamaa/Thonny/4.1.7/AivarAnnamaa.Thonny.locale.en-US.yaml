  Installation instructions
  Windows
  Default Windows installer (thonny-4.1.7.exe) is 64-bit and comes with Python 3.10 -- this means it is suitable only for 64-bit Windows 8.1, 10 and 11. For Windows 7, 8 and for 32-bit Windows 10 use thonny-py38-4.1.7.exe which comes with 32-bit Python 3.8.
  macOS
  thonny-4.1.7.pkg contains Universal2 build of Python 3.10 -- this means it is suitable for both Arm and Intel Macs.
  Linux
  thonny-4.1.7.bash is a script, which downloads and installs thonny-4.1.7-x86_64.tar.gz (with Python 3.10) when run on x86_64 machines. On other platforms it tries to use system python3 (creates a virtual environment for Thonny and installs thonny and its dependencies there)
  Changes since 4.1.6
  - Fix PyPI package search. Thonny now bases search results on the list of 5000 most popular PyPI packages. If you need to install a less popular package, you need to enter the exact name, #3401
  - Allow selecting ESP32-C6 family in esptool dialog, #3363
  - Update org.thonny.Thonny.appdata.xml
  - Update bundled esptool
  - Fix missing dbus-next dependency in Linux
