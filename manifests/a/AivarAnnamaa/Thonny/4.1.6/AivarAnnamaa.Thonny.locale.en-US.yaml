  ## Installation instructions

  ### Windows

  Default Windows installer (thonny-4.1.6.exe) is 64-bit and comes with Python 3.10 -- this means it is suitable only for 64-bit Windows 8.1, 10 and 11. For Windows 7, 8 and for 32-bit Windows 10 use thonny-py38-4.1.6.exe which comes with 32-bit Python 3.8.

  ### macOS

  thonny-4.1.6.pkg contains Universal2 build of Python 3.10 -- this means it is suitable for both Arm and Intel Macs.

  ### Linux

  thonny-4.1.6.bash is a script, which downloads and installs thonny-4.1.6-x86_64.tar.gz (with Python 3.10) when run on x86_64 machines. On other platforms it tries to use system python3 (creates a virtual environment for Thonny and installs thonny and its dependencies there)

  Please note, that version 4.1.5 was published only at PyPI and no binary builds were published for that version.

  ##  Changes since 4.1.4

  - Make macOS installer work in Sequoia, #3283
  - Add more entitlements for macOS app bundle (may fix problems with programs using camera or microphone)

  - Fix handling nulls in PyPI metadata (fixes installing some PyPI packages)
  - Work around dialogs getting stuck after minimizing windows, #3068
  - Fix too eager instrumentation of MicroPython code, #3043
  - Fix installing package from local file
