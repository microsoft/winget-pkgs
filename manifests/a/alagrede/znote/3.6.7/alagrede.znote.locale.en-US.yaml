  🛠 Fixed
  - Fixed an issue where plugins could not be installed when no note was open.
  A quick note ❤️
  Yes… updates have been coming fast lately 😅
  I know it’s been a lot of small releases, but I’m actively refining and improving Znote to make it as smooth and reliable as possible. When I spot something that can be improved, I prefer to fix it quickly rather than let it sit.
  Your feedback truly helps shape the app, and I’m putting a lot of care into making each version better than the last 🚀
