ShortDescription: Automatically switches between the dark and light theme of Windows 10 and Windows 11.
Description: "Automatically switches between the dark and light theme of Windows 10 and Windows 11. Auto Dark Mode helps you to be more productive. Because you shouldn't care about changing Windows settings several times a day. As soon as the sun goes down, we'll take care of everything for you. Because a simple design change would be too boring, Auto Dark Mode is packed with useful functions. For example, we can also change your desktop wallpaper."
