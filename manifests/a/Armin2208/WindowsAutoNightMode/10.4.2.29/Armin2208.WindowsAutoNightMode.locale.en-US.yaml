Description: |-
  Automatically switches between the dark and light theme of Windows 10 and Windows 11.
  Auto Dark Mode helps you to be more productive.
  Because you shouldn't care about changing Windows settings several times a day.
  As soon as the sun goes down, we'll take care of everything for you.
  Because a simple design change would be too boring, Auto Dark Mode is packed with useful functions.
  For example, we can also change your desktop wallpaper.

  Release notes written by @Armin2208
  It's been a long time since we saw each other. In fact, it's been a whole year. Since the last release, we have implemented important bug fixes and have some great news to announce.
  Auto Dark Mode goes ARMto Dark Mode! If you have an ARM based Windows device, Auto Dark Mode now runs natively on it. With all the advantages that come with it, like less battery consumption in the background, which makes your devices last longer. In addition, the app opens faster, and the user interface is much more responsive than before.
  Also, a long awaited bug fix is here. Sometimes Auto Dark Mode reverted the wallpaper to the previous one right after some seconds when two different wallpaper modes were selected. This instance of this bug should be fixed. We're still actively investigating more occurrences of wallpapers reverting.
  All Users installation mode has been removed. It's too much effort to maintain.
  Known limitations
  Auto Dark Mode comes with a few limitations, either due to Windows or because of technical reasons.
  You can find the full list here: List of known limitations
  Changelog (10.4.2.29)
  Full Changelog: 10.4.1.1...10.4.2.29
  New Features
  - Auto Dark Mode now runs natively on ARM based devices! With all the advantages that come with it, like less battery consumption in the background, which makes your devices last longer. In addition, the app opens faster, and the user interface is much more responsive than before.
  - New tray menu option called Try to fix the theme. If you encounter any random theme switch bugs, like a wrong colored taskbar, you can use the option that hopefully fixes this issue. Press & pray.
  Improvements
  - If using slideshows in shuffle mode, Auto Dark Mode will now forward the first image, to ensure always a random picture will appear as desktop background. No more boredom caused by the same old image! #247
  - ADM will now always apply the theme when it starts up, even when the system idle check module is enabled #905
  - Added support for more picture file types, ensuring you can make full use of your full wallpaper collection. #872
  - Improved handling of the grayscale color filter, or as @Spiritreader stated in his commit "colorus filterus fixus". In this case, fewer bugs lead into fewer colors.
  - The DLL files of Auto Dark Mode are now also signed. This is handy for the users of Windows Smart App Control. #871
  - Upgraded to .NET 8.
  Fixes
  - The long awaited bug fix for wallpaper switch is here! Sometimes Auto Dark Mode reverted the wallpaper to the previous one right after some seconds. This shouldn't happen anymore. #800
  - We also fixed a second wallpaper switch issue, where a solid color would be applied, although a picture is set. #805
  - And even more little bug fixes, to improve the reliability with global theme switching in combination with slideshows and multi monitor wallpapers.
  - Fixed an issue where the TimeSwitchModule was triggered right after the BatteryStatusChanged, which leaded into multiple execution of scripts. #787
  - Fixed a rare case on which the startup task couldn't be set. #796
  - Fixed an issue with time sync triggering a theme switch during the lock screen on Windows 10, blocking other events.
  - Fixed an issue causing DWM refresh to occur erroneously twice during theme mode if forced refresh is enabled.
  - Fixed battery event not being checked after enabling the respective setting.
  - Fixed an issue, where if auto switch was disabled and an external switch was made, not all components would refresh properly on reactivation, because their enable-hooks are not called, even though they rely on system state.
