ShortDescription: An agentic IDE that helps you do your best work with features such as specs, steering, and hooks.
Description: Kiro is an agentic IDE that helps you go from prototype to production with spec-driven development. From simple to complex tasks, Kiro works alongside you to turn prompts into detailed specs, then into working code, docs, and tests—so what you build is exactly what you want and ready to share with your team. Kiro’s agents help you solve challenging problems and automate tasks like generating documentation and unit tests. With Kiro, you can build beyond prototypes while being in the driver’s seat every step of the way.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  This release introduces dev server support with background processes, spec context provider and MVP task workflows, enhanced MCP controls, and per prompt usage tracking with notifications.

  Spec MVP Tasks UX
  Choose your development pace during spec creation. When the agent generates tasks, select "Keep optional tasks (faster MVP)" to mark tests and documentation as optional (✱), or "Make all tasks required" for comprehensive coverage from the start. Optional tasks remain visible throughout the workflow, letting you focus on core features first
  Spec Context in Chat
  Video unavailable
  Use #spec in chat to reference your spec files directly. The agent now understands your spec context, providing more accurate responses during development
  Dev server support
  Video unavailable
  Long-running commands like npm run dev, build watchers, and test runners now start in the background automatically. The agent detects these processes, returns control to you immediately, and continues tracking them—no more blocked terminals
  Per prompt credit consumption insights
  Video unavailable
  You can now see how many credits each prompt consumed, right in the chat panel.
  Proactive Usage Notifications
  Get intelligent alerts about your credit usage patterns to help you stay informed and avoid surprises

  Agent Improvements
  - Better Test Coverage: The agent now generates focused, meaningful tests instead of excessive test files, saving you time and credits
  - More Concise Responses: Refined prompts make the agent more direct and to-the-point, reducing extensive summaries
  - Repository Safety: In supervised mode, the agent automatically avoids writing to .git directories, protecting your repository integrity
  User Experience Improvements
  - Enhanced MCP Server Panel: Manage your MCP tools with new interactive controls—enable/disable individual tools, and see success indicators at a glance
  - Cleaner Modal Interactions: Modals now block other keystrokes, allowing only Escape or click-to-close for a more predictable experience
  - Billing Notifications: Access billing options directly from notification settings for easier account management
  - Usage Meter: The status bar usage meter now updates correctly when you sign in or switch accounts
  - Usage Summaries: Prefer minimal feedback? Disable execution usage summaries in settings
  Bug Fixes
  - MCP Server List: Fixed incorrect enabled/disabled status display when scrolling through long server lists
  - Authentication: Improved error handling and reliability for authentication
  - MCP Tool Call Persistence: Fixed issue where switching between sessions would cause MCP tool call approval prompts to disappear when returning to the original session
  - Panel Layout: Removed chat panel from rearrangement destinations to prevent layout conflicts
  - Status Bar Label: Simplified "Report a bug / Suggest an idea" to "Report issue"
