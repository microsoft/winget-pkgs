ShortDescription: An agentic IDE that helps you do your best work with features such as specs, steering, and hooks.
Description: Kiro is an agentic IDE that helps you go from prototype to production with spec-driven development. From simple to complex tasks, Kiro works alongside you to turn prompts into detailed specs, then into working code, docs, and tests—so what you build is exactly what you want and ready to share with your team. Kiro’s agents help you solve challenging problems and automate tasks like generating documentation and unit tests. With Kiro, you can build beyond prototypes while being in the driver’s seat every step of the way.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Includes 0.8.86 patch.

  This release introduces web tools for searching and fetching content from the internet, enhanced hooks with new action types, subagents for parallel task execution, and improved supervised mode with per-file review capabilities.
  Web tools
  Kiro can now search the web and fetch content from URLs directly in chat. Use web tools to look up current documentation, find the latest library versions, or research solutions to technical problems. This keeps your development workflow in one place without switching to a browser.
  Contextual hooks
  Introducing contextual hooks with two new triggers: Prompt Submit and Agent Stop. These hooks fire at key moments in the agent workflow, letting you inject context or run commands before the agent acts. Choose between Agent Prompt actions to instruct the agent with natural language, or Shell Command actions to run commands locally without consuming credits.
  Subagents
  Introducing subagents for parallel task execution. Kiro can now run multiple tasks simultaneously or delegate to specialized subagents. Two built-in subagents are available: a context gatherer for exploring projects and a general-purpose agent for parallelizing tasks. Each subagent has its own context window, keeping the main agent context clean. Use subagents to investigate multiple data sources in parallel, analyze GitHub issues across repositories, or extend your context window limits without requiring summarization.
  Enhanced Supervised Mode
  Supervised mode now offers granular control over code changes with per-file review capabilities. When Kiro makes changes to multiple files, you can review each file individually and selectively accept or reject changes. This turn-based approach works in both vibe chat and spec chat sessions, giving you full visibility into each modification.
  Improvements (7)
  - Terminal - Improved git pager handling to prevent terminal hangs
  - Enterprise auth - Smoother sign-in with cached enterprise auth startURL
  - .kiroignore support - Exclude specific files from agent access using gitignore syntax. Create `.kiroignore` in your project root with patterns for files to skip, then add it to the `agentIgnoreFiles` setting
  - Context Usage - See context window usage percentage in the chat
  - Copy Message - Copy agent responses with a single click using the new copy button
  - Model Dropdown - Press Escape to dismiss the model selection dropdown
  - Spec Rename - Rename specifications directly from the Kiro panel
  Fixes (6)
  - Markdown tables - Fixed rendering of tables in chat messages
  - Chat fonts - Fixed inconsistent font styling in chat
  - Context provider - Fixed context provider and right-aligned dropdown positioning
  - Hook Cancellation - Fixed issue where hook commands couldn't be cancelled
  - Powers - Fixed UI bugs for Kiro Powers panel
  - Enterprise Profiles - Fixed profile switching for subscribed profiles
