ShortDescription: This plugin helps you to use the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) to start and end sessions to your managed instances.
Description: Session Manager is a fully managed AWS Systems Manager capability that lets you manage your Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, on-premises instances and virtual machines. Session Manager provides secure and auditable instance management without the need to open inbound ports. When you use the Session Manager plugin with the AWS CLI to start a session, the plugin builds the WebSocket connection to your managed instances.
