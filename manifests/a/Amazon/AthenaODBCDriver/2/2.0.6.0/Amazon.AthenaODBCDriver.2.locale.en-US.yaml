  Improvements
  - Browser Trusted Identity Propagation authentication plugin – Added a new authentication plugin to support browser-based OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication with trusted identity propagation. This plugin provides a seamless authentication experience by handling the complete OAuth 2.0 flow through your default browser, automatically fetching the JSON Web Token (JWT), and integrating with trusted identity propagation. The plugin is specifically designed for single-user desktop environments. For information on enabling and using trusted identity propagation, see What is trusted identity propagation?.
  - Enhanced logging framework – Significantly improved the driver's logging mechanism by:
    - Introducing more granular log levels beyond basic 0/1 options
    - Removing redundant log statements
    - Optimizing the logging framework to include diagnostically relevant information
    - Addressing performance issues that were causing operational delays
    - Reducing excessive log file generation when logging is enabled
  Fixes
  - Result fetcher optimization – Fixed an issue where fetch size parameter limitations were incorrectly applied to both streaming and non-streaming result fetchers. The limitation is now correctly applied only to non-streaming result fetchers.
