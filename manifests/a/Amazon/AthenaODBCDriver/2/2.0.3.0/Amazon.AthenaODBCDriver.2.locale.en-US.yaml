  Improvements
  - Added MFA support for the Okta authentication plugin on Linux and Mac platforms.
  - Both the athena-odbc.dll library and the AmazonAthenaODBC-2.x.x.x.msi installer for Windows are now signed.
  - Updated the CA certificate cacert.pem file that is installed with the driver.
  - Improved the time required to list tables under Lambda catalogs. For LAMBDA catalog types, the ODBC driver can now submit a SHOW TABLES query to get a list of available tables. For more information, see Use query to list tables.
  - Introduced the UseWCharForStringTypes connection parameter to report string data types using SQL_WCHAR and SQL_WVARCHAR. For more information, see Use WCHAR for string types.
  Fixes
  - Fixed a registry corruption warning that occurred when the Get-OdbcDsn PowerShell tool was used.
  - Updated the parsing logic to handle comments at the start of query strings.
  - Date and timestamp data types now allow zero in the year field.
