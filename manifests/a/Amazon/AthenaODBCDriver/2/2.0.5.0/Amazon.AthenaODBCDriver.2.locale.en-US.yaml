  Improvements
  - JWT Trusted Identity Provider (TIP) authentication plugin – Added a new authentication plugin to support JWT Trusted Identity Provider (TIP) integration with ODBC drivers. This authentication type allows you to use a JSON web token (JWT) obtained from an external identity provider as a connection parameter to authenticate with Athena. With TIP, identity context is added to an IAM role to identify the user requesting access to AWS resources. For information on enabling and using TIP, see What is Trusted Identity Propagation?.
  - Custom SSO admin endpoints support – Added support for custom SSO Admin endpoints in the ODBC driver. This enhancement allows you to specify your own endpoints for SSO services when running ODBC behind VPCs.
  - AWS SDK version update – We have updated the AWS SDK version used in the driver to 2.32.16 and have updated the project dependencies for release 2.0.5.0.
