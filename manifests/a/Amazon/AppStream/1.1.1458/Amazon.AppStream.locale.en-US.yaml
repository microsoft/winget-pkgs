ShortDescription: Secure, reliable, and scalable application streaming
Description: Amazon AppStream 2.0 is a fully managed AWS End User Computing (EUC) service designed to stream software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications and convert desktop applications to SaaS without rewriting code or refactoring the application. With AppStream 2.0, you can quickly scale your applications to users across the globe without having to manage any infrastructure. AppStream 2.0 offers multi-session capability, allowing you to provision multiple user sessions on a single AppStream 2.0 instance. This gives you the ability to optimize resource utilization and helps lower cost, supporting a wide range of user types without over provisioning.
