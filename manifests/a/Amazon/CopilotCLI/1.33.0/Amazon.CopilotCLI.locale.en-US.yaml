  ‚ö°Ô∏è Features and Enhancements
  - run local --use-task-role: Elevate your local testing experience with the ECS Task Role using the new --use-task-role flag (#5529)The copilot run local command now includes a --use-task-role flag. When activated, Copilot will fetch IAM permissions from your deployed service and seamlessly inject them into the containers created by run local. This ensures that your containers mirror the same permissions as they would in the cloud, facilitating more accurate testing.
  If you prefer not to utilize the TaskRole permissions or if Copilot encounters issues retrieving them, you can disable this feature by setting --use-task-role=false.

  - run local depends_on support: Local run containers now respect depends_on in your service manifests (#5509)Enhancing the run local feature! Previously, copilot run local initiated the startup and removal of all containers without a specific order. With this improvement, container actions are aligned with your depends_on configuration in your service manifests.

  - Allow variable escaping in manifest: Escape interpolated variables in your manifests with the latest update (#5516)Now, you have the flexibility to escape interpolated variables in your manifests. Use the following syntax to prevent Copilot from resolving ${name} using the local environment:

  command: echo hello \${name}
  variable:
    name: world



  - run local --watch skips files specified by .dockerignore: --watch flag now respects .dockerignore and Copilot will not watch these files (#5565)
  - Upgrade Lambda Node.js version to 20.x: as Node.js 16 has been End-of-Life since Sep. 2023 (#5583)
  üêõ Bug Fixes
  - Allow decryption of secrets with CMK (#5576): In v1.32.1, a security patch restricted kms:Decrypt to ECS Execution Role and AppRunner Instance Role. This affected users with managed KMS keys. Now, any KMS key with correct copilot-application and copilot-environment tags is allowed for seamless deployment.
  - response_time should respect imported ALB (#5564)
  - Check for ubuntu based distro to install SSM Plugin (#5571)
  - run local --proxy should work when Service Connect is disabled (#5604)
