ShortDescription: Hard disk drive and SSD health inspection tool
Description: GSmartControl is a graphical user interface for smartctl (from smartmontools package), which is a tool for querying and controlling SMART (Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology) data on modern hard disk and solid-state drives. It allows you to inspect the drive's SMART data to determine its health, as well as run various tests on it.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Support GCC 11 (and Ubuntu 22.04) by using and vendoring fmt library (#77).
  - Support an option of saving smartctl output to text instead of JSON (#76).
  - Restored pre-2.0.0 runtime support for smartctl < 7.3 (based on Text parser); this is an unsupported, old method without NVMe, provided for compatibility only (#77).
  - Restored pre-2.0.0 support for standard (non-extended) self-test log found in very old ATA drives; the new JSON parser did not support this previously (#79).
  - Better support for temperature values in JSON parser; this fixes unreasonably large temperature values (#78).
  - Add a tooltip explaining self-test "lifetime hours" wrapping behavior (#73).
  - Windows: Fixed a crash on Windows 7 when opening drive information by using Windows 7-compatible librsvg (#71).
  - Windows: Avoid using non-integer font sizes.
