ShortDescription: Files extractor and reimporter, archives and file formats parser, advanced tool for reverse engineers and power users, and much more.
Description: |-
  QuickBMS uses a minimalistic GUI if the executable is double-clicked (launched normally) or from command-line if launched from the console, by using this second mode or a link to the executable it's possible to activate many useful and advanced options.
  
  Features:
    - open source and multiplatform, tested on Windows (even Win98) and GNU/Linux (x86 and PPC)
    - works from both command-line and GUI (Windows only, just double-click on quickbms.exe)
    - reimport and reimport2 modes for reinjecting the modified files back to the archives
    - support for tons of encryption algorithms, even some proprietary ones
    - support for tons of compression algorithms (over 700), even some proprietary ones
    - support for tons of hashing algorithms
    - support for other types of algorithms (like base64) and/or obfuscations (xor, rot and so on)
    - support for calling DLLs and raw dumped functions with almost any known calling convention
    - support for bits operation and switchable little/big endian
    - simple and dynamic language that allows to make many operations reducing the percentage of archives and formats that can't be supported easily
    - verbose option (-V) that displays all the needed details during reversing and testing of file formats
    - HTML output (-H) that automatically applies colors and names to the fields parsed during the usage of the scripts: example for zip.bms on q3infoboom.zip
    - possibility to use the tool as a blind scanner of compression, encryption and crc/checksum algorithms
    - support for network sockets, SSL and http/https
    - support for other alternative input/output interfaces like processes (included debugging and automatic breakpoint restoring), audio, video and Windows messages
    - support for the visualization and creation of various types of data like x86 assembly, IP addresses, time_t, FILETIME, ClassID and more
    - support for C-like structures and basic syntax for easy handling of file formats
    - support for any command-line decompressor/decrypter/anything_else via the EXECUTE method (Comtype and Encryption commands)
    - read and write operations
    - quickbms_4gb_files.exe is a native 32bit program with all the variables set as 64bit useful in some situations
    - planned future development that will cover more advanced features for reverse engineers and power users
    - customizable CRC engine
    - tons of scripts supporting hundreds of file formats and thousands of games
    - experimental games localization (strings editing)
    - creation of ISO images and ZIP archives as alternative outputs
    - embedded C compiler to use C functions at runtime
    - support for embedded Python and Lua scripts
    - experimental IPC interfaces: named pipes, mailslot, web and dll
    - support for the WCX packer plugins of Total Commander
