  Highlights 🎖️
  The iOS version of Koodo Reader is now available on the App Store. You can search for "koodo reader" to download and install it. Due to Apple's policies, the iOS version only supports email login. If you haven’t previously bound an email, please go to Settings > Account. You can now also upgrade to the Pro version via in-app purchases in the iOS version. If you’ve already purchased the Pro version before, there’s no need to buy it again—simply log in to unlock the Pro features. Future developer version will continue to be distributed via TestFlight, while the App Store will only receive stable updates and urgent bug fixes.
