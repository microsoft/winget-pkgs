  Highlights 🎖️
  Official AI voice is now available on all platforms. The AI voices are generated using Kokoro-82M, an open-source TTS model under the Apache-2.0 license. It supports 8 languages (English, Spanish, French, Hindi, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, and Chinese) and includes 54 realistic, human-like voices. Due to the high cost of AI voice services, this feature is available exclusively to Pro users. A daily quota of 25,000 characters is provided (subject to future adjustments). Additional character quotas can be obtained by purchasing add-on packages.
