ReleaseNotes: |-
  Windows ARM64 beta
  In this release, we added support for Windows ARM64. At this time, it comes with the following caveats:
  - Audacity for WoA requires Windows 11 or later. Windows RT is not supported.
  - Plugins (VST, OpenVINO, etc.) are not supported.
  - It requires an WoA-version of FFmpeg, the regular installer does not work.
  - It was not thoroughly tested with all features and workflows due to a lack of devices – your feedback is welcome.
  Other changes:
  - #8942 Windows on ARM support (Thanks, Vasanth K (@vask2108) and Linaro!)
  - #9121 FLAC importer now supports 32-bit PCM (Thanks, Dr. K. D. Murray (@kdm9)!)
  - #8851 Fixed crash when rendering spectrum view (Thanks, Hailey Somerville (@haileys)!)
  - #9097 Fixed lost focus when registration window was closed
