    Property View
      - The hierarchical view (folders, subfolders) is implemented for various types of model resources.

  Bugfixes

    Material Handling Library
      - Fixed bug: Conveyor spur: The priority logic works incorrectly, allowing items on the conveyor that have a lower priority to squeeze between items with a higher priority.
      - Fixed bug: Path-guided transporters may re-register in the restricted area, causing an internal library error.
      - Fixed bug: The overhead crane doesn't handle an agent if the coordinates of this agent coincide with at least one coordinate of the initial crane bridge position.

    Pedestrian Library
      - Fixed bug: PedChangeLevel block: The pedestrian has incorrect coordinates when moving to the target line located on the same level.

    Process Modeling Library
      - Fixed bug: Wait block: A call of the free(null) function releases all the agents in the block instead of throwing an error.

    Application
      - Fixed bug: The dialogs requesting action from a user could appear hidden behind the splash screen or other windows during the application startup.

    Application, Dialogs and Wizards
      - Fixed bug: A request to the support team can't be sent on macOS if it contains a model as an attachment.

    Converter to Markup
      - Fixed bug: CAD converter creates walls with zero length, making the model run impossible to complete.

    Example Models
      - Fixed bug: Issues with the Probability Distribution model.
