  ## What’s new in AnyLogic 8.9.4 — Mar 5, 2025

  ### Major features

  #### Application

  - You can now start the model with the profiler to analyze the performance of
    functions used in the model, helping you identify bottlenecks and optimize
    execution.
  - A new Favorite palette lets you save frequently used elements from other
    palettes for quick access. It also includes a section with the 10 most recently
    used elements.
  - Agents and Java classes can now be organized into folders within the model,
    making it easier to manage complex projects.

  #### Material Handling Library and Process Modeling Library

  - The TransporterFleet block now supports downtimes, making it easy to simulate
    maintenance, failures, and charging. When the downtime begins, transporters
    pause their tasks and resume when it is over. If a task is urgent enough, it can
    override the downtime. This helps create realistic scenarios where transporters
    occasionally stop for service, just like in real life.
  - It is now possible to automatically send transporters, cranes, and movable
    resources to the maintenance location when downtime is triggered.

  ### Minor features and improvements

  - Application:
    - It is now possible to use Ctrl + click to navigate from the code field to the
      element in another agent.
    - It is now possible to open models in the locally installed AnyLogic from
      documentation links.
  - The mttr() and mtbf() functions are added to collect failure and maintenance event statistics in:
    - the resource and transporter agent types;
    - the ResourcePool and TransporterFleet flowchart blocks;
    - the Conveyor, Station, Jib Crane, Overhead Crane, and Crane Bridge markup
      elements.
  - Material Handling Library:
    - Conveyor: The getUtilization() function is added, as well as the getState()
      function and states.
    - Station: The getUtilization() function is added.
    - Jib Crane: The getState() function and states are added.
  - Process Modeling Library, Material Handling Library:
    - Downtime: Added the On downtime triggered action that occurs when one of the
      triggers is fired or the startTask() function is called.
    - The May preempt other task option of the Service and Seize blocks will no longer
      move the task higher in the task list if it has the same priority as other tasks
      in that list.
  - Pedestrian Library:
    - Behavior of pedestrian crowds was improved.
    - The separate Slope element was removed from the Rectangular Node and Polygonal
      Node markup elements. Now the slope properties are set within the Rectangular
      Node and Polygonal Node themselves.
  - Road Traffic Library:
    - CarMoveTo: The Include roads and Avoid roads properties were added to control
      the route building of the car.
  - Debugger:
    - It is now possible to set an exception breakpoint in the Breakpoints view in the
      debug mode.
    - It is now possible to set a watchpoint in the Java editor.
  - New example models:
    - Transporter Charging System.
    - Using the ALPyne library: Pathfinder, Border Checkpoint Optimization, Stock Management Game.
    - Using the Pypeline library: Supply Chain Optimizer, Simple Hospital (AI
      Testbed), Lorenz Weather Model - Pypeline, Traveling Salesman.

  ### Bugfixes

  - Application: The animation of a custom flowchart block returned to the origin of
    the coordinates during the model runtime.
  - Material Handling Library: In some cases, the agent’s animation remained on the
    conveyor even after the agent had left the conveyor.
  - Material Handling Library: The agent was animated in the wrong location in case
    the transporter picked up the agent from a different space than the one the
    transporter was in.
  - Pedestrian Library: Large pedestrian models could fall with Too many splitting
    iterations while enforcing constraints exception on the model startup.
  - Pedestrian Library: The animation of some pedestrians remained at the location
    of the exiting pedestrian space when the pedestrian passed through the PedExit
    block.
  - 3D Animation: 3D animation of the agent was not displayed when exported as part
    of a custom library and added to another model.
  - Built-in Database: An error could occur if a model contained a large Excel file.
  - Built-in Database: Importing an Excel file could cause a null pointer exception in some cases.
  - Debugger: Breakpoint conditions and hit counters did not work when set in the
    Breakpoints view.
  - Debugger: Breakpoint properties were discarded after the model was built.
  - Debugger: Conditions set at the breakpoint could be lost after restarting the
    model in the debug mode.
  - Debugger: In the stack chart and bar chart, the breakpoint could only be set in
    one value field.
  - Debugger: It was not possible to add a breakpoint on the line of the code field
    without clicking inside the code field.
  - Debugger: Breakpoints were lost after the model was reopened.
  - Export of models and libraries: 3D files and other source files of the model
    were duplicated when exporting the model to AnyLogic Cloud.
  - Property view: Parameters preview: the design elements of the parameter starting section were misplaced.
