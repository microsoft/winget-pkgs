ShortDescription: A fast raw image viewer designed for digital photographers
Description: |-
  FastPictureViewer Professional is a photographer-oriented image viewer: it offers features specific to photo viewing and photographer's workflows (as opposed to general-purpose image viewing). The program was initially created to facilitate the first review pass (aka "culling") that most photographers do on their fresh images to select the "keepers" from the rest (and sometimes delete unwanted images). The software also goes beyond this in its own, unique way. Read on...
  FastPictureViewer Professional (or FPV Pro for short) was designed primarily to...
  - help quickly review many images efficiently (check overall composition, exposure, sharpness...).
  - allow the user to rate and label images according to their subjective "value" (or flag them for deletion).
  - copy, move or delete photos, one by one or in batch, according to the given rating or other criteria.
  - quickly export web-ready small or medium size JPEG copies of some or all of the photos.
  To reach those goals, the program features...
  - professional color management with profiled monitor support.
  - efficient use of computer resources and latest operating systems (ample memory, multiprocessing, 64-bit, optional GPU acceleration).
  - streamlined used interface with 1-keystroke keyboard shortcuts for most core functions.
  FPV Pro also support advanced functions such as tethered shooting, real-time folder monitoring and feature a simple slideshow mode. It can be used in many different scenarios and runs on a wide variety of hardware configurations, ranging from modest "netbooks" with small screens to multi-monitor, multi-processors 64-bit powerhouses. As examples, one of our customers at focusnature.ch told us he successfully culled 6'000 Canon EOS 7D raw files on a portable "netbook PC", in the back of a camping-car during a photo trip. At the other end of the spectrum, FPV Pro is used by many of iStockphoto' photo editors (the largest micro stock photo agency in the world) and help streamline their massive daily digital image reviewing tasks.
