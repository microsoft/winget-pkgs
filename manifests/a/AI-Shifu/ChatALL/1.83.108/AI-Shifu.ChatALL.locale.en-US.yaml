ShortDescription: Chat with ALL AI Bots Concurrently, Discover the Best
Description: "Large Language Models (LLMs) based AI bots are amazing. However, their behavior can be random and different bots excel at different tasks. If you want the best experience, don't try them one by one. ChatALL (Chinese name: 齐叨) can send prompt to several AI bots concurrently, help you to discover the best results. All you need to do is download, install and ask."
