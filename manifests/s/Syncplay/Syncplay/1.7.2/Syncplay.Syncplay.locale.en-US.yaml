ShortDescription: Client/server to synchronize media playback on mpv/VLC/MPC-HC/MPC-BE on many computers
Description: |-
  Syncplay synchronises the position and play state of multiple media players so that the viewers can watch the same thing at the same time.
  This means that when one person pauses/unpauses playback or seeks (jumps position) within their media player then this will be replicated
  across all media players connected to the same server and in the same 'room' (viewing session). When a new person joins they will also be
  synchronised. Syncplay also includes text-based chat so you can discuss a video as you watch it (or you could use third-party Voice over
  IP software to talk over a video).
