ShortDescription: A dotfile manager and templater written in rust.
Description: |-
  Dotter is a dotfile manager and templater.
  Dotfiles are configuration files that usually live in the home directory and start with a dot. Often times, it is desirable to have a backup of all the configurations on your system, which is why a lot of users have their dotfiles saved in a git repository, then symlinking them to their target locations using ln -s.
  However, there are several issues with that barebones approach:
  - Hard to keep track of what comes from where once you have more than a handful of dotfiles
  - Tedious to setup on a new machine - you need to manually create every single link
  - No real way to handle differences between machines - say you want the battery meter on your bar to not appear on your desktop machine
  Dotter aims to solve all those problems by providing a flexible configuration and automatic templating or symlinking to the target locations.
