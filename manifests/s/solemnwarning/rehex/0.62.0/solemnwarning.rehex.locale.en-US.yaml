ShortDescription: Reverse Engineers' Hex Editor
ReleaseNotes: |-
  This release includes changes and new features to assist editing of sub-byte-width values and non-byte-aligned values in files:
  - Add bit array data type (#167).
  - Allow selecting and setting comments/highlights/types on bit-sized/aligned quantities, not just byte-aligned (#155).
  - Allow defining arbitrary integer types, up to 64 bits wide (#215).
  - Allow navigating hex data by nibbles rather than bytes (#58).
  There are also improvements to the highlighting feature, and general usability improvements:
  - Allow colouring data by byte value (#223).
  - Allow changing/defining custom highlight colours and assigning labels to them (#227).
  - Use dimmer highlight colours for dark colour schemes (#227).
  - Save highlight colours/labels per-file (#60).
  - Allow changing keyboard shortcuts (#226).
  - Add Shift+Enter shortcut for "OK" in the comment dialog (#226).
  - Display offset in both decimal and hexadecimal in status bar (#228).
  - Fix handling of relative paths specified on the command line when opening in an existing instance (#237).
  On the build/pipeline side, I've switched the toolchain used for the 32-bit Windows version (rehex-0.62.0-win-x86.zip) to one that can run on earlier versions of Windows (XP and above).
