  Exchange migration tool that automates the complex and time-consuming process of manual migration. This tool offers error-free solution to migrate Exchange mailboxes with zero data loss and minimal downtime. The tool also provides, real-time tracking, delta migration and public folder migration for business continuity.
  - Migrate primary, archive, public folders to Exchange Server or Office 365
  - Auto-match source and target mailboxes or uses CSV for custom mapping
  - Ensure data integrity with customizable filters and date-based selection

  If you are using Microsoftâ€™s native tool for cross-domain migration, you need to establish a trust relationship between Active Directory forests. Stellar Migrator for Exchange eliminates this complex setup, allowing direct cross-forest and cross-domain migrations using IP addresses and server credentials.

  Manual migration methods require mapping mailboxes on the source server to the mailboxes on the target server manually. This process takes a lot of time when you are dealing with various mailboxes. If you use Stellar Migrator for Exchange, you can use the auto-mailbox matching feature to simply map the mailboxes using mailbox ID.

  Stellar Migrator for Exchange facilitates the migration of mailboxes and public folders between Exchange servers and from on-premises Exchange environments to Microsoft 365 environments. It ensures data integrity and minimal downtime during the migration process.
