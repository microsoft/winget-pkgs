ReleaseNotes: |-
  Installation
  To install sops, download one of the pre-built binaries provided for your platform from the artifacts attached to this release.
  For instance, if you are using Linux on an AMD64 architecture:
  # Download the binary
  curl -LO https://github.com/getsops/sops/releases/download/v3.11.0/sops-v3.11.0.linux.amd64
  # Move the binary in to your PATH
  mv sops-v3.11.0.linux.amd64 /usr/local/bin/sops
  # Make the binary executable
  chmod +x /usr/local/bin/sops
  Verify checksums file signature
  The checksums file provided within the artifacts attached to this release is signed using Cosign with GitHub OIDC. To validate the signature of this file, run the following commands:
  # Download the checksums file, certificate and signature
  curl -LO https://github.com/getsops/sops/releases/download/v3.11.0/sops-v3.11.0.checksums.txt
  curl -LO https://github.com/getsops/sops/releases/download/v3.11.0/sops-v3.11.0.checksums.pem
  curl -LO https://github.com/getsops/sops/releases/download/v3.11.0/sops-v3.11.0.checksums.sig
  # Verify the checksums file
  cosign verify-blob sops-v3.11.0.checksums.txt \
    --certificate sops-v3.11.0.checksums.pem \
    --signature sops-v3.11.0.checksums.sig \
    --certificate-identity-regexp=https://github.com/getsops \
    --certificate-oidc-issuer=https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com
  Verify binary integrity
  To verify the integrity of the downloaded binary, you can utilize the checksums file after having validated its signature:
  # Verify the binary using the checksums file
  sha256sum -c sops-v3.11.0.checksums.txt --ignore-missing
  Verify artifact provenance
  The SLSA provenance of the binaries, packages, and SBOMs can be found within the artifacts associated with this release. It is presented through an in-toto link metadata file named sops-v3.11.0.intoto.jsonl. To verify the provenance of an artifact, you can utilize the slsa-verifier tool:
  # Download the metadata file
  curl -LO  https://github.com/getsops/sops/releases/download/v3.11.0/sops-v3.11.0.intoto.jsonl
  # Verify the provenance of the artifact
  slsa-verifier verify-artifact <artifact> \
    --provenance-path sops-v3.11.0.intoto.jsonl \
    --source-uri github.com/getsops/sops \
    --source-tag v3.11.0
  Container Images
  The sops binaries are also available as container images, based on Debian (slim) and Alpine Linux. The Debian-based container images include any dependencies which may be required to make use of certain key services, such as GnuPG, AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault, and Google Cloud KMS. The Alpine-based container images are smaller in size, but do not include these dependencies.
  These container images are available for the following architectures: linux/amd64 and linux/arm64.
  GitHub Container Registry
  - ghcr.io/getsops/sops:v3.11.0

  Quay.io
  - quay.io/getsops/sops:v3.11.0
  - quay.io/getsops/sops:v3.11.0-alpine
  Verify container image signature
  The container images are signed using Cosign with GitHub OIDC. To validate the signature of an image, run the following command:
  cosign verify ghcr.io/getsops/sops:v3.11.0 \
    --certificate-identity-regexp=https://github.com/getsops \
    --certificate-oidc-issuer=https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
    -o text
  Verify container image provenance
  The container images include SLSA provenance attestations. For more information around the verification of this, please refer to the slsa-verifier documentation.
