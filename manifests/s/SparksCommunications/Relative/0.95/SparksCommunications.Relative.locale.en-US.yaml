ShortDescription: Relative lets you create relative shortcuts in Windows. As the name implies, relative shortcuts can be moved along with their parent directory tree and still point to the same location within the tree.
Moniker: relative
InstallationNotes: If you move the shortcut file or the target file, the shortcut obviously won't work. You can modify the shortcut path from its Properties panel, but it's usually easier to create a new one.
