    - Configurable anti-flood protection for servers that do not advertise SAFERATE
    - Channel modes will be retrieved on joining a channel (to be shown in the pane title bar)
    - Display own nickname next to text input field
    - Server messages can be dimmed (enabled by default), to lessen their visual impact relative to user messages
    - Context menu to timestamps that shows the message date, and will copy the timestamp to the clipboard when clicked

  Fixed:

    - The primary clipboard (with copy on selection & paste with middle click) is supported on Linux
    - Sound effects are now properly reloaded when config file is refreshed from within the application
    - Filters are applied only to the server they are specified for
    - Filters are renormalized properly when ISUPPORT is updated
    - Crash when typing /bouncer into the message box
    - Scroll state no longer changes rapidly when long previews for URL(s) are present in history
    - Sidebar menu always takes one click to open (would sometimes require two clicks)

  Changed:

    - The logs pane will only contain log messages since the last of launch of Halloy (i.e. for the current session only)
    - Always show version number in user menu
