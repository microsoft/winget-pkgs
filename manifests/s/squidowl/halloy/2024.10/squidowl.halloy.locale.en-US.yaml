ReleaseNotes: |-
  Added:
    - Small icon in sidemenu when a new release is available
    - Enable support for IRCv3 chghost, account-notify, and extended-join

  Removed:
    - Persistent window position and size due to an upstream bug

  NOTE
    - Due to a bug in an upstream library that affected Windows, we had to release an update earlier than planned. As a result, this update contains fewer changes than a typical release.
