  Added:
    - Ability to ignore nicknames on server level or on a per-channel basis
    - Ability to truncate nicknames in buffer
    - New option to customize the appearance of offline nicknames
    - Specify whether nicknames in buffers appear with the user's current status or status at time of sending the message
    - Log level filtering for the log buffer (ctrl + l) and log file
    - Per toast type setting for showing content in toasts
    - Ability to hide nick and mode change server messages
    - Context menu item added to server-wide buffers to mark all messages as read
    - Auto-accept file transfers, with support for nick and mask filtering
    - Adjustable scrollbar sizing

  Fixed:
    - Sidebar menu is now drawn with the correct offset
    - Prevent messages with previews from shifting position on hover
    - Recognize registration completion on older servers without capability negotiation (i.e. send on_connect, umodes, etc.)

  Changed:
    - Optimized message loading by implementing lazy loading: buffers now load only enough messages to fill the visible area instead of always loading 500+ messages.
    - The [buffer.away] section has been split into [buffer.channel.nicklist] and [buffer.nickname] for greater flexibility
    - Colorize the level text in log buffer based on theme
    - Scrollbars now use a dedicated scrollbar color instead of horizontal_rule
    - Tor is now an optional feature. Build with --features tor to enable Tor proxy support
    - Topic "set at" time is now shown with local timezone offset, instead of UTC's
