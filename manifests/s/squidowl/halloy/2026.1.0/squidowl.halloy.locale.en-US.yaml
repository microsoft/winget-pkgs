  Added:
    - Added Open URL entry to URL context menus

    - Setting to adjust entry padding in context menus
    - Support for configuring a regex-based allowlist of URL patterns for Preview
    - Setting to open a new pane, replace current pane, or open a new window after /join
    - Emoji, channel, and user completion can be used with commands
    - Auto-completion (emoji/channel/user) will auto-complete at the text cursor (instead of the end of the current input)
    - Insert-nickname will place the nickname at the text cursor (instead of end of the current input)
    - Backlog separator can be customized with a custom color and text (with the ability to remove text from it)
    - Setting to disable unread indicators for specified channels/servers
    - Users and messages can be filtered using regular expressions
    - Added ability to set default QUIT and PART reason
    - /connect command to temporarily connect to a server
    - Setting for the font size of messages that contain only emojis

    Fixed:
    - No longer any delay in showing a tooltip after hovering
    - Ignored users will not be suggested by user auto-completion
    - Channel auto-completion works with all channel prefixes specified by the server
    - Number pad enter now sends messages instead of adding a new line
    - Join & monitor commands sent automatically on connection respect TARGMAX limits specified by the server
    - /sysinfo is cleared from input when sent, and is recorded to the buffer even if the server doesn't support echoes
    - Channel and user links in messages in the highlight buffer
    - Remember fullscreen state across sessions

    Changed:
    - Keybindings for macOS default to Emacs-like by default, to match native text-input behavior
