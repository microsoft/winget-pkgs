  Added:
    - Added different unread icons for highlights vs regular unread messages
    - Setting to change icons for unread messages and unread highlight messages
    - Setting to change server icon size
    - Setting to control spacing between messages in buffers
    - Ability to specific multiple themes which then gets picked randomly at launch
    - Notification indicator on sidebar menu for warning & error log messages
    - Ability to mark as read on buffer close only if scrolled to the bottom of the buffer (new default behavior)
    - /part, /topic, /mode, /kick, and /ctcp commands can have their target(s) argument skipped when it can be inferred from context (e.g. /topic will target the current channel by default when used in a channel buffer)
    - /cleartopic command to remove a channel's topic (will target the current channel by default when used in a channel buffer)
    - Ability to hide and theme kick server messages
    - Setting to control whether or not to restore on launch the panes that were open when Halloy last closed
    - Setting for split axis chosen as the shorter dimension of the focused pane (new default behavior)
    - Setting for split axis chosen as the shorter dimension of the largest splittable pane
    - soju.im/bouncer-networks support
    - Setting to hide the backlog divider when all messages in the buffer have been read
    - Setting to specify whether nickname highlighting is case sensitive
    - Setting to hide topic changes

  Fixed:
    - Receiving files over DCC will no longer stall when sender stops accepting received receipts
    - Attempting to navigate to the next/previous unread buffer, when there is no such buffer, will no longer clear the buffer
    - Window position is now validated, preventing windows from opening on disconnected monitors
    - When kicked from a channel the kick message will be broadcast in the server buffer (which remains open) as well as in the channel history (which is closed on kick)
    - Preview images with large dimensions will not be displayed if larger than the allowed buffer size
    - Do not activate the mark as read buffer when blocked/hidden messages are unread in the buffer
    - Nickname highlighting is case insensitive by default (and uses the server's specified casemapping)
    - Nickname changes properly broadcast in all channels user is in
    - Page up/down behavior moves by consistent page length, and will no longer get stuck at the top of a buffer
    - file_transfer.save_directory is now affected by path substitutions (tilde expansion & relative path prefixing)

  Changed:
    - Relative paths in configuration files are now prefixed with config dir
