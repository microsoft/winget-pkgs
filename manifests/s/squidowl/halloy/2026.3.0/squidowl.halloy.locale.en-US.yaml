    - Configuration setting to allow locale specification used when formatting timestamps

    - When leaving a server (via context menu on sidebar entry or /quit), the server will not be automatically removed from the sidebar

    - Disconnected servers can be connected to via the "Connect to server" entry in the context menu for its sidebar entry
    - Servers can be prevented from connecting on launch (or configuration reload) with the servers.<name>.autoconnect setting
    - /connect (without an argument) and /reconnect can be used in open buffers for disconnected servers to (re-)connect to the server

    - Virtualize message rendering to improve buffer performance
    - Default proxy used when checking for an update
