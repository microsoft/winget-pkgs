  Fixed:
    - Expanded recognized login notifications (used to join channels that report themselves as requiring registration after logging in)
    - Messages with multiple targets are correctly recorded into multiple buffers (and/or multiple times into the same buffer) client-side.
    - Messages sent with a STATUSMSG prefix are recorded and indicated in the corresponding channel.
    - Ability to position the sidebar at the top, bottom, right, or left. See Sidebar configuration.
    - /mode requires too many parameters for certain commands.
  
  Changed:
    - Reworked themes to add better customization possibilities
      - NOTE Old theme files are not compatibile with the new format. However all the themes in the theme community has been updated to the new format.
    - Unread indicator has changed from a boolean value to a enum. See Sidebar configuration.
    - Renamed sidebar.default_action to sidebar.buffer_action.
    - Auto-completing (with tab) a nickname at the beginning of the input line will append ': ' (colon space). Otherwise, a space is appended to the completion.
  
  Removed:
    - Removed hex configuration option for server messages and nicknames.
      - hex was previously used to overwrite a color value. This is now done through the new theme format.
  
  Notes:
    - In backlog you might see two text markers (∙). This is because we didn't want to update the entire history, when we updated the way we construct text components. New history from this release wont have multiple markers.
    - Your old themes are broke since we updated to a new format. Find themes in the new format here: theme community.
