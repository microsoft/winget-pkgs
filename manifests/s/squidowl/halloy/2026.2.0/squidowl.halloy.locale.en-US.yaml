  Added_
    - Settings to disable (selectively, or for the entire server) confirmation of delivery for sent messages
    - Setting to adjust inner spacing and outer padding for panes (pane.gap.inner, pane.gap.outer)
    - Setting to style unread query buffers as highlights in the sidebar (sidebar.unread_indicator.query_as_highlight)
    - Settings to configure card and image preview dimensions
    - Support for transparent background.

  Fixed:
    - Buffer not showing history until resize
    - Previews are fetched through the same proxy as the server (or default proxy) for HTTP/SOCKS5 proxies
    - No longer highlight nickname mentions in sent messages in certain scenarios
    - Filters applied to one server will no longer hide query panes for other servers
    -Card preview description text is now limited in height to prevent excessive text display

  Changed:
    - No longer highlight matches in sent messages
    - No longer show notifications for messages where the relevant buffer is open and Halloy is focused
