  Additions
  * Add Full Inventory Viewing. Clicking on a players gun skins brings up a popup to view all their equipped skins, sprays and player card. A reminder that this only works in a match (not in agent select or in the lobby).
  * Added Translations
      * Swedish
      * Turkish

  Changes
  * Fix Login Bug that prevented login for all users #45
  * Hopefully fix Issues with Immortal+ players not appearing in the app. This might become Ascendant - Immo, not quite sure how it breaks.
  * Small UI improvements
  * Miscellaneous fixes
  * Better bug catching and fallbacks

  Known Bugs
  * Ranks and match history of players you have played with recently are wrong. In reality, they are cached to prevent rate limits but are not refreshed when a new match is detected.
