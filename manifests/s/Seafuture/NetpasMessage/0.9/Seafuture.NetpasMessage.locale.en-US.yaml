ShortDescription: Your Communication Beyond eMail
Description: Netpas Message is a maritime-focused email system designed to enhance message efficiency while maintaining the core functionalities of a traditional email program. It analyzes vessel data from incoming emails, stores it in the Vessel Manager database, and enables circulation via Open Tonnage. The Project feature automatically organizes operation-related emails by task, enhancing focus and maximizing work efficiency. Furthermore, users can share projects with team members, facilitating not only the exchange of ongoing work emails but also the seamless sharing of insights and resources for improved collaboration.
