ReleaseNotes: |-
  Desktop changes
  - Windows desktop MSI to support headless installation with custom parameters to set up server URL and login mode, an example for this would be msiexec /i "Stirling-PDF-windows-x86_64.msi " /qn STIRLING_SERVER_URL="http://192.168.1.53:2357/" STIRLING_LOCK_CONNECTION=1
  STIRLING_SERVER_URL auto sets the URL and STIRLING_LOCK_CONNECTION=1 sets the connection mode to be ONLY self-host server, ensuring no mistaken connections to external servers.
