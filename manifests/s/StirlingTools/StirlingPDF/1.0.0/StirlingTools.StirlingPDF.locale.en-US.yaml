ReleaseNotes: |-
  V1.0.0 Release is here!
  This release is actually part of a stepping stone into V2.0.0 release coming in a few months with a branch new UI and feel!
  This release includes lots of new features and changes the main changes of note are
  - EML(email) to PDF Feature added
  - Table of Contents editing feature added
  - Fake Scan page feature added to convert a PDF to look like its been scanned (WIP, may be removed)
  - OCR and Compression back to using OCRMyPDF and Ghostscript for advanced PDF operations
  - Added tmp file manager to ensure all files are cleared even in event of crashes
  - Add file attachments to PDF feature added
  For pro users, we have some additional changes, suggest you backup your /configs folder before testing v1.0.0
  - Audit logs
  - Team support with team management
  As part of this release, there is also a slight license change. The core package remains MIT and fully open source, but we have created a 'proprietary' folder to store our 'Pro' features, such as audit/team functionality and account creation etc, which will be under a different license. This is only for our paid features and account creations.
  If you are not using accounts, you remain fully open source, and we have ensured these can be fully decoupled for users who do wish only to use OSS. If you are using accounts, don't worry, no negative changes to functionality are introduced in this PR you can continue using as you would expect
  There are also a lot of minor fixes and changes throughout the UI and backend in this release, including future support for async operations, progress updates and other features coming to V2! Stay tuned!
