ReleaseNotes: |-
  Lots of changes in todays release!
  We have some brand new features and enhancements but we have a reworked our analytics!
  Our opt-in (disabled by default) analytics are now all unified under the same parameter and has been made easier to disable in both settings.yml and consent banner.
