  ⚠️ BREAKING CHANGES FOR DEVELOPERS ⚠️
  - UserAPI._product_state has been replaced by UserAPI._product_state_service since Spotify 1.2.21.
  - Due to changes in Spotify 1.2.19, how we retrieve data for Spicetify.
    Player.data has also changed.
    Since v2.23.0 it now uses PlayerAPI._state to retrieve Player data, possibly leading to different variable names.
    Please update your extensions or custom apps accordingly to both changes
