ShortDescription: |-
  SimpleX - the first messaging network operating without user identifiers of any kind - 100% private by design! iOS,
  Android and desktop apps ðŸ“±!
Description: |-
  Unlike any other existing messaging platform, SimpleX has no identifiers assigned to the users - it does not use phone
  numbers (like Signal or WhatsApp), domain-based addresses (like email, XMPP or Matrix), usernames (like Telegram),
  public keys or even random numbers (like all other messengers) to identify its users - we do not even know how many
  people use SimpleX.
