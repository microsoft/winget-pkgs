ShortDescription: A free ISO image compression software.
Description: A free game ISO file compression software, which can compress and convert normal ISO image files to compressed image format CSO (CISO) files, or decompress CSO files to normal ISO files. This software can support both Sony PlayStation games files and Nintendo games files. If you are a PSP games or Wii games fan, this software will be very useful to you. By using this small tool, you can easily compress your game files, reduce file size and save your disk space, then you can play these games from your memory stick. Although it is not designed with PS2 in mind, the program can also convert PS2 .iso-s, but only if they are less than circa 2.0 GB.
