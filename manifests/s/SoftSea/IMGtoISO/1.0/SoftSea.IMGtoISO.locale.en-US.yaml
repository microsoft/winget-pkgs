Description: IMG to ISO is a reliable and user-friendly utility designed to convert disk image files from the IMG or IMA format into the widely adopted ISO standard.

This tool ensures that converted files conform to ISO-9660 specifications, making them suitable for use across a variety of platforms and applications. In addition to conversion, IMG to ISO also supports opening IMA files, providing a versatile solution for managing disk image formats.
