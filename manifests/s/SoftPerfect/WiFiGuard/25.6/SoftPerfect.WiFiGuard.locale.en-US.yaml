ShortDescription: Security of your Wi-Fi network for Windows, macOS and Linux
Description: |-
  SoftPerfect WiFi Guard is an essential tool for everyone running a small wireless network and striving to keep it safe and secure. Generally, modern Wi-Fi networks are well protected, but there are a number of weaknesses that can compromise your Wi-Fi password; this includes vulnerabilities in encryption and brute force attacks. As a result, someone can gain unauthorised access to your Internet connection and LAN and exploit them while staying unnoticed.
  Perhaps, you can say: “No big deal, I have unlimited Internet traffic!”, but what about someone reading your personal emails, stealing private information or breaking the law online while using your Internet connection?
  WiFi Guard will alert you if your network is used without your knowledge. It is a specialised monitoring application that runs through your network at set intervals and reports immediately if it has found any unrecognised connected devices that could possibly belong to an intruder.
  Key features
  - Pings computers and other network devices and displays those online.
  - Detects firewalled computers that do not respond to ping.
  - Scans your network at a specified interval.
  - Immediately alerts you if an unknown device is found.
