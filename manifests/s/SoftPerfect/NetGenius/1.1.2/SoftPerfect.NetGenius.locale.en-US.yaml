ShortDescription: Internet connection optimisation and application control
Description: |-
  NetGenius is a modern Internet connection monitoring, control and optimisation tool. It lets you watch the apps using your Internet in real-time, control their access, and get detailed usage reports. Bandwidth-sensitive applications like voice calls, videos or games can be prioritised. Less important applications like software updates, file downloads or cloud backups can be restricted to and prevented from occupying your entire connection. Finally, the applications that should not be going online can be blocked from accessing the Internet, which is important for better privacy and security.
