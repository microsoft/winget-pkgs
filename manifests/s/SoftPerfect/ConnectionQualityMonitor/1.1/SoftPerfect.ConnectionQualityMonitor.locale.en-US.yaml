ShortDescription: Internet connection status tracking
Description: |-
  Connection Quality Monitor is a software package that monitors the health of your Internet connection. It periodically checks whether the connection is online, and records ping time, jitter and downtime. Additionally, it periodically performs a speed test and records the measured upload and download speeds.
  This information is presented in a chart, making it easy to spot any intermittent connection issues and verify if download/upload speeds are stable and up to your Internet service provider promises.
  Connection Quality Monitor can be used in multiple locations, for example in several offices connected via VPN, and all its instances can be managed from a single point, such as a network administrator workstation.
