ShortDescription: Sail design and plotting software
Description: |-
  Sailcut CAD is a sail design and plotting software which allows you to design and visualise your own sail and compute
  the accurate development of all panels in flat sheets.

  The original Sailcut was a Basic program developed by Robert Lainé in 1978. The new version, called Sailcut CAD, is
  written in C++ using the Qt framework and is developed jointly by Robert Lainé and Jeremy Lainé. It is distributed
  under the terms of the GNU Public License (GPL).

  Sailcut CAD is able to do cross cut, twist foot cut, vertical cut, mitre cut and radial cut sail design as well as
  wing sails, all in a number of languages. It also includes a viewer where you can assembled a hull, a rig and a set
  of sails to see how they match. Sailcut CAD has been successfully used for making sails for racing and cruising yacht
  as well as for model boats.
