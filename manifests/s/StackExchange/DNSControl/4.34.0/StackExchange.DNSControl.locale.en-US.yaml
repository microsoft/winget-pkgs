  Greetings DNS fans!
  POSSIBLE BREAKING CHANGE!
  - INWX USERS! If you use the NAMESERVER() operator, behavior has changed to be like all other providers. In the past you were unable to delete entries, only add to them. Now NAMESERVER() (if it exists in your D() statement) replaces the delegations at the registrar. Please test your configuration before putting this release into production. You may need to add NAMESERVER() statements.

  Deprecation warnings
  [!WARNING]
  - REV() will switch from RFC2317 to RFC4183 in v5.0. This is a breaking change. Warnings are output if your configuration is affected. No date has been announced for v5.0. See https://docs.dnscontrol.org/language-reference/top-level-functions/revcompat
  - NAMEDOTCOM, OPENSRS and SOFTLAYER need maintainers! These providers have no maintainer. Maintainers respond to PRs and fix bugs in a timely manner, and try to stay on top of protocol changes.
