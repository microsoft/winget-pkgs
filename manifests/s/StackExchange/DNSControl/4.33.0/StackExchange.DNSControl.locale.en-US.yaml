ReleaseNotes: |-
  Greetings DNS fans!
  WARNING: This release overhauled two internal systems. There should be no user-visible affects. However... please test carefully before putting it into production. What changed? (1) how DS records are managed (this doesn't affect many users), and (2) how IP addresses are managed (this affects everyone).
  Highlights:
  - 2 new providers! GIDINET and INFOMANIAK! Grazie to @zupolgec for contributing Gidinet (both DNS provider and registrar) (#4004), and thanks to @jbelien for adding INFOMANIAK (also both DNS provider and registrar) (#3574)
  - 2 big refactoring projects: DS was rewritten to use the more modern RecordConfigV2 (#3996) and we converted net.IP to the more modern netip.Addr (#4012)
  - Cloudflare gained support for record comments, tags, and CNAME flattening thanks to @allixsenos
  - DESEC gained support for LOC record (#4011) thanks to @androw
  - DIGITALOCEAN doccs have been updated (#4029) thanks to @chicks-net (he also contributed #4041 which fixed many broken links)
  - JOKER now correctly updates TTLs on CAA and other records #4019 thanks to @grahammiln
  - And many other improvements!
  Thanks to all contributors involved in this release! This is a community project and we couldn't do it without all of your contributions!
  Sincerely,
  --Tom Limoncelli
