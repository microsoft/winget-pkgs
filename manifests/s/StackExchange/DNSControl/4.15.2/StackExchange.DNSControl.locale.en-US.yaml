ReleaseNotes: |-
  Happy holidays, DNSControl Fans!
  Another quick bugfix release. This is particularly important if you use the BIND provider.
  Bug: BIND
  In 4.15.1 a bug was introduced that made the BIND provider use the same filename for all zonefiles. That is fixed in this release. As a bonus, BIND joins the list of providers that can run concurrently.
  Do not use 4.15.1 if you use BIND.
  Possible bug: IGNORE() plus MYTHICBEASTS
  We're tracking a bug that was reported involving IGNORE() with MYTHICBEASTS (https://github.com/StackExchange/dnscontrol/issues/3227). If you use any of the IGNORE*() functions, please push with caution.
  It might affect other providers that use the diff2.ByZone() function call (AUTODNS, BIND, REALTIMEREGISTER, SAKURACLOUD) with a smaller change it will affect providers that use the diff2.ByRecordSet() function (AZURE, GCLOUD, GCORE, HUAWEICLOUD, NS1, POWERDNS, ROUTE53, TRANSIP).
  If you use any of those providers, we can use your help! Please run the integration tests (https://docs.dnscontrol.org/developer-info/integration-tests) and report if they were successful or not. This release includes a new test that should trigger this bug: Integration test number 77 IGNORE w/change b3227
  That's it!
  Sorry for the releases right before most people are going on break! If you are concerned about other issues, the last v4.14.x release was very stable and is backwards compatible.
  Best,
  Tom

  Deprecation warnings
  [!WARNING]
  - REV() will switch from RFC2317 to RFC4183 in v5.0. This is a breaking change. Warnings are output if your configuration is affected. No date has been announced for v5.0. See https://docs.dnscontrol.org/language-reference/top-level-functions/revcompat
  - MSDNS maintainer needed! Without a new volunteer, this DNS provider will lose support after April 2025. See https://github.com/StackExchange/dnscontrol/issues/2878
  - NAMEDOTCOM and SOFTLAYER need maintainers! These providers have no maintainer. Maintainers respond to PRs and fix bugs in a timely manner, and try to stay on top of protocol changes.
  - get-certs/ACME support is frozen and will be removed without notice between now and July 2025. It has been unsupported since December 2022. If you don't use this feature, do not start. If you do use this feature, migrate ASAP. See discussion in issues/1400
