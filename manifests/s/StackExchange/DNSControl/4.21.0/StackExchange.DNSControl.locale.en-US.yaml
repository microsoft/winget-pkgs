ReleaseNotes: |-
  Greetings, DNS fans!
  What's new? GCORE and NS1 now handle zone creation and listing better. I'm also excited to announce the new "providers page" (which is auto-generated). It is much more readable. Many people were involved in this change, with @chicks-net taking the lead and writing the code. View the results here: https://docs.dnscontrol.org/provider/index
  There were many documentation updates and bugfixes.
  Reminder: get-certs (cert renewals) and the MSDNS provider are scheduled to be removed in July 2025. See below.
  Thanks to all contributors involved in this release! This is a community project and we couldn't do it without all our contributors!
  Sincerely,
  Tom

  Deprecation warnings
  [!WARNING]
  - REV() will switch from RFC2317 to RFC4183 in v5.0. This is a breaking change. Warnings are output if your configuration is affected. No date has been announced for v5.0. See https://docs.dnscontrol.org/language-reference/top-level-functions/revcompat
  - MSDNS maintainer needed! Without a new volunteer, this DNS provider will lose support after April 2025. See https://github.com/StackExchange/dnscontrol/issues/2878
  - NAMEDOTCOM and SOFTLAYER need maintainers! These providers have no maintainer. Maintainers respond to PRs and fix bugs in a timely manner, and try to stay on top of protocol changes.
  - get-certs/ACME support is frozen and will be removed without notice between now and July 2025. It has been unsupported since December 2022. If you don't use this feature, do not start. If you do use this feature, migrate ASAP. See discussion in issues/1400
