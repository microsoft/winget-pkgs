ShortDescription: Synchronize your DNS to multiple providers from a simple DSL
Description: |-
  DNSControl is a system for maintaining DNS zones.
  It has two parts: a domain specific language (DSL) for describing DNS zones plus software that processes the DSL and pushes the resulting zones to DNS providers such as Route53, Cloudflare, and Gandi.
  It can send the same DNS records to multiple providers.
  It even generates the most beautiful BIND zone files ever.
  It runs anywhere Go runs (Linux, macOS, Windows).
  The provider model is extensible, so more providers can be added.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Hello DNSControl fans!This is mostly a bug-fix and catch-up release. The most significant fix is that ppreview --expect-no-changes now works, thus making ppreview/ppush feature complete.  Those commands will replace preview/push in 1-2 releases, so please test them and give your feedback as soon as possible.   For my configuration ppreview reduces run-time from 4-5 minutes to 30 seconds.- New record support: DESEC added SVCB/HTTPS; NS1 added SVCB, HTTPS, TLSA, DNAME, DHCID; BUNNY_DNS added ALIAS.
  - Added support for concurrent operation (ppreview/ppush): NS1, TRANSIP
  - "ppreview --expect-no-changes" now works!
  - ZSH Autocomplete improved
  - Welcome new maintainer for AKAMAIEDGEDNS, Ed Lynes!
  Thanks to everyone for their contributions! This is a community effort and it wouldn't be a success without all your help!Changelog

  Deprecation warnings
  [!WARNING]- REV() will switch from RFC2317 to RFC4183 in v5.0.  This is a breaking change. Warnings are output if your configuration is affected. No date has been announced for v5.0. See https://docs.dnscontrol.org/language-reference/top-level-functions/revcompat
  - MSDNS maintainer needed! Without a new volunteer, this DNS provider will lose support after April 2025. See #2878
  - NAMEDOTCOM and SOFTLAYER need maintainers! These providers have no maintainer. Maintainers respond to PRs and fix bugs in a timely manner, and try to stay on top of protocol changes.
  - get-certs/ACME support is frozen and will be removed without notice between now and July 2025. It has been unsupported since December 2022.  If you don't use this feature, do not start. If you do use this feature, migrate ASAP.  See discussion in issues/1400
