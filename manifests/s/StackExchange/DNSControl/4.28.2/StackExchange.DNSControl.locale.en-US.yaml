ReleaseNotes: |-
  Greetings DNS fans!
  This is a bugfix release. BIND users discovered that "push" was regenerating zonefiles even when there was no change. The reason was that the %D verb was always "" (null string). Shout out to @ondohotola for quickly reporting this bug and confirming the workaround. A full fix is included in v4.28.2.
  This release also includes some documentation and tool improvements.
  Thanks to all contributors involved in this release! This is a community project and we couldn't do it without all of your contributions!
  Sincerely,
  --Tom Limoncelli
  Monthly video call!
  Everyone is invited to the Monthly DNSControl Community Video Conference Call on the 3rd Monday of each month. Join whether you are a new user with questions or an experienced developer that wants to discuss DNSControl internals... or anything in between! Meeting details on GitHub Discussions.
