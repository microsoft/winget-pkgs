  Greetings DNS fans!
  POTENTIAL BREAKING CHANGES:
  - "fmt" now defaults to writing to dnsconfig.js. If you use ">" instead of "-o", check your scripts!
  - The date/time of the Monthly DNSControl Community Video Conference Call will change in January. Look for updates on Github in the next week or so.
  Highlights:
  - "--notify" can be enabled in creds.json so that (for example) you always get notified on "push" (#3910) (@michaelkaye)
  - "fmt" with no options reformats dnsconfig.js in place (This may break some scripts, but its a beta feature). It also is silent when no changes made. Use "-v" to always output the file names. See #3927 for details (#3927) (@tlimoncelli)
  Bug fixes:
  - 51bf2e34d0b16d6096bd47df512370103f9cf1bb: BIND get-zones now works when using %D (#3930) (@tlimoncelli)
  - f7c145a54c3e32bbe9f560e7b56b646f81e5c902: The RP record type was broken in many ways: It ignored the DefaultTTL() setting, it didn't output errors (the record was silently ignored), and a lot of the validation that old-style types benefit from were not replicated in the new code. (#3931) (@tlimoncelli)
  - A lot of code was refactored to be more consistent. None of that should change user-visible behavior.
  Thanks to all contributors involved in this release! This is a community project and we couldn't do it without all of your contributions!
  Sincerely,
  --Tom Limoncelli
