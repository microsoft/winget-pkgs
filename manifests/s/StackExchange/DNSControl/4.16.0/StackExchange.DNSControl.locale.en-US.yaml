ReleaseNotes: |-
  Greetings, DNSControl fans!
  Welcome to v4.16.0!
  Big change: As announced in October 2024, this release removes the old non-concurrent preview/push code. The new code is faster, easier to maintain, easier to add new features. This release removes: ppreview, ppush and --cmode=legacy command-line options. Providers marked as unable to run concurrently run one zone at a time. Thanks to everyone for all the testing, comments, and suggestions!
  This release has one other notable new feature: Azure DNS authentication is now modernized and supports OIDC. Thanks to @lckz!
  This is a community project and we couldn't do it without all our contributors! This release has PRs from 10 people. Thanks! We couldn't do it without you!
  Thanks! Tom

  Deprecation warnings
  [!WARNING]
  - REV() will switch from RFC2317 to RFC4183 in v5.0. This is a breaking change. Warnings are output if your configuration is affected. No date has been announced for v5.0. See https://docs.dnscontrol.org/language-reference/top-level-functions/revcompat
  - MSDNS maintainer needed! Without a new volunteer, this DNS provider will lose support after April 2025. See https://github.com/StackExchange/dnscontrol/issues/2878
  - NAMEDOTCOM and SOFTLAYER need maintainers! These providers have no maintainer. Maintainers respond to PRs and fix bugs in a timely manner, and try to stay on top of protocol changes.
  - get-certs/ACME support is frozen and will be removed without notice between now and July 2025. It has been unsupported since December 2022. If you don't use this feature, do not start. If you do use this feature, migrate ASAP. See discussion in issues/1400
