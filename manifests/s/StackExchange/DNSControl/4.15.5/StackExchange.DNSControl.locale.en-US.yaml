ReleaseNotes: |-
  Hello DNSControl fans!
  Sadly a performance regression that affects CLOUDFLAREAPI and HETZNER users was observed shortly after v4.15.4 shipped. Please ignore v4.15.4 and jump directly to v4.15.5.
  Apologies! We're updating our release process to avoid this particular situation in the future.
  Tom

  Other changes and improvements:
  - 5e15bbe676332beaeae1a3838450b2d6f3e678f2: BUG: fetch zones once in ZoneCache (#3394) (@das7pad)
  Deprecation warnings
  [!WARNING]
  - REV() will switch from RFC2317 to RFC4183 in v5.0. This is a breaking change. Warnings are output if your configuration is affected. No date has been announced for v5.0. See https://docs.dnscontrol.org/language-reference/top-level-functions/revcompat
  - MSDNS maintainer needed! Without a new volunteer, this DNS provider will lose support after April 2025. See https://github.com/StackExchange/dnscontrol/issues/2878
  - NAMEDOTCOM and SOFTLAYER need maintainers! These providers have no maintainer. Maintainers respond to PRs and fix bugs in a timely manner, and try to stay on top of protocol changes.
  - get-certs/ACME support is frozen and will be removed without notice between now and July 2025. It has been unsupported since December 2022. If you don't use this feature, do not start. If you do use this feature, migrate ASAP. See discussion in issues/1400
