ReleaseNotes: |-
  Hello and happy new year, DNS fans!
  This is mostly a bugfix release but 2 of the bugfixes are very important. It is strongly recommended that you upgrade immediately if you use NAMEDOTCOM at all, and if you use IGNORE*() features on AUTODNS, BIND, MYTHICBEASTS, REALTIMEREGISTER, or SAKURACLOUD
  Major bugs:
  - (https://github.com/StackExchange/dnscontrol/issues/3259) NAMEDOTCOM: TXT records were not generated properly. Quotes were added around the text. This went unnoticed for months (years?). Thanks to @tkurki for reporting this! (FYI: This provider needs a volunteer maintainer. See below!)
  - (https://github.com/StackExchange/dnscontrol/issues/3227) IGNORE() deletes ignored records when used with providers that use the diff2.ByZone() function: This affects AUTODNS, BIND, MYTHICBEASTS, REALTIMEREGISTER, SAKURACLOUD only. This was extremely difficult to find but thanks to some smart detective work by @rmc47 we not only found the problem, but developed an entirely new technique for testing IGNORE(). I now have greater confidence in IGNORE() and believe it is bug-free for all cases except when a third-party is updating the zone at the same time (something that can't be fixed because DNS doesn't have transactional locking).
  Other news:
  - AXFRDDNS got a long-needed update from (@gucci-on-fleek) who fixed a number of small problems, enabled LOC records, and added it to The List of AutoTested Providers!
  - MYTHICBEASTS is now on The List of AutoTested Providers thanks to @tomfitzhenry!
  Speaking of The List of AutoTested Providers: These are the providers that get fully tested with each release:
  - AXFRDNS, AZURE_DNS, BIND, CLOUDFLAREAPI, CNR
  - DIGITALOCEAN, GANDI_V5, GCLOUD, HEDNS, HEXONET
  - MYTHICBEASTS, NAMEDOTCOM, NS1, ROUTE53
  - SAKURACLOUD, TRANSIP
  All other providers are not tested as often. Want your provider added to this list? Here's how: https://docs.dnscontrol.org/developer-info/byo-secrets

  Deprecation warnings
  [!WARNING]
  - REV() will switch from RFC2317 to RFC4183 in v5.0. This is a breaking change. Warnings are output if your configuration is affected. No date has been announced for v5.0. See https://docs.dnscontrol.org/language-reference/top-level-functions/revcompat
  - MSDNS maintainer needed! Without a new volunteer, this DNS provider will lose support after April 2025. See https://github.com/StackExchange/dnscontrol/issues/2878
  - NAMEDOTCOM and SOFTLAYER need maintainers! These providers have no maintainer. Maintainers respond to PRs and fix bugs in a timely manner, and try to stay on top of protocol changes.
  - get-certs/ACME support is frozen and will be removed without notice between now and July 2025. It has been unsupported since December 2022. If you don't use this feature, do not start. If you do use this feature, migrate ASAP. See discussion in issues/1400
