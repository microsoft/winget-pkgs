ReleaseNotes: |-
  Thanks to all contributors involved in this release! This is a community project and we couldn't do it without all of your contributions!
  Two highlights in this release:
  The ability to limit concurrency has been a frequent request. The --cmax flag now lets you control that. This is particularly useful for AXFRDDNS users who are frequently talking to DNS servers that protect themselves by limiting how many TCP connections they will accept at any given moment.
  Users of the SPF optimizer will appreciate no longer having to update the spfcache.json file. Simply delete it and the SPF cache is disabled. It probably never was useful anyway.
