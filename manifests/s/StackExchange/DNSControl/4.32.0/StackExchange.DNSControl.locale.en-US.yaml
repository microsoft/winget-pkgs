  Greetings DNS fans!
  Highlights:
  - 9e73e7370ac5677c3ffecac5d0851eb8ff521043: BunnyDNS users will be happy to learn that DNSControl has been updated to allow SRV "." targets, which BunnyDNS only recently started supporting (#4003)
  - ae9759d831ed67a3c0602a58d9733335fe3d2174: Cloudflare users will be happy to know that the warnings the CF Dashboard displays about TXT records are a thing of the past... at least for TXT records created and or updated starting with this version (#3834) (@tlimoncelli)
  - Many documentation improvements, including links to RFCs (#3970 thanks to @grahammiln!) and info on how to use VSCode and the Go Debugger (#3998)
  - Internal improvements continue on the RecordConfigv2 project. Legacy providers (which is all of them, currently) are better supported.
  Thanks to all contributors involved in this release! This is a community project and we couldn't do it without all of your contributions!
  Sincerely,
  --Tom Limoncelli
