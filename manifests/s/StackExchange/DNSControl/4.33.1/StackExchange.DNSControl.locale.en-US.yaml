  Greetings DNS fans!
  Summary: This is a bugfix release (and 2 small additions came along for the ride). If you use the new Cloudflare comments and tags feature, you can now remove those comments and tags too!
  Thanks to all contributors involved in this release! This is a community project and we couldn't do it without all of your contributions!
  Sincerely,
  --Tom Limoncelli
