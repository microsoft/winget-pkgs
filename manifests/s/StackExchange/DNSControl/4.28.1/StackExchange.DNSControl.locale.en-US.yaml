ReleaseNotes: |-
  Greetings DNS fans!
  This release fixes a bug found shortly after v4.28.0 was released. It only affects users of the "split horizons" feature.
  Version v4.28.0 was a big release with many changes. We still recommend exercising great caution before putting it into production. See the v4.28.0 release notes for testing advice. Please file a bug report if you find any issues.
  Thanks to gvengel for reporting the bug so quickly.
