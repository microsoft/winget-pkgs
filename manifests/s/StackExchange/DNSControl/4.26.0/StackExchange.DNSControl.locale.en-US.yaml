ReleaseNotes: |-
  Greetings DNS fans!
  Thanks to all contributors involved in this release! This is a community project and we couldn't do it without all of your contributions!
  For many years users have complained that the validation messages don't report which line contains the error... and rightfully so! It's pretty difficult to debug a problem when you don't know where to look. Sadly the JavaScript interpreter we use doesn't make it easy. I finally found a way. It isn't clean nor pretty but it works! Sadly we can't extract the filename, but at least we're moving in the right direction.
  Here's an example where the error is 5 chars into line 1882:
  2025/10/10 13:34:44 ERROR: [line::1882:5]: MX example.com: target (mx.sendgrid.net) must end with a (.) [https://docs.dnscontrol.org/language-reference/why-the-dot]
