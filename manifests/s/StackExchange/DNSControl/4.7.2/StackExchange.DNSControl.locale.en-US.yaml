ShortDescription: Synchronize your DNS to multiple providers from a simple DSL
Description: |-
  DNSControl is a system for maintaining DNS zones.
  It has two parts: a domain specific language (DSL) for describing DNS zones plus software that processes the DSL and pushes the resulting zones to DNS providers such as Route53, Cloudflare, and Gandi.
  It can send the same DNS records to multiple providers.
  It even generates the most beautiful BIND zone files ever.
  It runs anywhere Go runs (Linux, macOS, Windows).
  The provider model is extensible, so more providers can be added.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Welcome to v4.7.2!

  This is the first production-ready release in the v4.7.x series (v4.7.0 and v4.7.1-beta should not be used in production; sorry about any confusion that may have caused... this was the first time doing a release that way).

  This release implements a single change: How TXT records are stored internally. There should be no user-visible changes.
    - TXT-handling code is now simplified with fewer edge-cases
    - A new opinion is added ("Opinion # 8 TXT Records are one long string")
    - The get-zone subcommand now generates TAB-separated files that are more correct for TXT records (the quotes were a bug).
  TXT record handling was complex because we abstracted them at the wrong layer. Code that works with TXT records is now more simple, easier to modify, and a lot of minor bugs have been squashed. For example, diff'ing old and new TXT records is consistent across all providers.

  Thanks to everyone for help testing this release!
