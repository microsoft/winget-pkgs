ReleaseNotes: |-
  Below are the highlights between v 24.12.12 - v 24.12.19.3:

   + Overhauled Windows.Gaming.Input implementation to support hot-plugging
        PlayStation controllers and enabling "Xbox Mode" without requiring a
          complete game restart.
   + Add logarithmic scaling to deadzone compensation on PlayStation controllers
        and extend the option to native Xbox controllers also.
   + Fixed off-by-one issue when quantizing the x-axis in some PlayStation device
        configurations.
    + Allow DualSense users (non-Edge version) to access the Impulse Trigger
        strength slider.
    + Correctly show PlayStation icon in GameInput games only when PlayStation
        input/output is active, for native GameInput remove the icon.
    + Reduce latency on HID output reports (i.e. rumble, lighting changes, etc.)
        for DualShock 4 and DualSense{Edge} controllers.
    + Clear the state of the PlayStation button when all PlayStation controllers
        disconnect, so that SK doesn't block all other buttons because it thinks
          the user is trying to input a PlayStation + <...> button combo.
    + Correctly implement AVIF screenshot encoder quality; quantizer was set to
        lossless at all quality levels before!
