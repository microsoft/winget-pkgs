ReleaseNotes: |-
  Below are the highlights between v 24.10.26.2 - v 24.11.1.1:

   + Fixed changes to SK_WindowManager::StyleHasBorder (...) in 24.10.24.4
       that were causing added window borders to Baldur's Gate 3 when set to
         Borderless in-game.
   + Add new fallback for WMAITX support testing on CPUs with CPUIDs that
       claim the instruction is unsupported... just run the instruction and
         see if it generates and Illegal Instruction exception or not, lol.
   + Allow Multitasking-on-Top to be used without Global Injection service,
       but turn off certain functionality that cannot work reliably without.
   + Handle window position changes that occur without showing up a game's
       window message queue.
   + Cleanup various RawInput handling code.
   + Improved/made obsolete mouse anti-warp for games that move their cursor
       to the center of the screen to implement mouselook (stupid devs...).
   + Remove old compatibility hack for ReShade that was changing Flip Model
       SwapChains to Flip Sequential. ReShade works with Flip Discard now.
   + Added option block screensaver activation on controller input (default)
   + Added option to have Special K disable all game handling of screensavers,
       and fully manage it based on its own configurable rules.

      >> Without this option, SK adds additional blocking rules, but respects
           the game's own attempts to block screensaver activation.

      * Many games unconditionally block screensaver, and you may not want
          that behavior if you have alt-tab to work a different application
            and then go AFK while the game continues running.
   + Changed screensaver activation prevention to use the Windows-defined timeout
       interval and factor in gamepad input, since Windows only uses KB&M.
   + Added a message when the system screensaver activates explaining how to
       configure screensaver prevention.
   + Default screensaver policy has been changed to "Game Default".
   + Always use the fully qualified path when looking up NVIDIA driver profiles
       for the current game in order to avoid creating duplicates.
   + Fix bug in Ys X where it may attempt to create 0x0 textures when its window
       is minimized and then crash.
   + Add explicit overrides for many of the most important SDL input settings

      ( -1 = No Override, 0 = Off, 1 = On )

      * Refer to SDL_hints.h for details on each,

        "FullPlayStationBluetoothSupport" is a combination of
          SDL_JOYSTICK_HIDAPI_PS4_RUMBLE and SDL_JOYSTICK_HIDAPI_PS5_RUMBLE...

        This setting is controversial, it will allow rumble and haptics over
          Bluetooth, but will cause your gamepad to become incompatible with
            games that use DirectInput until powered off and back on...

        ^ If that sounds familiar, it is the entire reason ValvePlug was created.

     *** Unlike the Steam Client, SDL never enables those things without consent,
           and that means rumble may be missing from many games that use SDL.
   + Allow SDL to use DirectInput gamepads at sanity level 1
   + Improve Vulkan/DXGI Layer detection for NVIDIA drivers to handle cases
       where vulkan-1.dll is calling DXGI directly instead of nvoglv{32|64}.
   + Turn Multitasking-on-Top off by default again, because at levels aggressive
       enough to work, some windows will not be raised above the game.
   + Make sure SK always calls the real ShowWindow (...) instead of its hook.
   + Handle undocumented special cases SWP_NOCLIENTMOVE and SWP_NOCLIENTSIZE,
       to fix problems with Sonic Generations
   + Added support for minimizing/restoring borderless games by pressing the
       normal Windows keybinds to do so (Win+Down / Win+Up).
   + Avoid unnecessary window position and border style API calls when no actual
       change is required.
   + Allow WS_ICONIC window style to be set if borderless override is not on.
   + Add WS_EX_WINDOWEDGE to list of extended window styles that have borders.
   + Fixed ReShade Plug-In selection UI not correctly turning Compatibility Mode
       off (necessary for some ReShade Add-Ons to work).
   + HDR Remastered tooltip now ONLY counts memory for remastered RenderTargets
       and Unordered Access Views that are -still- in memory, and values decrease
         as a game unloads remastered resources.

      * It now accurately measures extra VRAM used by having remasters enabled.

   + Remastered D3D11 RenderTargets and Unordered Access Views now have names
       describing the type of resource, a unique ID and the original Surface
         format before SK upgraded it to R16[G16[B16A16]]_{FLOAT|UNORM}.

      * Names appear in debug logs and the Render Mod Tools (Live RenderTargets).

   + Fixed SKIF not being able to disable GFE notifications due to disabled code
   + Increase delay between first drawing an achievement unlock popup and taking
       screenshot, so that statistics such as unlock time reliably appear.
