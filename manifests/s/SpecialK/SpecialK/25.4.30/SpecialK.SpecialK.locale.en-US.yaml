ReleaseNotes: |-
  + Detect and ignore RTSS Reflex latency markers because they actually
      lead to increased latency when they interfere with SK's framerate limiter.
   + Improve handling of WM_DEVICECHANGE for DBT_DEVNODES_CHANGED to throttle the
      performance-related problems from plugging/unplugging controllers, without
        causing some games to stop supporting controller hotplug altogether.
   + Disable DXGI Flip Model by default in Metro 2033 to avoid visual glitches.
   + Fixed scRGB HDR-related issues in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33.
