ReleaseNotes: |-
  + Auto-load REFramework.dll in Monster Hunter Wilds so that it does not have
       to be loaded as dinput8.dll and will work more stable.
   + Prevent REFramework from breaking various DirectInput code that causes input
       problems in Monster Hunter Wilds, provided you load it as REFramework.dll
         instead of dinput8.dll.
   + Disable Reflex Sleep permanently in Monster Hunter Wilds, after profiling
       their Reflex implementation is so bad that it's only increasing latency.

     * Make sure you are using nightly build from 25/3/4 or newer of REFramework;
         the only purpose for Reflex Sleep was to improve framegen pacing when
           the game's anti-tamper runs every frame and REFramework removes the
             frame pacing obstacle at its source.
