ReleaseNotes: |-
  Below are the highlights between v 24.11.16.3 - v 24.11.24.2:

   + Fixed D3D11 screenshots occasionally causing display mode changes to fail if
       resolution changes after taking a screenshot.
   + Cleaned-up Mouse Cursor section of Input Control Panel and removed the old,
          "Low-Level Mouse Settings" section.
   + Update ReShade Add-on API headers to include new events in the next release.
   +Enable Fake Fullscreen mode by default in STALKER 2, because it uses that
       crap (in D3D12) for HDR...
   + Disable SteamAPI file hash checks on Fallout 4.
   + Fixed problems with SK not re-initializing D3D11 when the active SwapChain
       is destroyed and re-created.
