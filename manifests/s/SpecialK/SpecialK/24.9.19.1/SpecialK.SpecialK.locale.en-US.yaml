ReleaseNotes: |-
  Below are the highlights between v 24.9.18.4 - v 24.9.19.1:

   + Added auto-loading of .asi files from a game's directory or from
       any subdirectory of Special K's Profiles\<Game Name> directory.

     * This makes SK an automatic ASI loader and eliminates the need
         for third-party software to use ASI mods such as FFXVIFix.

      > Just drop your .asi file(s) into the appropriate directory and go!

      ( Feature is disabled-by-default in most games, but can be opted-in )

        To opt-in per-game, or globally (Global\default_SpecialK.ini), set:

          [SpecialK.System]
          AutoLoadASIFiles=true

   + Added an internal blacklist of third-party overlays that cannot be used
       in NVIDIA Streamline games because they will crash frame generation.

     * These are nothing to do with Special K itself, but blocking them puts
         an end to really cryptic errors from the overlays being blamed on SK.

      Currently only one overlay is known to be 100% incompatible and blocked:

        - fpsmon-64.dll

      This overlay creates useless "Operation Completed Successfully" error
        dialogs and then proceeds to b0rk the game.

      When the developer goes through the hell that is making their overlay
        compatible with NVIDIA Streamline and DLSS3 Frame Generation, the
          software will be removed from the blocklist.

   + Tweaked DirectStorage queue lengths in Final Fantasy XVI
