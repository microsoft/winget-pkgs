ReleaseNotes: |-
  Below are the highlights between v 24.12.20.2 - v 24.12.27.2:

    + Fixed recent change that would cause the control panel to crash in Steam games
       if Steam cloud is disabled or SteamAPI integration is turned off.
   + Revert scheduler changes related to Sleep (0) behavior in 24.12.15 that cause
       Silent Hill 2 to crash.
   + Fixed CPU affinity mask potentially overflowing and not working in 32-bit.

  [ReShade Stuff]

   + When ReShade is used as dxgi.dll in D3D12 games, SK no longer gives warnings
       about compatibility problems.
   + Avoid using explicitly constructed ReShade effect runtimes as much as
       possible when SK is not running in Hookless ReShade (compatibility) mode,
         to avoid confusing AddOns that think these are normal ReShade runtimes.
   + Added checks to detect ReShade's incorrectly reported D3D11 immediate device
       context reference counts that may cause deadlock during game exit or when
         temporary D3D11 devices are constructed and destroyed (ie. overlay init)

   + Avoid destroying the SwapChain that Special K creates during initialization
       to setup D3D11 hooks, because poorly written ReShade addons may crash.
   + Create an IDXGIFactory2 rather than IDXGIFactory when initializing hooks to
       avoid complications from ReShade calling QueryInterface to upgrade an
         interface that SK has not yet wrapped.
   + Fixed potential deadlock in RenoDX mods, the ones that do not check for
       nullptr before dereferencing ptrs will simply have to crash until fixed.

  [QoL Stuff]

   + Automatically apply anti-cheat bypass to all Hoyo games according to their
       digital certificate, so I no longer have to manually do this when they
         release a new game.
   + The option to disable the Steam overlay's rendering now also blocks it from
       installing input hooks, making it finally inert.
   + Fixed absent custom resolutions caused by a typo in the Display menu a few
       years ago...
   + Restored missing audio devices in the list of pairable display/audio output
       mappings, lost about a month ago.

  [Optimization]

   + Lowered CPU overhead in D3D11 games related to third-party overlay color
       correction shader replacement when an HDR display is attached.
      >> State tracking for them will only occur during Present (...) calls now.
   + Further reduce performance overhead in D3D11 across the board for CPU-bound
       scenarios in games that make a lot of draw calls.
   + Optimized Get/SetMute to avoid constructing a temporary ISimpleAudioVolume
       COM object every time it is called.
   + Reduced performance overhead of the Steam and battery management sections of
       the control panel (battery overhead applies to framepacing widget too...)
   + Ignore D3D11DeviceContext Set*Resource state tracking unless the render mod
       tools window is open.
   + Added internal settings to control D3D11 state tracking for map/unmap and
       set shader resources API calls, and disabled them for a few high overhead
         games.
   + Optimized D3D11 state tracker to ignore set shader calls, and draw calls unless
       specific combinations of render mods that actually need them are active.
   + Optimized shader tracker to avoid clearing active RTV cache at the end-of-frame
       unless render mod tools window is open.
   + Optimized timer queries used by SK's shader profiler and HDR widget to suspend
       while render mod toolkit / HDR widget are not active.
   + Optimized D3D11 Stateblock Restore code to bypass invoking SK's state tracking
       hooks.
   + Optimized control panel's end-of-frame input polling and cursor status checks.
