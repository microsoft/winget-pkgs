ReleaseNotes: |-
  + Restructure hook initialization procedure during startup to get render APIs
        initialized earlier and separate input API initialization that should not
          be done from DllMain.
   + Added nvngx_update.exe hung process termination back to injection service.
   + Remove multiple calls to slDLSSGSetOptions (...) during one frame in
        Assassin's Creed Shadows.
   + Fixed AC Shadows flagging sl::PreferenceFlags::eAllowOTA without flagging
        sl::PreferenceFlags::eLoadDownloadedPlugins, which causes DLLs to update,
          but the updated DLLs never to load (i.e. why DLSS/Reflex doesn't work).

       * This fix may require local injection if render hook initialization is
           too slow; it cannot be fixed if delayed injection is used.
