ReleaseNotes: |-
  + Remove support for Assassin's Creed: Shadows; it will be treated like
       a generic D3D12 game now. SK's plug-in is no longer compatible.
   + Ignore bug in NVIDIA Streamline in Borderlands 4 that causes it to
       try to set the wrong HDR colorspace (scRGB) for HDR10.
