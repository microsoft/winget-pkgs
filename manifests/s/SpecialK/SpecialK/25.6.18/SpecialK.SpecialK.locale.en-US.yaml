         support DualSense Edge's full capabilities (1 kHz native) on PC.
   + When a game turns Reflex Low Latency + Boost mode on and enables Boost using
       Latency Markers, SK will now use that as the default override setting.
   + Added HEIC decode support to SKIV.
   + Added proper handling of Ray Reconstruction in Vulkan games.
   + Prevent altering window layering (always-on-top) in DOOM: The Dark Ages to
