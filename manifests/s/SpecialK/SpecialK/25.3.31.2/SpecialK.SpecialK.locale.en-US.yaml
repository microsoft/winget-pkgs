ReleaseNotes: |-
  + Simplified control panel options in Assassin's Creed Shadows.
   + Reduced NVAPI HW sensor monitoring and VRR status check overhead on recent
       NVIDIA drivers.
   + Options to override RGB colors on DualSense controllers now apply (in USB) in
              games using SONY's native API.
   + Fixed occasional double keyboard input processing (SK hotkeys) when using
       ReShade 6.4.0+.
   + Improved Unity Engine texture cache compatibility in versions > 2021.
   + Terminate hung nvngx_update.exe processes at game exit, rather than when
       the global injection service starts/stops.
   + Added delay to ExitProcess (...) hook to ensure that SK saves its DLL cfg
       in Assassin's Creed Shadows before the game crashes during its exit code.
