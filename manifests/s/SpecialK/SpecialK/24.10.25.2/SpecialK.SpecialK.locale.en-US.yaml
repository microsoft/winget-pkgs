ReleaseNotes: |-
  Below are the highlights between v 24.10.24 - v 24.10.25.2:

    + Change compiler settings to generate code more compatible with the Steam
       overlay on some systems.
   + Enable Multitasking-on-Top mode by default
   + Make gamepad input activity hide the cursor as default policy
       when enabling cursor auto-hide
   + Add checks to prevent confusing SKIF and SKIV when SK needs to send
       signals to SKIF during injection.
   + Prevent turning off "Background Render" mode while Fake Fullscreen is
       enabled.
   + Improve SDL detection for games (i.e. Ys X) that use SDL, but have
       overridden the default window class name.
   + Add various default behavior overrides for SDL games to avoid double
       input polling and buggy window management without recompiling SDL.

     * An INI parameter has been added to control this,
