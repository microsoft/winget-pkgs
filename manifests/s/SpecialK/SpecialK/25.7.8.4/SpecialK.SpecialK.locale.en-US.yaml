ReleaseNotes: |-
  + Extended support for VRR status monitoring and AutoVRR framerate limiter
       optimization to cover AMD and Intel GPU owners.
   + VRR status text now identifies the active display tech between NVIDIA G-SYNC,
       AMD FreeSync, VESA AdaptiveSync and HDMI Forum VRR.
   + Added VRR Range and LFC status to the VRR section of the Control Panel.
   + Hide Special K's overlay and block gamepad input to games when the Xbox
       GameBar is open and "redirecting input."
   + Clamp HDR retrofit alpha in scRGB to [0,1], as it would never have values
       outside this range in SDR.
   + Added SKIV to the set of applications that SKIF will disable the
       GeForce Experience overlay for.
   + Fixed missing lighting in Star Wars: Jedi Survivor due to incorrect resource
       dimensions in call to ID3D12GraphicsCommandList::CopyResource (...).
   + Improved window layering (Always-on-Top) overrides when "Continue Rendering"
       is used in NVIDIA Vk/DXGI Interop-based games.
   + Workaround various SDL3 bugs.
   + Merge pull request #281 from miguelkmarques:ac-shadows-1-0-6-support
       * AC Shadows 1.0.6 Support (exception addresses updated).
   + Eliminate small hitch when opening SK's Control Panel.
   + Improved thread-safety on VRR VBlank counter thread during SwapChain resize.
   + Added additional debug logging, thread-safety and 32-bit OS fixes to SKIF.
   + Added warning if user tries to set a non-native Fullscreen Exclusive res.
       while Special K's "Fake Fullscreen" mode is active, since it will fail!

   + Added INI option to force DirectStorage games to use the GPU if they initialize
       DStorage queues without a D3D12 device.

     * This brings back HW accelerated texture streaming to Monster Hunter: Wilds

     [Render.DStorage]
     UseDummyD3D12DeviceIfNeeded={true|false}  Default: true

      + In many games, DStorage is initialized before graphics / windows are init.
          so it may be necessary to use local injection for this feature.

   + Added tooltip to PlayStation controller latency measurement when Bluetooth
       controllers are in read-only (DirectInput compatibility mode) explaining
         why latency measurement is not possible.

     * Controller will be removed from read-only mode if a game uses rumble, if
         "Always Enable Full Capabilities" is selected, or if other software
           (e.g. Steam Input) disabled it after powering-on the controller.

   + Favor system registry cached EDIDs over extracting them from HW using NvAPI.

      * NOTE:  Current versions of CRU cause corruption on edited EDIDs for
                 displays with more than 256-bytes of EDID (i.e. AW3423DW).

          Problem has been reported and should be fixed soon.
