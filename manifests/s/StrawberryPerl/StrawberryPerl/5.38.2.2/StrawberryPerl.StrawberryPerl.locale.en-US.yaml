ReleaseNotes: "Perl 5.38.2 for 64-bit environments.Key differences from the 5.38.0 release are:- The make.exe and cmake.exe files have been removed.  They caused clashes with other toolchains.\n- The patch utility is now the same as the one provided with Strawberry Perl 5.32.  The one provided with SP 5.38.0 and SP 5.36.1 does not work properly.  StrawberryPerl/build-extlibs#51\n- All external libs packaged with 5.32.1 are part of the distribution.\n- DBD::MySql is not provided.  Newer versions of DBD::MySql require a more recent version of libmysql, which is not yet part of the build system (but see \n- This perl is built with additional compiler optimisations.  If there are any instabilities then these will need to be reverted.\nNote that this release uses the same compiler toolchain as version 5.38.0.1 so will have the same UTF-8 locale issues.  See"
