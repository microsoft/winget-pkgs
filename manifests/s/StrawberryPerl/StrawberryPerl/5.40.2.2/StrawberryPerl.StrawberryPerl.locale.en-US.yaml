ReleaseNotes: |-
  Strawberry Perl 5.40.2.2.
  MSI, portable and PDL editions.
  Compiled using GCC 13.2 with UCRT.
  Main differences from a standard Windows perl build using GCC:
  - A version of Perl/perl5#23179 is used. This has been modified to allow for version differences from perl 5.42 which it targets.
  - Perl has been compiled using the same optimisations as Strawberry Perl 5.38.2.2. This uses additional options compared to the default -Os. Config_heavy.pl has then been updated to use -O2 when building CPAN distributions.
