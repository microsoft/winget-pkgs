ReleaseNotes: |-
  üöÄ features and other updates
  Enable runner script's build detection by default to require --allow-empty by @eed3si9n in #7966
  Support glob expressions in scripted to aid sbt 2.0.0-M3 cross building by @eed3si9n in #7933 / #7968
  - perf: Precompile a regex in hot code by @retronym in sbt/zinc#1508
  Build directory detection
  Starting 1.10.7, the sbt runner script enables build directory detection by default. This means that the sbt will exit with error when launched in a directory without build.sbt or project/, with exceptions of sbt new, sbt --script-version etc.
  
  To override this behavior temporarily, you can use --allow-empty flag. To permanently opt out of the build directory detection, create $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/sbt/sbtopts with --allow-empty in it.
  
  csrMavenDependencyOverride setting
  sbt 1.10.7 updates Coursier to 2.1.11. sbt 1.10.7 also adds a new setting csrMavenDependencyOverride (default: false), which controls the resolution, which respects Maven dependency override mechanism, also known as bill-of-materials (BOM) POM. Since there is a performance regression in the new resolver, we are setting the default to false.
  
  üêõ bug fixes
  - fix: Add csrMavenDependencyOverride to opt into bill-of-material (BOM) respecting Coursier resolution by @eed3si9n in #7970
  - fix: Update the template resolver to use Giter8 0.17.0, which fixes the SLF4J warning by @eed3si9n in #7947
  - fix: Update JLine 2 fork to 9a88bc4 and Jansi to 2.4.1, which fixes crash on Windows on ARM by @Friendseeker in #7952
  üé¨ behind the scene
