  Scala Nightly repository
  Scala Team now publishes nightlies to a dedicated Artifactory instance. sbt 1.11.5 adds a new resolver for this:
  resolvers += Resolver.scalaNightlyRepository
  ThisBuild / scalaVersion := "3.8.0-RC1-bin-20250823-712d5bc-NIGHTLY"
  Compile / scalacOptions += "-language:experimental.captureChecking"
  This was contributed by @hamzaremmal in sbt/librarymanagement#532
  Scala 3.8.0 support
  Scala 3.8.0 will in-source the Scala standard library (scala-library) instead of using one from Scala 2.13. sbt 1.11.5 relaxes the Coursier same-version enforcement to support Scala 3.8.0.
  This was pair programmed by @hamzaremmal + @eed3si9n during Scala Days 2025 as #8226
  sbt --jvm-client
  sbt 1.11.5 runner script adds new --jvm-client flag to launch the JVM version of the thin client. The implementation is the Scala code which sbtn is based on. This will be useful on platforms or CPU architectures that we do not build sbtn.
  This was contributed by @eed3si9n in #8232
