ShortDescription: QSapecNG is a Qt-based program for symbolic analysis of linear analog circuits.
Description: |-
  QSapecNG is a Qt-based program for symbolic analysis of linear analog circuits. In fact, it consists of two indipendent parts: the SapecNG framework engine and the application gui QSapecNG.
  It is an open source, multi-platform project, continuously enhanced by students and researchers of Department of Electronics and Telecommunications (DET) of the University of Florence. It comes as continuation of SapWin for Windows, in order to give to the project a full compatibility on other platforms.
  Through SapecNG/QSapecNG users can draw, solve and analyze analog circuits as well as manage them. Since version 2.0.0~beta1 there is also the full support for sub-circuits that can be created, saved, reopened and added as part of other circuits.
