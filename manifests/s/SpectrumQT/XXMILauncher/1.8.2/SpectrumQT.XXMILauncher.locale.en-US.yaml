ReleaseNotes: |-
  Additions
    [Model Importers]: Added process Start Method option to General Settings with 2 options: Native (old method) and Shell (may work better for some corrupted OS).
    [WWMI]: Added support for Steam Launch Options macro to directly start game with WWMI via Play button on Steam (e.g. "C:\Games\XXMI Launcher\Resources\Bin\XXMI Launcher.exe" && %command%).
    [Launcher]: Added "Appreciation Corners" listing active dev team for every Model Importer and their pay respect links.
  Adjustments
    [GIMI]: Shell Start Method is now default for GIMI (since it's less likely to trigger GI Anti-Cheat).
  Improvements
    [Settings]: Minor GUI improvements.
  Bugfixes
    [Settings]: Fixed input filter errors for Start Behaviour - Timeout Launcher Settings field.
