ReleaseNotes: |-
  Hotfix 1.8.4
    Fixed existing dll_initialization_delay detection corrupting config.
  Additions
    [Model Importers]: Added XXMI Delay option to General Settings. It allows to postpone DLL initialization by given number of milliseconds. Prevents Wuthering Waves crash on launch and may help with other games.
