  Additions
    [Model Importers]: Added extra Start Method - Manual. It make the launcher wait until a user starts the game manually. It's equivalent to setting Custom Launch to REM.
    [WWMI]: Added Texture Boost option to General Settings. Its fine tuning allows to fix the short lived textures glitch that happens on switch to modded character.
  Bugfixes
    [Settings]: Fixed minor input filtering errors for integer values.
