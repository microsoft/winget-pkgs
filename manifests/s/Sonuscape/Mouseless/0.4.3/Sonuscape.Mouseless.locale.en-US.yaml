ReleaseNotes: |-
  This patch release adds offline / air-gapped license activation and a few minor fixes / enhancements.
  Feedback always appreciated! 🙏
  Enhancements
  - Offline licensing, for air-gapped or other network-limited machines. Accessible from the introductory dialogs before Mouseless is activated, or from the Mouseless menu (Tools -> Offline licensing) for refreshing.
    - Currently requires a refresh every 30 days, and allows one machine transfer every 30 days, but I will look to extend this to 60 or 90 days soon, or possibly implement an alternative transfer mechanism to eliminate the need to refresh altogether.
  - move to next/previous monitor commands now use the monitors' x position (ties broken by y position), instead of the system's monitor numbering
  Fixes
  - Fixed issues with the close ui element command -- should now work consistently, including to close the config editor
  Windows
  - Fixed mouse button up event happening in incorrect location when hide_cursor_on_click is enabled
  Mac
  - Fixed persistent presence in dock / app-switcher even when all windows are closed
