ReleaseNotes: |-
  Features
  - Add a hidden --mindepth alias for --min-depth. (#1617)
  Bugfixes
  Changes
  - Replace humantime crate and chrono crate with jiff crate, see #1690 (@sorairolake). This has some small changes to the
    way dates given to options such --changed-within and --changed-before including:
    - 'M' no longer means "month", as that could be confusing with minutes. Use "mo", "mos", "month" or "months" instead.
    - month and year now account for variability in the calander rather than being a hard-coded number of seconds. That is probably
      what you would expect, but it is a slight change in behavior.
  - aarch64 Windows was added to CI and release artifacts
  - Many dependencies were updated
  - Better support building on Illumos (there is no automated testing, but some known issues were fixed)
  Other
  This will be the last release that has been tested on x86_64 Mac OS, since GitHub is
  dropping support for runners with that hardware.
  It may also be the last release to use a version of Rust with tier-1 support for
  x86_64/intel Macs and Windows 7.
