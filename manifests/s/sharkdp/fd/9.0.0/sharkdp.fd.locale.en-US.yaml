ReleaseNotes: |-
  Performance
  - This release is all about performance, which has been significantly improved, both due to optimizations in the underlying ignore crate (#1429 by @tavianator), and in fd itself (#1422, #1408, #13620 by @tavianator).
    Benchmarks results show gains of 6-8x for full traversals of smaller directories (100k files) and up to 13x for larger directories (1M files).
  - The default number of threads is now constrained to be at most 64.
    This should improve startup time on systems with many CPU cores. (#1203, #1410, #1412, #1431) - @tmccombs and @tavianator
  - New flushing behavior when writing output to stdout, providing better performance for TTY and non-TTY use cases, see #1452 and #1313 (@tavianator).
  Features
  - Support character and block device file types, see #1213 and #1336 (@cgzones)
  - Breaking: .git/ is now ignored by default when using --hidden / -H, use --no-ignore / -I or --no-ignore-vcs to override, see #1387 and #1396 (@skoriop)
  Bugfixes
  - Fix NO_COLOR support, see #1421 (@acuteenvy)
  Other
  - Fixed documentation typos, see #1409 (@marcospb19)
