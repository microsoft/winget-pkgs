ShortDescription: A comprehensive professional real-time software suite that transforms your PC into a full set of measurement instruments, with no additional hardware required (you can use your PCâ€™s sound card). Alternatively, you can use specific external hardware.
Description: |-
  VA is a real-time program that simulates a range of electronic instruments, including:
  - Oscilloscope (dual channel, xy, time division, trigger);
  - Spectrum Analyzer with amplitude and phase display (linear, log, lines, bar, octaves band analysis 1/3, 1/6, 1/9, 1/12, 1/24);
  - Wave-form generator with "custom functions", triangular, square, sinusoidal (all with NO ALIASING and smooth transition), white/pink noise, pulse generation, DC generation;
  - Frequency meter (in time and frequency domain) and counter; in time domain by means of a real time zero crossing algorithm;
  - Volt meter with DC , true RMS, peak to peak and mean display plus resolution calculus;
  - Filtering (low pass, hi pass, band pass, band reject, notch, "diode", DC removal, graphic equalizer;
  - Memo windows (data log) for analysis and storage of time series, spectrum and phase with "triggering" events; THD and Impedance data logging with spline interpolation; possibility to save the graphics in various format (.tee, .txt, .wmf) )and display them with an internal viewer;
  - Screenshot of Spectrum and Scope window;
  - A TRUE software digital analog conversion (for complete signal reconstruction using Nyquist theorem);
  - Frequency compensation: possibility to create/edit a custom frequency response and add it to the spectrum analyzer computed spectrum; added standard weighting curves A,B,C in parallel with custom frequency response;
  - Support for 8/16/24 bit soundcard by means of API calls;
  - Internal 80 bit IEEE floating point variables for minimum rounding error;
  - Unlimited frequency sampling (depend from the capabilities of your soundcard/acquisition device);
  - Cepstrum analysis;
  - Cross Correlation;
  - Extended THD measurements, with automatic sweep, compensation, data log;
  - ZRLC-meter with Vector scope, automatic sweep in time and frequency for automatic measurement;
  - Calibration mechanism (you can calibrate the VA scales directly in VOLT or dB or percent full scale);
  - Set of values computed in real time (peak to peak, peak, crest factor, form factor, true rms, mean, frequency with zero-crossing algorithm);
  - Wave/flac/mp3 file recording and playback;
  - Internal input;
  - Custom FIR filters;
  - Graphic equalizer;
  - Acquires audio samples from other applications;
  - Tool for automatic computation of frequency response of device (amplifier, louspeaker etc. for now only two simple methods, but soon MLS and ESS);
  - Automatic Check for new version of VA (main menu, help item).
