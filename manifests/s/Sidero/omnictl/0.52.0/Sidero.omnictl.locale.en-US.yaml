  Omni 0.52.0 (2025-07-08)
  Welcome to the v0.52.0 release of Omni!
  Please try out the release binaries and report any issues at
  https://github.com/siderolabs/omni/issues.
  Support Fusion Auth
  Fusion Auth provider is now supported via SAML.
  Additional parameter --auth-saml-name-id-format must be set to urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:emailAddress.
  Infra Providers Request ID
  Infra providers can now be configured to encode MachineRequest ID into the join token.
  With that enabled setting the machine UUID in the MachineRequestStatus is no longer required in the provider:
  Omni will automatically map the MachineRequest ID to the node UUID and will populate the field in the status.
  This change is useful in the infra providers where it's impossible to get the created machine UUID.
  Allow talosctl wipe disk Command
  talosctl wipe disk can now be used with Omni managed nodes.
  Omni will impersonate os:admin role for it if the user has write access to the cluster.
