  SzArchiver â€“ Open and Create Sz Files Directly

  The new SzArchiver tool allows you to open Sz files and work with them similar to common zipping tools. Sz files will now have an icon in Windows Explorer and you can just double-click them to see their contents.

  The SzArchiver is free software, it does not contain any license checks and does not need or use an Internet connection.
