  Notable Changes and Bug Fixes
  Cluster dashboard has been updated from 2.7.0 to 2.11.0
  The cluster dashboard has been reimplemented as a Rancher extension and is mostly in sync with the upstream version.
  The dashboard now works correctly even when the KUBECONFIG environment variable points to multiple config files.
  Network fixes
  The gvisor-tap-vsock dependency has been updated again, which has solved several networking regressions from Rancher Desktop 1.17.x (on all platforms).
  Rancher Desktop is working properly again when behind a VPN. On macOS the VZ emulation mode works again even without a network connection.
  Image scanning now scans local images with containerd
  This already worked before for moby.
  Image scanning results are displayed much faster once the vulnerability databases have been downloaded (for images with many vulnerabilities).
  The Open WebUI extension has been updated
  If you already have the extension installed, then you must uninstall it from the "Installed" tab of the "Extensions" page (the "Remove" button on the "Catalog" tab does not work correctly in this release).
  After you have uninstalled the current version, you can install the new version as usual from the "Catalog" tab.
  docker run issues on Windows have been fixed
  docker run on Windows would hang indefinitely when reading from STDIN (#2094) or would produce no output when running without the -i option (#3239). Many thanks to @bcxpro for investigating and fixing this issue!
  nerdctl on Windows picks up compose.yaml automatically
  The nerdctl command on Windows used to run from a separate directory before and therefore did not locate default filenames like compose.yaml correctly. This has been fixed.
  Rancher Desktop is now available as a separate RPM for Fedora
  Deprecations
  MSI installer no longer installs WSL2 on Windows
  WSL2 must be installed on the local system before Rancher Desktop can be installed.
  macOS 12 Monterey and earlier are no longer supported
  Rancher Desktop no longer works on Apple ARM computers running macOS 12 Monterey. It still works on Apple Intel computers, but is unsupported.
