ShortDescription: The industry-leading adaptable Linux operating system.
Description: |-
  SUSE Linux Enterprise (SLE) is an adaptable and easy-to-manage platform that allows developers and administrators to deploy business-critical workloads on-premises, in the cloud and at the edge.
  When it comes to running all your workloads, one size Linux OS does not fit all. That’s why we offer the industry-leading adaptable Linux operating system. No matter what your workload requirements (performance, reliability, operating environment), we have an OS solution purpose-built for your needs.
  SUSE Linux Enterprise has a common code base that runs across so many of your architectures (AMD/Intel x86-64, IBM Z, IBM POWER and Arm64), containers and edge devices – providing the same IT experience, security, and stability across that mixed infrastructure, so you can streamline IT skill sets and systems management and simplify support and services.

  Why SUSE Linux Enterprise?

  SUSE Linux Enterprise is an operating system that is adaptable to any environment – optimized for performance, security and reliability.

  Simplify your IT environment
  The SUSE Linux Enterprise “common code base” platform bridges traditional and software-defined infrastructure. Simplify workload migration, protect your traditional infrastructure, and ease the adoption of containers.

  Modernize your IT infrastructure
  Modernize your IT infrastructure with SUSE Linux Enterprise’s multimodal architecture. With its cloud-agnostic design, SLES can easily transition to public cloud—Alibaba, Azure, AWS, Google, IBM, Oracle.

  Accelerate innovation
  Connect to our developer community at SUSE Package Hub. Once you are ready to move to from development to production you can seamlessly transition from our community Linux distribution - openSUSE Leap - to SUSE Linux Enterprise with just a few clicks.

  Adaptability
  Includes APIs and services that make it possible to write applications that can work with the widest range of architectures, servers, storage and network options available. This approach allows SLES to adapt to any operating environment and enables smooth workload migrations between them.

  Security and Compliance
  SUSE engineers promptly react to security incidents, and deliver premium quality security updates. The configuration, auditing and automation features of SUSE Manager make it easy to ensure compliance with internal security policies and external regulations.
