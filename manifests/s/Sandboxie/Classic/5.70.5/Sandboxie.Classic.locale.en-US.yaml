Description: |-
  Sandboxie is a sandbox-based isolation software for 32- and 64-bit Windows NT-based operating systems.
  It is developed by David Xanatos since it became open source, before that it was developed by Sophos (which acquired it from Invincea, which acquired it earlier from the original author Ronen Tzur).
  It creates a sandbox-like isolated operating environment in which applications can be run or installed without permanently modifying the local or mapped drive.
  Such an isolated virtual environment allows controlled testing of untrusted programs and web surfing.

  This release introduces several important fixes to enhance functionality and improve user experience.A new debugging feature has been added with the inclusion of the HookTrace=y setting, which provides enhanced debugging capabilities for API hooking.The Sandboxie-Plus data folder has been relocated from C:\Users[User]\AppData\Local\Sandboxie-Plus to C:\Users[User]\AppData\Local\Xanasoft\Sandboxie-Plus. This change is automatic for users upgrading to this version, but those downgrading to an older version will need to move the folder back manually. Additionally, some options in the box context menu have been re-ordered for improved usability.This update resolves several critical issues and enhances overall stability. The crash triggered by selecting "Run as Administrator" in the non-advanced view has been fixed, along with a crash caused by missing IP definitions in DNS filtering (#3600, #4475).
  Compatibility with ARM64 systems has been significantly improved, addressing issues such as x64 executables failing to run on Windows 11 ARM64 (#4422, #4415) and resolving compatibility MSEdge and explorer problems with Windows 10 ARM64.Several user experience issues have also been addressed. These include process self-termination failures, infinite loops when Gui_ConnectConsole waited for SbieSvc.exe to quit (#4462), and missing program icons when paths with spaces were specified in the RunCommand setting (#4416).
