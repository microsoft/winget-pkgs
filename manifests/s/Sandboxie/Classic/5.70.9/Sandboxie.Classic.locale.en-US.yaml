Description: |-
  Sandboxie is a sandbox-based isolation software for 32- and 64-bit Windows NT-based operating systems.
  It is developed by David Xanatos since it became open source, before that it was developed by Sophos (which acquired it from Invincea, which acquired it earlier from the original author Ronen Tzur).
  It creates a sandbox-like isolated operating environment in which applications can be run or installed without permanently modifying the local or mapped drive.
  Such an isolated virtual environment allows controlled testing of untrusted programs and web surfing.

  Release Notes
  Sandboxie Plus 1.15.9 delivers a robust update centered on security, stability, and compatibility—particularly for users of modern web browsers and those prioritizing privacy and sandbox integrity.
  A key highlight is the improved compatibility with Firefox 137 Nightly and later, resolving previous hooking issues that caused instability or functional limitations. Firefox now runs smoothly within sandboxed environments once again.
  Security enhancements are another major focus. This release addresses a potential IP leakage vulnerability affecting dual-stack IPv4/IPv6 setups when only one proxy type was configured. Connections now fail gracefully if no proxy is set for the relevant IP type, effectively preventing unintentional bypasses and preserving user anonymity—a critical improvement for users relying on VPNs or proxies.
  Additionally, a serious local privilege escalation vulnerability tied to the HostInjectDll mechanism has been patched, thanks to responsible disclosure. This fix strengthens Sandboxie's role as a secure execution layer.
  For advanced users, a new debug option OpenAllSysCalls=y has been added, allowing unrestricted system call access for testing purposes. However, due to its permissive nature, it should be used with caution.
  Among the usability improvements, users can now duplicate sandboxes and their contents directly from the UI, streamlining environment management. The update also introduces a new developer certificate type that disables user-mode component verification for advanced use cases. This node-locked certificate is available at no additional cost to existing Contributor or Eternal/Huge certificate holders upon request.
  Overall, version 1.15.9 brings a thoughtful balance of new features, critical fixes, and user-focused enhancements, reinforcing Sandboxie Plus as a powerful tool for secure application isolation.
  For a full list of changes please review the change log.
  You can support the project through donations, any help will be greatly appreciated.
  If you have issues with an update installation, just uninstall the previous version keeping the sandboxie.ini and reinstall the new build.
