Description: |-
  Sandboxie is a sandbox-based isolation software for 32- and 64-bit Windows NT-based operating systems.
  It is developed by David Xanatos since it became open source, before that it was developed by Sophos (which acquired it from Invincea, which acquired it earlier from the original author Ronen Tzur).
  It creates a sandbox-like isolated operating environment in which applications can be run or installed without permanently modifying the local or mapped drive.
  Such an isolated virtual environment allows controlled testing of untrusted programs and web surfing.

  Release Notes
  Sandboxie-Plus 1.16.4 / Classic 5.71.4 has been released on October 2nd, 2025. This version introduces a new protection option that blocks non-administrative instances of the session leader, such as Sandman.exe or Sbiectrl.exe, from accessing encrypted box data. This safeguard is enabled by default, though it can be disabled by setting ProtectAdminOnly=n if required. In addition to this enhancement, the release resolves a critical issue where Sandboxie-Plus 1.16.3 failed to connect to the driver on Windows Preview Build 27943, as tracked in issue #5003. Stability has also been improved with a fix for crashes related to the latest Signal client. Furthermore, the internal checks in Thread_CheckObject_CommonEx have been strengthened to provide more robust handling of encrypted boxes. This update continues the project’s focus on reliability, compatibility with evolving Windows builds, and stronger data protection.
  For a full list of changes please review the change log.
  You can support the project through donations, any help will be greatly appreciated.
  If you have issues with an update installation, just uninstall the previous version keeping the sandboxie.ini and reinstall the new build.
