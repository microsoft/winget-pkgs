Description: |-
  Sandboxie is a sandbox-based isolation software for 32- and 64-bit Windows NT-based operating systems.
  It is developed by David Xanatos since it became open source, before that it was developed by Sophos (which acquired it from Invincea, which acquired it earlier from the original author Ronen Tzur).
  It creates a sandbox-like isolated operating environment in which applications can be run or installed without permanently modifying the local or mapped drive.
  Such an isolated virtual environment allows controlled testing of untrusted programs and web surfing.

  Release Notes
  Sandboxie-Plus v1.15.8 / Classic v5.70.8 introduces several improvements and fixes to enhance usability and stability. The sandbox deletion confirmation prompt has been refined for better clarity. The online updater has been updated to ensure smoother updates, and the Plus installer now includes the ImDisk 3.0 driver for 64-bit systems, expanding its functionality.
  This release also addresses key issues reported by users. A problem where the "WriteFilePath" setting was not functioning correctly has been resolved, ensuring expected behavior when writing files. Additionally, an issue with Box Notes that caused matching lines to be deleted upon saving has been fixed, restoring proper note-taking functionality.
  You can support the project through donations, any help will be greatly appreciated.
  If you have issues with an update installation, just uninstall the previous version keeping the sandboxie.ini and reinstall the new build.
