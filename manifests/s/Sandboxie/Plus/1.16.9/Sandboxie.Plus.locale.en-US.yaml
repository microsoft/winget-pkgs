Description: |-
  Sandboxie is a sandbox-based isolation software for 32- and 64-bit Windows NT-based operating systems.
  It is developed by David Xanatos since it became open source, before that it was developed by Sophos (which acquired it from Invincea, which acquired it earlier from the original author Ronen Tzur).
  It creates a sandbox-like isolated operating environment in which applications can be run or installed without permanently modifying the local or mapped drive.
  Such an isolated virtual environment allows controlled testing of untrusted programs and web surfing.

  Release Notes
  This release of Sandboxie Plus focuses on stability, compatibility, and overall robustness across a wide range of real-world use cases. Several long-standing and high-impact issues have been resolved, particularly affecting popular applications such as web browsers, email clients, and Microsoft Office, resulting in a smoother and more reliable sandboxing experience.
  Application compatibility has been significantly improved. Issues affecting recent versions of Thunderbird have been fixed, Firefox no longer triggers AppModel-Runtime errors in the Windows Event Viewer when run inside a sandbox, and Tor Browser is now stable even when operated at the highest security level. Problems specific to portable and sandboxed browser scenarios were also addressed, including a long-standing issue where Chrome Portable tooltips could become stuck.
  System-level stability has been strengthened as well. A critical blue-screen crash in the Sandboxie driver under high GPU process creation load on Windows Server 2022 has been resolved, and crashes that prevented Microsoft Word from functioning correctly due to failures in OfficeClickToRun.exe have been fixed. In addition, Sandboxie now handles software lifecycle operations more efficiently, eliminating prolonged delays when uninstalling or removing applications that were installed exclusively within a sandbox.
  Overall, this release prioritizes reliability and correctness in high-security and high-load environments, making Sandboxie Plus safer and more dependable for everyday use as well as professional and server-side deployments.
  For a full list of changes please review the change log.
  You can support the project through donations, any help will be greatly appreciated.
  If you have issues with an update installation, just uninstall the previous version keeping the sandboxie.ini and reinstall the new build.
