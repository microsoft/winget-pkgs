Description: |-
  Sandboxie is a sandbox-based isolation software for 32- and 64-bit Windows NT-based operating systems.
  It is developed by David Xanatos since it became open source, before that it was developed by Sophos (which acquired it from Invincea, which acquired it earlier from the original author Ronen Tzur).
  It creates a sandbox-like isolated operating environment in which applications can be run or installed without permanently modifying the local or mapped drive.
  Such an isolated virtual environment allows controlled testing of untrusted programs and web surfing.

  Release Notes
  In this update, several improvements and fixes have been introduced to enhance the stability and functionality of Sandboxie Plus.
  A new capability has been added to the service, allowing it to log monitor events, providing users with additional insights and diagnostics.
  The Notepad++ template has been updated to ensure compatibility with Sandboxie Classic, improving usability for users of the legacy version. Additionally, MiscHelpers.dll has been updated with enhancements to the finder, contributing to improved performance and reliability.
  Several issues have been resolved in this release. Obsolete entries in the Sandboxie Plus installer have been removed, ensuring a cleaner installation process. An issue where pinned shortcuts created via the 'Run from Start Menu' option were non-functional has been fixed, addressing reported concerns (#4502). A potential Blue Screen of Death (BSoD) issue with the driver under low-resource conditions has been resolved, improving overall system stability.
  Further refinements include fixing a crash occurring in NsiAllocateAndGetTable, thanks to a report from tzf-omkey (#4511). Additionally, two memory leaks have been addressed: one occurring when a sandboxed process received a device change notification, and another affecting the NtQueryDirectoryFile hook, which previously manifested in privacy-enhanced sandboxes (#4509).
  This update ensures a more robust and efficient experience for Sandboxie Plus users. As always, feedback and reports from the community are invaluable in maintaining and improving the software.
  For a full list of changes please review the change log.
