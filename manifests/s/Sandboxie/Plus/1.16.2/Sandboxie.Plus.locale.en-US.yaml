Description: |-
  Sandboxie is a sandbox-based isolation software for 32- and 64-bit Windows NT-based operating systems.
  It is developed by David Xanatos since it became open source, before that it was developed by Sophos (which acquired it from Invincea, which acquired it earlier from the original author Ronen Tzur).
  It creates a sandbox-like isolated operating environment in which applications can be run or installed without permanently modifying the local or mapped drive.
  Such an isolated virtual environment allows controlled testing of untrusted programs and web surfing.

  Release Notes
  The final release of Sandboxie-Plus version 1.16.2 / 5.71.2 consolidates and builds upon the significant advancements introduced in the recent pre-releases, delivering a more secure, compatible, and modernized sandboxing experience.
  This version marks a major step forward in platform modernization. The underlying codebase has been updated to the MSVC 2022 toolset, while the user interface has migrated from Qt 5 to Qt 6. These changes provide better performance, improved security, and access to newer development features. However, they also necessitate the discontinuation of support for Windows 7 and 32-bit systems. Depending on user interest, an Extended Support Release (ESR) for older systems may be considered.
  The update further refines usability and functionality. A new INI key validation feature, complete with per-key tooltips, has been integrated into the INI section editor, making advanced configuration safer and more accessible. SandMan now also supports an optional Windows 11-style visual theme, enhancing UI consistency on modern systems.
  A major new feature allows administrators to redirect all files marked with the "Mark of the Web" into a designated sandbox, improving security by isolating potentially unsafe downloads. Forced process rules now support wildcards, and virtual sandboxes can be created without being written into the main configuration file, ideal for temporary or dynamically managed setups.
  Under the hood, the DNS filter logic has been hardened to prevent unresolved domains from bypassing filtering, addressing a potential security flaw.
  Additional improvements to system object handling now cover EventPair, KeyedEvent, and Timer types, enhancing compatibility with more applications.
  The UAC subsystem can now invoke Sandboxie's own prompt, capable of simulating administrative rights without actual elevation, for more secure testing scenarios.
  This release also addresses a range of bugs. Issues with incomplete shortcut paths, broken network adapter isolation, misinterpreted backslash-prefixed file paths, and language mismatches during installation have been resolved. The UAC prompt layout has been visually refined, and a long-standing fullscreen issue with Firefoxâ€™s taskbar behavior has been fixed. Moreover, Firefox compatibility has been improved for both stable and Nightly builds, resolving recent hook-related failures. An important security issue involving sandbox key leaks during encrypted volume password changes has also been mitigated by backporting hardened logic from MajorPrivacy.
  Together, these changes offer a more future-proof, stable, and secure experience for Sandboxie-Plus users.
  For a full list of changes please review the change log.
  You can support the project through donations, any help will be greatly appreciated.
  If you have issues with an update installation, just uninstall the previous version keeping the sandboxie.ini and reinstall the new build.
