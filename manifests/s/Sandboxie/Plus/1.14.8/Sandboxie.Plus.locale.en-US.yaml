Description: |-
  Sandboxie is a sandbox-based isolation software for 32- and 64-bit Windows NT-based operating systems.
  It is developed by David Xanatos since it became open source, before that it was developed by Sophos (which acquired it from Invincea, which acquired it earlier from the original author Ronen Tzur).
  It creates a sandbox-like isolated operating environment in which applications can be run or installed without permanently modifying the local or mapped drive.
  Such an isolated virtual environment allows controlled testing of untrusted programs and web surfing.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  In this release, we have introduced several new features and improvements that significantly enhance the user experience and provide greater flexibility in system operations. Most notably, users can now effortlessly obtain free 10-day evaluation certificates directly from the support settings page within the UI. These certificates are hardware-locked to the user's machine and allow for up to three requests per hardware ID, making it easier to test and evaluate the system with minimal setup.Furthermore, new options have been added to increase privacy and security, such as the ability to modify the Windows Product ID in the registry to a random value and to return random values for disk serial numbers and network adapter MAC addresses when queried by applications. These features add an extra layer of obfuscation to protect against unwanted system identification.Other enhancements include the ability to terminate all processes when Sandman exits, a new option for configuring DropConHostIntegrity directly from the UI, and an improved shared template feature in the New Box Wizard. The number of available shared templates has increased to 10, and the template names can now be easily updated by adjusting the corresponding settings.In terms of fixes, we have addressed several key issues, including improving the "HideDiskSerialNumber" functionality to prevent application crashes, correcting the format of encrypted proxy passwords, and resolving an issue related to the "NtQueryDirectoryObject" function to avoid easy sandbox detection. These updates contribute to a more stable and secure environment for users.For a full list of changes and fixes please review the full change log.You can support the project through donations, any help will be greatly appreciated.
  If you have issues with an update installation, just uninstall the previous version keeping the sandboxie.ini and reinstall the new build.
