Description: |-
  Sandboxie is a sandbox-based isolation software for 32- and 64-bit Windows NT-based operating systems.
  It is developed by David Xanatos since it became open source, before that it was developed by Sophos (which acquired it from Invincea, which acquired it earlier from the original author Ronen Tzur).
  It creates a sandbox-like isolated operating environment in which applications can be run or installed without permanently modifying the local or mapped drive.
  Such an isolated virtual environment allows controlled testing of untrusted programs and web surfing.

  Release Notes
  This release delivers several important fixes and a key compatibility improvement to enhance the overall reliability and user experience of Sandboxie-Plus. A issue affecting Windows 7 users introduced in 1.16.5 has been resolved, ensuring that the program can once again establish a proper connection to the driver on this platform. Compatibility with recent Firefox Nightly builds (version 146) has also been addressed, allowing the browser to run correctly within the sandbox environment. This version also introduces a change to the default configuration: the UseWin32kHooks=y option is now enabled by default for all sandboxed processes. This adjustment significantly improves compatibility with Electron-based applications, reducing issues that some users previously experienced.
  Overall, Sandboxie-Plus 1.16.6 / 5.71.6 continues the effort to refine system compatibility, stability, and performance across both legacy and modern Windows systems.
  For a full list of changes please review the change log.
  You can support the project through donations, any help will be greatly appreciated.
  If you have issues with an update installation, just uninstall the previous version keeping the sandboxie.ini and reinstall the new build.
