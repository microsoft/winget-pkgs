Description: |-
  Sandboxie is a sandbox-based isolation software for 32- and 64-bit Windows NT-based operating systems.
  It is developed by David Xanatos since it became open source, before that it was developed by Sophos (which acquired it from Invincea, which acquired it earlier from the original author Ronen Tzur).
  It creates a sandbox-like isolated operating environment in which applications can be run or installed without permanently modifying the local or mapped drive.
  Such an isolated virtual environment allows controlled testing of untrusted programs and web surfing.

  Release Notes
  Sandboxie Plus version 1.15.12 / 5.70.12 introduces a range of enhancements, fixes, and usability improvements. This release adds Indonesian language support to the Plus UI, a new template for the WeType Input Method Editor (IME), and support for proxy configuration using host names instead of raw IPs by resolving them at WSA_Startup. Sandboxie can now bind to network adapters rather than specific IP addresses, providing more flexibility in networking setups. Additionally, support for the %ProgramFiles(x86)% environment variable has been introduced, along with a new TemplateDefaultFolders entry to define standard paths in privacy-enhanced boxes.
  Several changes improve usability and performance. The "Move Sandbox" list sorting behavior has been refined, and personal details like name and hardware ID in the Support tab are now hidden by default. An experimental alternative proxy relay implementation has also been added, shifting from socket modification to relay threads.
  Numerous issues have been addressed. These include the BoxAlias not appearing in the "run in box" dialog, UI inconsistencies after using Ctrl+F, and persistent high I/O usage by SbieCtrl.exe and SandMan.exe. Registry access functions were hardened with additional checks, and problems with Tencent TIM, MSI installer behavior, and oversized Sandboxie.ini files have been resolved. Other fixes address UI glitches, translation inconsistencies, drag-and-drop issues, and crashes related to SbieDll.dll. Compatibility problems with PingInfoView and a loop condition in CollectProducts() have also been fixed.
  For a full list of changes please review the change log.
