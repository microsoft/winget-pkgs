ShortDescription: Sandboxie is a sandbox-based isolation software for 32- and 64-bit Windows NT-based operating systems.
Description: |-
  Sandboxie is a sandbox-based isolation software for 32- and 64-bit Windows NT-based operating systems.
  It was developed by Sophos (which acquired it from Invincea, which acquired it earlier from the original author Ronen Tzur).
  It creates a sandbox-like isolated operating environment in which applications can be run or installed without permanently modifying the local or mapped drive.
  Such an isolated virtual environment allows controlled testing of untrusted programs and web surfing.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  - The RAMDisks integration is available to all project supporters with a valid supporter certificate, it allows for seamless RAMDisk usage once configured on the add-on options settings page and enabled for selected sandboxes.
    The RAMDisk can be mounted without a drive letter providing a seamless experience, the appropriate Folders on the shared RAMDisk are linked to the default box root folder locations.
    The RAMDisk is NOT persistent this means that all data stored on the RAMDisk vanish once the system is rebooted, making such a sand box ideal to store transient confidential data.
  - The Encrypted Box Image feature uses encrypted container files to store a boxes root directory (containing all files and the boxes registry hive) the mounted encrypted volume is by default guarded by the driver such that only processes runnign within the sandbox (and essential sbie+ components) can access the files stored on that volume.
    In combination with the "ConfidentialBox=y" option, host process read access to sandboxed processes memory is effectively blocked, ensuring no rogue process on the host can access confidential data in RAM belonging to sandboxed processes.
    The combination of this mechanisms creates secure enclaves, which ensure data processed within an enclave can not leak to the host (except for user configured OpenFilePath locations) and is protected even when the host would to be compromised (only adversaries which obtained kernel level privileges can bypass these mechanisms).
