  Important Note
  1. The Live View Analytics app is no longer supported starting from this version.
  2. Adjusted the H.265 software decoding mechanism. For Windows 11 versions released before 2022 H1, please install the Windows HEVC Video Extensions app from the Microsoft Store to watch H.265 videos. This app is pre-installed in newer versions of Windows, so no additional installation is required. If your computer supports H.265 hardware decoding, installing this app is not necessary.
  3. The mechanisms of Fisheye Dewarping have been updated to improve system efficiency. For H.264 cameras, you can use the original mechanism by going to Application > Options > Advanced and enabling fisheye dewarping compatibility mode.
  4. The Smart Search app is no longer supported for H.265 cameras.
