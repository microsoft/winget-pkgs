  Fixed Issues
  1. Fixed an issue where, when playing more than 20 live video feeds in Sync mode, Monitor Center was limited to switching and playing only 20 streams during the first playback attempt. Streams beyond the 20th might not be played.
  2. Fixed a security vulnerability. (Synology-SA-24:05)
