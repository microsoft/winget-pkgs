ReleaseNotes: |-
  Hotfix for multi-instance. Woops! Original changelog below:
  Changes
  - Add deep-link support
    - This means things like discord://-/channels/x/y/z should now open in Dorion properly!
  - Add transparent option to window blur options, which is supported by all platforms
  - Fix middle click link behaviour
  - Re-enabled LTO, should make Dorion faster (in ways you will probably never notice)
  - Update a bunch of external dependencies
  In other news
  I've been working on an alternative Discord overlay compatible with not only Dorion, but other clients (official, 3rd party, even web!) as well. You can find it here if you are interested: https://github.com/SpikeHD/Orbolay
