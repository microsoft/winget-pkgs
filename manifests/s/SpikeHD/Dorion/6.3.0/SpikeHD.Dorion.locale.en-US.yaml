ReleaseNotes: |-
  Changes
  - A bunch of internal rsRPC changes to make it better and more efficient
  - Add INVITE_BROWSER support using rsRPC
      - This means that opening a server invite in the browser will automatically open it in Dorion now!
  - Add more fine-grained configuration for the integrated RPC server
  - Add full --os-accent CSS variable support for themes that use it
  - Windows notifications now show the user's icon
  - Add proxy configuration
      - This does not have a section in the UI, because if you require a proxy to access Discord, then you can't access the settings to begin with!
      - Instead, add your proxy server to Dorion's config.json manually.
  - Fix some fullscreen behaviour
  - Fix showing window on macOS (#267)
