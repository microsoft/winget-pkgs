ReleaseNotes: |-
  Changes
  - Update to tauri v2.2.0
  - User-agent is now set to an OS-specific UA
  - User-agent now reflects actual Webview2 version on Windows
      - Apparently in super rare cases, if this wasn't implemented, it would cause your account to be flagged for spamming. Dorion only ever had one report of this happening, lol
  - Clicking a notification now focuses Dorion
  - Re-adds Windows 7 notification behaviour
  - Use shelter's new(ish) "injector" pattern, which should prevent some confusion
      - This basically just means that Dorion plugins show up in the plugins list with an info icon stating "This plugin is part of Dorion"
      - This also means Dorion settings show up slightly higher in the list
  - Rework a fair amount of notification behaviour
  - Many rsRPC fixes and improvements
  - Fix top bar when using light mode (#273 from @luximus-hunter)
  - Fix safemode
  - Fix window not remembering position (#272)
