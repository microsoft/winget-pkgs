  Changes
  - Add new keybinds system
    - This system should be way better and should support many more keys

    - If you prefer Vencord's, don't worry, this plugin disables itself automatically when it detects that Vencord's version is enabled
    - This plugin is incomplete, but PRs are open!
  - Add new, very slightly different tray icons for Windows
  - Update rsRPC to v0.25.0, it should now be even faster and even more efficient
