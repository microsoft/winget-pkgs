  Changes
  - Strip debug symbols and enable LTO, which results in a slightly smaller binary across all platforms- For example, the Windows binary has decreased to ~12.982mb from ~13.956mb (v4.1.1)

  - Update git dependencies, such as tauri-plugin-window-state, which should make some features more stable
  - Fix file previews (and probably other things)
