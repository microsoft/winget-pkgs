ReleaseNotes: |-
  Changes
  - Greatly improve RPC process scanning performance
  - Fix scanning Wine games (Linux)
    - I may have forgotten to mention this in a previous release, but RPC should now work on Linux
  Other notes
  Apparently shelteRPC was semi-busted and nobody told me ðŸ˜ . That has been hotfixed in my shelter-plugins repo (activity assets (eg. images) won't load for now, but when shelteRPC updates to fix that, you will get the update automatically)
