  FPS Unlocker
  1.  Migrated from .NET 9 to .NET 10.
  2.  Migrated from VS2022 to VS2026.
  3.  Optimized game process detection: now uses GetProcessesByName instead of iterating through all processes.
  4.  Changed the base type of the IpcStatus enum to sbyte for memory optimization.
  5.  Fixed a handle leak in SetupForm.PollProcess(): process handles are now properly closed when the window does not belong to the game.

  11. Moved all hardcoded MessageBox strings to Resources to support localization.
