  7.177.1 (Nov 17, 2022) [stable]
  - FIX: The force:org:status command is working correctly and no longer returns the error MediaType of 'application/json,application/json' is not supported by this resource. (sfdx-core PR #697)
  - FIX: The force:org:create command correctly fires configured postorgcreate hooks. (GitHub issue #1722, plugin-org PR #485)
  - FIX: The force:package:beta:version:create command includes and installs unpackaged metadata so package version create with code coverage is working correctly. (GitHub issue #1743, packaging PR #117)
  - FIX: The force:package:beta:version:create command adds dependencies in the packageDirectories section of the sfdx-project.json file using the correct package key rather than the incorrect subscriberPackageVersionId key. (GitHub issue #1764, packaging PR #117)
  - FIX: The force:package:beta:version:create command correctly creates a package version and no longer returns the error Converting circular structure to JSON. (GitHub issue #1789)
  - FIX: The force:package:beta:version:list command correctly outputs the datetime values in the Created Date and Last Modified Date columns using the user's locale rather than UTC. (GitHub issue #1794, plugin-packaging PR #152)
  - FIX: The force:mdapi:deploy command correctly deploys and returns the expected response. It would unexpectedly exit on very large files in 7.176.1 and 7.177.0. Special thanks to Andrew Goodman for helping find the root cause. (Github issue #1802, source-deploy-retrieve PR #768)
