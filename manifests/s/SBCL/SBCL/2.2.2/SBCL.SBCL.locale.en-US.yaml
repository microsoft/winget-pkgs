  changes in sbcl-2.2.2 relative to sbcl-2.2.1:
  • platform support:
    •• all architectures now share the coverage mark instrumentation implementation, meaning that performance now equals what had been implemented only on x86 architectures.
    •• fixed a performance regression on x86-64 from changes in AVX2 register handling.  (lp#1960081, reported by Michael Kappert)
    •• fixed a garbage collection bug on ppc64 manifesting in occasional corruption on threaded programs.  (lp#1959338, lp#1952973)
    •• micro-optimizations in type tests for (SIGNED-BYTE 64).
  • enhancement: improved handling of source locations for some classes of compile time and runtime errors.
  • enhancement: better source locations for structure accessors.
  • bug fix: SB-COVER now always instruments top level forms correctly.
  • bug fix: muffling conditions now works correctly on higher debug settings.
  • bug fix: local muffling declarations now scope correctly with respect to undefined variable warnings.
  • optimization: calls to STRING= can now return NIL more quickly on strings of unequal length.
