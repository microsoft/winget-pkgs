ReleaseNotes: |-
  changes in sbcl-2.2.3 relative to sbcl-2.2.2:
  • minor incompatible change: SB-THREAD:MUTEX-OWNER may return :THREAD-DEAD
    if the apparent owner either exited nearly instantly after releasing the
    mutex (and is not now the owner), or died and never released it.
  • minor incompatible change: building the system with the simple semi-space
    copying collector is no longer supported.
  • minor incompatible change: support for PPC/Darwin has been removed.
  • platform support:
    • fix regressions in threads on RISC-V.  (lp#1962598)
    • threads are now enabled by default on RISC-V.
    • The generational garbage collector is now supported on MIPS.
  • optimization: fasls containing standard object literals are now smaller
    and load more efficiently.
  • optimization: faster arithmetic (*-+) on word-sized integers when the
    result is not known to fit into a word (ARM64 and x86-64).
  • bug fix: EQness of constants is now always preserved when block compiling.
