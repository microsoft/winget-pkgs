License: Proprietary # Manifest validate requires a license, see below for more information to know why I fill this field with "Proprietary". 
# License: GPL - This is the license of the Stremio shell, not the Stremio app, and the license of the app is not specified. (but it's probably proprietary, by Copilot)
# Also, in the original manifest, the manifest author did not explicitly specify the GPL license version, which is a serious mistake (different versions of the GPL license cannot be mixed). :(
