ShortDescription: Drop any files to any devices on your LAN
Description: |-
  LANDrop automatically detects other devices running LANDrop on the same Wi-Fi network, so you don't need to enter IP addresses manually. Unlike other apps, there's no need to set up a server. LANDrop handles everything behind the scenes—just like AirDrop, but cross-platform.

  - LANDrop uses advanced protocols to deliver line-rate transfer speeds along with military-grade encryption and authentication for top-notch security.
  - On the go? No worries—LANDrop works with your personal hotspot, without using cellular data.
  - LANDrop transfers your photos and videos without any compression, ensuring they remain high quality.
  - LANDrop can detect nearby devices even if they're not on the same Wi-Fi network. Using WebRTC, it enables file transfers to those devices.
  - Add trusted devices in LANDrop and automatically accept file transfers from them without needing approval each time.
