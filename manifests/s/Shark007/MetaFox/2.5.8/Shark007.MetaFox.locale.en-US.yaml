ShortDescription: >
  MetaFox is a simple to use MKV video file converter/multiplexer with a few
  steps.
Description: >
  You drag'n'drop a file or even an entire folder onto the shortcut and it will
  create copies of the originals in the MKV format. This tool is especially
  useful to Windows 7/10 users who have trouble with thumbnails or video
  playback. MetaFox converts/remuxes HEVC, AVI, MOV, MP4, MPG, FLV, RMVB, etc...
  to MKV files. MetaFox will not reconvert any video/audio but only remux it to
  a mkv file container so you will not lose any video/audio quality.
