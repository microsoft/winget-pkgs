ShortDescription: A Matrix Client based on Element with a more traditional instant messaging experience
ReleaseNotes: |-
  Finally a new release! üê¢The codebase is now updated to Element v1.11.36.
  There are no functional changes or new features, only security fixes (including the backported electron security fixes).This release gives us hopefully enough time to get a new codebase up and running, because stuff broke with almost every new Element release, so it became basically unmaintainable the current way for me alone.
  Every feature increases the likelihood of merge conflicts. The current state is that others provided feature PRs or I implemented requested features, but I couldn't just maintain them in the long run.
  Thus, my long term plan is to extract single features into feature branches and apply them on top of a slim schildi base with every new Element release.
  My hope is that others will chime in for maintaining additional features and occasional other fixes and improvements to the base.
  With this new architecture, hopefully, I'm relieved of some of the pain, because it's easier for others to contribute (also for adapting features to new Element releases).PS: The appearance settings are visually broken, but they are functionally intact. I won't fix that anymore for the current codebase.
