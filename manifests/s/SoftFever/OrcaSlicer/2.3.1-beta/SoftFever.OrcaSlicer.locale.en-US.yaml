  What's Changed
  This is OrcaSlicer V2.3.1 beta release. It fixes some bugs found in 2.3.1-alpha and adds some new features.
  - Add a new feature that allow user to insert extra solid infills by @SoftFever in https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer/pull/10611
    Insert extra solid infills at specific layers to add strength at critical points in your print. This feature allows you to strategically reinforce your part without changing the overall sparse infill density.

    The pattern supports two formats:
    Interval Pattern
    - Simple interval: N - Insert 1 solid layer every N layers, equal to N#1
    - Multiple layers: N#K - Insert K consecutive solid layers every N layers
    - Optional K: N# - Shorthand for N#1
    Examples:
    5 or 5#1    # Insert 1 solid layer every 5 layers
    5#          # Same as 5#1
    10#2        # Insert 2 consecutive solid layers every 10 layers
    Explicit Layer List
    Specify exact layer numbers (1-based) using comma-separated values. Each entry may be a single layer N or a range N#K to insert K consecutive solid layers starting at layer N:
    1,7,9       # Insert solid layers at layers 1, 7, and 9
    5,15,25     # Insert solid layers at layers 5, 15, and 25
    5,9#2,18    # Insert at 5; at 9 and 10 (because #2); and at 18
    [!NOTE]
    - Layer numbers are 1-based (first layer is layer 1)
    - #K is optional in both interval and explicit list entries (N# equals N#1)
    - Solid layers are inserted in addition to the normal sparse infill pattern
    [!TIP]
    Use this feature to:
    - Add strength at stress concentration points
    - Reinforce mounting holes or attachment points
    - Create internal structure for functional parts
    - Add periodic reinforcement for tall prints
    - Insert a single solid layer at a specific height by using an explicit list with a leading 0, which will be ignored because layer indices are 1-based. Example: 0,15 inserts a solid layer only at layer 15.
    [!WARNING]
    Layers that include solid infill can take significantly longer than surrounding layers. This time differential may lead to z-banding-like bulges. Consider adjusting cooling or speeds if you observe artifacts.
  - Refactor infill rotation by @SoftFever in https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer/pull/10587
    This update enhances the user experience and logic of the infill rotation controls by making "Sparse infill direction" and "Sparse infill rotation template" mutually exclusive to avoid conflicts. When the "Sparse infill rotation template" is active (non-empty), both "Sparse infill direction" and the automatic 90-degree rotation logic for certain patterns (e.g., Line pattern) are automatically disabled for clearer behavior.
    Solid infill handling has been improved by removing the solid infill insertion code from the sparse infill rotation template system, as this functionality was misplaced in 2.3.1-alpha. A dedicated option has been added for this feature (see change note above). The previous implementation caused issues where solid infill was incorrectly inserted directly above sparse infill.
    The overall infill rotation logic has been refactored for better maintainability and clarity, also resolving a critical regression where auto internal bridge infill direction was not functioning correctly in 2.3.1-alpha (#10469).
  - Fix a regression bug in 2.3.1-alpha where Rectilinear infill generates unoptimized toolpaths. by @SoftFever in https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer/pull/10649
  - Fix a bug where Orca didn't allow exporting the "Printer Config Bundle" in certain cases. by @Azio-Pantheon in https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer/pull/10380
  - Improve Fisher koch Infill Precision by @RF47 in https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer/pull/10428
    Improved curved infill pattern quality by replacing lookup tables with direct trigonometric functions, eliminating grid artifacts and delivering naturally smooth curves with full floating-point precision. This enhancement produces more accurate, visually appealing infill patterns while improving performance.
  - Optimize 3DHoneycomb infill: avoid using bridge flow by @gringer in https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer/pull/10453
  - Ignore the precise outer wall option when the wall sequence is not set to InnerOuter. by @SoftFever in https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer/pull/10687
