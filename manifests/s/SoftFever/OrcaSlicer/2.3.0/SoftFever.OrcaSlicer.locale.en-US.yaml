ReleaseNotes: |-
  This is the official release of Orca Slicer v2.3.0, a stable version that we highly recommend for all users.
  Note: If you upgrade from OrcaSlicer 2.2 or an older version, there’s a chance that some of your previously custom filaments are now available to all your printers. However, if this isn’t what you want, you can set the filament’s dependency to restrict it to a specific printer. For custom filament settings created with 2.3, it will automatically set to be compatible with the current printer model only. In the following video, I demonstrate how to change my “Aliz PETG @Voron” filament, which is optimized for my Voron machine and won’t work with my other printers. I set its dependency to make it visible only to my Voron machine.
