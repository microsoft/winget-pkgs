ReleaseNotes: "What's Changed\nThis is OrcaSlicer V2.0.0 beta release.\nThis update introduces innovative new features and a lot of bug fixes and improvements.- Scarf joint seam: an innovative apprach to hide seams for FDM printing by @NoisyfoxYou probably have already heard of the \"scarf joint\" feature implemented in OrcaSlicer through forum/YouTube videos.\nIt's a exicting new way to hide the seams in FDM printing.\nimagescarfMain implementation is done by @Noisyfox in #3839Conditional scarf joint and slowdown for scarf joint only feature is done by @SoftFever in #4317A big shoutout to @vgdh and @MichaelJLew for coming up with this brilliant idea and the early-stage prototypeA heartfelt thank you to everyone who participated in the testing and discussion, look at how many people are involved in the PR thread!\nimageAdam(@psiberfunk) has done incredible scientific experiments. He wrote a great guide on how to use this feature, do check it out.Michael(TeachingTech) made a fantastic YouTube video to explain this feature, do check it out.\n- Small area flow compensation by @mjonuschat in #3334\nA feature aimed at addressing the challenge of over-extrusion in small areas of solid infill, an issue previously not well understood. By implementing a strategy that adjusts extrusion flow inversely proportional to the length of the extrusion line, we ensure that shorter lines receive less flow. This approach is visually represented in the software, with color coding—blue for reduced flow and red for increased flow—to clearly show the effect of the adjustments. This feature is designed to enhance print quality by providing a practical solution to the over-extrusion problem, making it easier for users to achieve consistent results across their prints.image\nimageBig shoutout to @Alexander-T-Moss, who first came up with this innovative improvement and implemented it with scripts.\n- Orca Slicer now support OTA profile update for all 3d printers by @SoftFever in #4069\nimage\n- QoL: 3D navigator by @Noisyfox in #4181viewbox\nYou can turn it off in menu\n- Improve gap fill application strategy by @igiannakas in #3412gap fill\n- Add direct adaptive bed mesh support by @SoftFever in #4212Orca Slicer introduces comprehensive support for adaptive bed meshing across a variety of firmware, including Marlin, Klipper, and RepRapFirmware (RRF).\nThis feature allows users to seamlessly integrate adaptive bed mesh commands within the Machine Start G-code.\nThe implementation is designed to be straightforward, requiring no additional plugins or alterations to firmware settings, thereby enhancing user experience and print quality directly from Orca Slicer.\nCompared to existing adaptive bed mesh plugins for Klipper, the Orca Slicer implementation can handle max/min bed mesh safety limits to avoid potential crashing into the bed.\nFor detailed usage, please refer to the Orca Slicer WIKI.\nExample of Adaptive Bed Mesh usage in Orca Slicer:Marlin:\n\nG29 X{bed_mesh_probe_count[0]} Y{bed_mesh_probe_count[1]} L{adaptive_bed_mesh_min[0]} R{adaptive_bed_mesh_max[0]} F{adaptive_bed_mesh_min[1]} B{adaptive_bed_mesh_max[1]} T V4\n\nKlipper:\n\n; Always pass `ADAPTIVE_MARGIN=0` because Orca has already handled `adaptive_bed_mesh_margin` internally\nBED_MESH_CALIBRATE mesh_min={adaptive_bed_mesh_min[0]},{adaptive_bed_mesh_min[1]} mesh_max={adaptive_bed_mesh_max[0]},{adaptive_bed_mesh_max[1]} ALGORITHM=[bed_mesh_algo] PROBE_COUNT={bed_mesh_probe_count[0]},{bed_mesh_probe_count[1]} ADAPTIVE=1 ADAPTIVE_MARGIN=0\n\nRRF:\n\nM557 X{adaptive_bed_mesh_min[0]}:{adaptive_bed_mesh_max[0]} Y{adaptive_bed_mesh_min[1]}:{adaptive_bed_mesh_max[1]} P{bed_mesh_probe_count[0]}:{bed_mesh_probe_count[1]}  \n\n\n- Allow specifying print order within each layer by @Noisyfox in #3685\nYou can now adjust the print order of objects in \"by layer\" mode by dragging them in the object list. Choosing the \"as object list\" option from the layer order dropdown will ensure objects are printed in your specified order for each layer.\nimage\n- Revist and improve \"ensure vertical thickness\" strategy and UX by @igiannakas and @SoftFever in #3235 and #4402ensure\n- Add a new handy model: Orca string hell by @SoftFever in #3892stringhell\n- UX: check and warn users if print speed/accel/jerk are higher than the machine limits by @SoftFever in #4403\nmotion_limit\n- Improve pressure equalizer so that it's less aggressive by @Noisyfox in #4264\nimage\n- [Feature] Introduced option to control amount of internal bridging, fixing internal bridge missing for some sloped surfaces by @igiannakas in #3319\nimage\n- Port EditGCodeDialog from PrusaSlicer by @Ocraftyone in #3417\ngcode\n- Port \"counterbole hole bridging\" feature from SuperSlicer(it's called \"No Unsupported Perimeters\" in SS) by @Ocraftyone and @Noisyfox in #3189counterbole\n- Fixed a bug that in edge cases, wrong top surfaces were detected by @SoftFever in #4244\n- Improvement: Corrected monotonic lines now respect user infill / wall overlap setting by @igiannakas in #3388\n- Add configurable short wall/perimeter cleaning for Arachne by @scottmudge in #2790\n- Fix #3311: filament Load / Unload time was not used in time estimation by @eoyilmaz in #3706\n- Add shell type to STEP importer, to fix importing of some STEP files by @scottmudge in #4247\n- Pressure equalizer documentation by @igiannakas in #4334\n- Improve PA tower: 1. support large nozzles 2. remove jerk=1 settings 3. move settings changes to object to avoid accidently saving the profile by @SoftFever in #4382\n- Support for Obico cloud integration by @kennethjiang in #4116For more detailed guild, please check this page: https://obico.io/docs/user-guides/orca-slicer-integration/\n- Allow specify wall directions by @Noisyfox in #4156\n- ENH: Better Scrolling Over Multiline Fields by @Ocraftyone in #4218\n- Improve ExtrusionLine::simplify, eliminating many very-short extrusion segments which led to blemishes in thin-wall models sliced with Arachne -
