ReleaseNotes: |-
  This is the official release of OrcaSlicer V2.1.0

  This update includes minor fixes and new translations.
  For a detailed list of all the new features, please refer to the release notes for [v2.1.0](https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer/releases/tag/v2.1.0-beta) [Beta](https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer/releases/tag/v2.1.0-beta) and [V2.1.0 RC](https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer/releases/tag/v2.1.0-rc)

  What's Changed
    - Improved fuzzy skin by @SeaRyanC in https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer/pull/5682
      The enhancements introduced in OrcaSlicer V2.1.0 RC were not properly highlighted earlier, so I'd like to reintroduce them now. Previously, the fuzzy skin displayed subtle patterns along the Z direction. With the latest improvements, the fuzziness has been made truly uniform and random.
