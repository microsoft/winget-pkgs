  What's Changed
    - Add overhang threshold for scarf joint seam by @SoftFever in #4725

    This is the latest effort in the ongoing improvement of the scarf joint seam. This new feature introduces an overhang threshold for the scarf joint seam, allowing users to set a threshold for the overhang angle to prevent the application of the scarf joint seam. This improvement is based on the observation that the scarf joint seam, in general, doesn't play well with steep overhangs.

    Meanwhile, the 'Scarf joint flow ratio' option has been moved to dev mode only, as its utility remains unclear based on testing results. Thanks to Adam (@psiberfunk) for the testing and feedback. You can enable dev mode to use this feature.
