    - Virtual Desktop Support
      - If you want to move the current Hardcopy window (with its contents) to the
        current desktop, click "Open Hardcopy Window" in the system tray.
      - If a Hardcopy function is clicked in the System Tray, the function is executed
        on the current desktop and the Hardcopy window is also opened on that desktop.
        (For example, the "Rectangle" function is now executed on the current
        desktop.)
      - If you click the Hardcopy-Printer-Icon or use a keyboard function (e.g., the
        "Print Screen" key), editing takes place in the current Hardcopy window, even
        if this window is open on another desktop. If you use the "Open Hardcopy
        Window" option for this function, the Hardcopy window will open on the current
        desktop.
