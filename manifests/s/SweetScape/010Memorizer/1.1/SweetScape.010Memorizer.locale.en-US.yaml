ShortDescription: Memorize Numbers with Ease
Description: 'Do you have trouble remembering phone numbers, PINs, social insurance numbers, etc.? 010 Memorizer is a program designed to help you easily remember numbers. The basic idea is that it is easier to remember vivid images, like orange juice gushing out of a geyser, then a number like 39174306. Using 010 Memorizer, you can convert a number into a word or phrase that forms an image in your mind. The conversion between numbers and words is done by phonetics: certain consonant sounds represent certain numbers and vowels act as fillers. 010 Memorizer helps you with this conversion by listing all words that can be used to memorize a number, and you just have to pick a word or phrase that you find easy to remember.'
