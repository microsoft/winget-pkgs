ShortDescription: Free software for checking signed and sealed documents and time stamps
Description: Documents with an electronic signature ensure legally compliant business processes in the digital world. They are sent by e-mail after signing. The recipient of the signed electronic document can easily check this with the digiSeal® reader from secrypt – and thus determine its authenticity (truthfulness) and integrity (non-genuine). The widely used inspection software is thus designed for the verification of individual digitally signed documents at the workplace, e. g. electronically signed contracts (eContracts), expert opinions and invoices (e. g. according to the ZUGFeRD standard).
