ShortDescription: Sonic Robo Blast 2 is a 3D Sonic the Hedgehog fangame based on a modified version of Doom Legacy.
ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Removed the framerate limit: Using interpolation, SRB2 can now run at far more than 35fps, allowing for smoother looking 60fps gameplay (or much higher on supported monitors).
    You can set a custom limit at the bottom of Video Options.
  - Fixed error 503: This prevented some players from accessing the ingame Master Server browser.
    If you’ve been having trouble using the Master Server, give it another try.
  - Support larger characters in ERZ: Addon characters with large collision boxes, such as Ryder the Falcon, can now complete ERZ.
    We introduced some new gravity-related elements you can add to your maps as a part of this fix.
    Read about them here.
  - Added support for the Universal Doom Map Format (UDMF): UDMF is a more flexible and powerful map format that allows for easier editing and more complex level designs.
    This long-awaited feature is a game-changer for mappers, opening up new possibilities for custom levels.
  - The implementation isn’t set in stone.
    We intend to make changes to it based on mappers’ feedback if necessary.
  - The UDMF map editor is not complete.
    Until it is complete, you can find the latest build pinned in #udmf on our Discord server.
  - You can convert your existing map to the new format, but older levels should continue to work as normal (let us know if they don’t!)
  - UDMF maps are allowed to be submitted to the OLDC!
  - Better rendering in large levels: Levels that used to break the renderer by the sheer size of their rooms should be far more visually stable now.
  - Improved Lua command/cvar safety and added basic rate limitation for Lua file access: Helps prevent addons from writing too much data to hard disk, among other things.
