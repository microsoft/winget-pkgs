ReleaseNotes: |-
  Another one just in time for Christmas! Will that become a thing? Let's see..
  New
  - New Batch Uninstall tool available! This allows you to uninstall multiple versions in one go and of course cleanup leftovers (i.e getting rid of these outdated folders in the vvvv installation directory) automagically. Find it in the Tools menu!
  Fixed
  - Generated bat files now have all their arguments one a single line. The previous formatting with one argument on distinct line seemed to cause issues, thanks to @TremensS, @lasalillo and Raphaël for reporting it!
  Thanks everyone for sharing your feature requests and bug reports here or in the forum, hope you'll enjoy this one!
