ReleaseNotes: |-
  A little hotfix: as reported by @tebjan and @chkw-rks, the launcher would complain about non-existing package repositories folders even though those were disabled. This release should fix that, thanks for the report!
  Fixed
  - The function that checks for non-existing package-repositories will now only look for those that are enabled
