ReleaseNotes: |-
  So here's one with just a bunch of bug fixes, but quite a lot of work under the hood for the release workflow. In a nutshell, everything is now automated to create a release, from compiling the launcher to building installers, creating zip archives, creating that GitHub release you're looking at and uploading artifacts to it. How cool is that? If you're curious, have a look at the /nuke folder!
  Fixed
  - Fixes GammaLauncher throwing an exception when uninstalling a vvvv (#97), thanks @chkw-rks for the report!
  - Fixes Log and Changelog windows not closing when closing the main window (#99), which was reported by @seltzdesign, thanks for that!
