ReleaseNotes: |-
  Hohoho!
  Quite a while since the last release! And this one is a hotfix, but with a tiny bit of new stuff still. Big thanks to all vvvv user who reported the Launcher was confused by of the new vvvv win-arm64 builds, and even more thanks to @bj-rn and @antongit for providing commits and useful information on how to deal with it :-) Let's see what's on the menu for this one.
  Fixed
  - Now deals correctly with win-x64 buillds. For now, the launcher only shows those, but should also let you download win-arm64 builds soon.. Thanks again @bj-rn and @antongit!
  - Should fix the annoying bug mentioned in #70 and #64 that when fetching new releases multiple times, new releases would be appended to the list rather than being added on top. Let's keep an eye on this one!
  Changes
  - Now uses the same color theme and style as ovvvvicial gamma extensions, for a more immersive experience
  - Uses ChildWindows so that you get cool scrollbar when the window is too small
  - Quick action buttons are now visible in all tabs
  Ok, cool! Thanks again to everyone for using the Launcher, let's hope I find some time in the next months for more life-changing updates :-)
