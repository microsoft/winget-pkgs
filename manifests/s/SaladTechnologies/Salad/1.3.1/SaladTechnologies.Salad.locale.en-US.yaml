ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Fixed a bug within Chopping Power that caused Salad to be unable to calculate if the node met the required minimal storage space.
  - Removed the option to disable the container environment setup prompts.
    As our network has matured, we’ve relied more and more on chef PC’s being container-ready to provide a good earning experience.
    This is now considered a core part of Salad and the vast majority of chefs have setup the container environment.
    Chefs will be prompted to set the container environment up if they have not.
  - Added better support resources in the container environment setup flow including a QR code that leads to the BIOS Virtualization Enabling guide for chefs who are struggling with this step.
  - Added an advanced option to allow Salad to use more RAM for container workloads.
    This can be found in the Workload Preferences settings and is available to machines which have at least 16 GB of RAM.
  - Made multiple updates and fixes to improve the reliability of container workloads.
