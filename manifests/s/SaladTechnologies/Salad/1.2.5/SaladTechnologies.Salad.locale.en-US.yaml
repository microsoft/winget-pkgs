ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Backend networking communications improved.
    This change will allow us to be more responsive and reactive towards network needs, which leads to better workloads for chefs.
  - Bug Fixes
  - Balance Notification Update.
    As of 1.2.5, chefs will only receive one balance threshold achievement notification.
    Previously, some chefs received multiple balance threshold notifications for the same balance achievement.
  - Fixed an issue that triggered the machine onboarding setup screens over and over again for some users who had already set their workload preferences.
