ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Introduced new preferences for workloads in the app settings.
    This will allow users to opt-in to optional workload types.
  - Updated the machine onboarding setup flow to ask chefs to make their choice regarding these optional workload types.
  - Note to chefs: The first new type of optional workload weâ€™re introducing are workloads that deal with Adult Content.
    To be absolutely clear, there are no such workloads live today, we wanted to introduce this setting ahead of time to allow you to make an informed choice.
    You can read more about these types of workloads in our support guide.
