ReleaseNotes: |-
  This release includes a data migration that will execute on first run. It will migrate all flat files in data directory to a single sqlite database. Depending on how much data you have and speed of computer this can take some time.
  If you have any issues with the migration the original data is not yet deleted and downgrading should work. But please open an issue so we can investigate and include sqlite in the issue title.
