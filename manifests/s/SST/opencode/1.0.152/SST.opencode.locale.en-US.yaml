ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Improved shell handling on Windows with better detection of Git Bash and support for the OPENCODE_GIT_BASH_PATH environment variable
  - Fixed app exit behavior so the app only exits when the prompt is empty; otherwise, the exit key will fall through to allow normal text input
  - Improved shell fallback compatibility by removing the -l flag when executing commands in unknown shells
  Thank you to 1 community contributor:

    - Shell: No -l in fallback, for max compatibility (#5452)
