  Session
  Session uses the Session encryption protocol and the Oxen blockchain’s decentralised Service Node network to provide anonymous, end-to-end encrypted messaging without relying on central servers.Release Overview
  - Disappearing Messages now has two modes, Disappear after Send and Disappear After Read #3016
  - When Disappear after Send is selected, messages will disappear from sender, recipient and network simultaneously a set time after they have been sent, regardless of whether the recipient has received or read the message.
  - When Disappear after Read is selected, messages will disappear for the sender and the sender’s swarm a set time after they have been sent, and for the recipient and the recipient’s swarm a set time after they have been read. Messages which haven’t been read	 after 14 days will disappear for the recipient and their swarm.
  - Both options will be available in 1-1 chats, but only Disappear after Send will be available in Groups. Neither will be available in Communities.
  - This release includes the new version of Disappearing Messages, however the feature won't be enabled until March 13th 10am AEDT, this will give users time to update their clients to be able to interpret the new type of messages
  - Moved the Message Info in the right panel #3021 #3024
