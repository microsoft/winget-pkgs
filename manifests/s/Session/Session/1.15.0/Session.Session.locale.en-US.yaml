  Release overview
  This update includes a major overhaul to group chats, making them more reliable and setting the stage for new features in the future. Group admins will need to recreate their group chats once the new Groups v2 architecture is enabled on 19th March at 22:00 UTC, and old groups will become read-only on 2nd April at 22:00 UTC.
