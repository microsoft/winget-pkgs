  Release notes
  hledger 1.50.3
  Fixes
  - hledger versions 1.50-1.50.2 ran much slower than normal (depending on the speed of your hard drive).
    This 1.50.3 release fixes that; so please upgrade, and avoid those older 1.50 releases.
    #2493
  - A regression in 1.50, where very large dates could produce wrong reports, has been fixed.
    (Affecting dates outside the range -25252734927764696-04-22..25252734927768413-06-12
    on 64 bit machines, or -5877752-05-08..5881469-05-27 on 32 bit machines.)
    #2479
  - If the LEDGER_FILE environment variable is set to a nonexistent file, we now report an error
    rather than silently falling back on a default file path, which was confusing.
    Also, we no longer support the legacy LEDGER environment variable as a fallback.
    #2485
  - setup now shows tidier output when a LEDGER_FILE or default file is not found,
  - add now checks balance assertions more robustly, with awareness of how everything is ordered in the journal.
    Also, it now allows adding balance assignments.
    #2478
  - check accounts no longer garbles non-ascii account names in its output.
    #2469
  - We now escape special characters properly when passing arguments to addons
    (with just one level of quoting/escaping, not two).
    And related docs have been improved.
    (Caleb Maclennan, Simon Michael, #2468)
  - Internal report code which could produce certain date-related errors has been made robust again.
    (Stephen Morgan)
  - The old "threaded" build flag, which cabal could turn off, has been dropped.
    This will hopefully prevent wrong builds like Debian's #1120833.
    #2495
  - Docs updated: add, areg, argument files, check, close, csv, depth, print, print, Special characters, Value reporting
  hledger-ui 1.50.3
  - --watch mode now also detects changes from apps which overwrite the file, such as VS Code.
    (Caleb Maclennan)
  - When hledger-ui is started with --pivot, re-enabling balance assertions
    with the I key now does a full journal reload, to check assertions more accurately.
    #2451
  - The old "threaded" build flag, which cabal could turn off, has been dropped.
    #2495
  - Allow brick 2.10, vty 6.5.
  - Uses hledger 1.50.3.
  hledger-web 1.50.3
  - The old "threaded" build flag, which cabal could turn off, has been dropped.
    #2495
  - Uses hledger 1.50.3

  Install
  For all install options, see hledger.org: Install.
  You can install hledger from most package managers (but check for a green badge indicating it's up to date).
  Or you can build it from source yourself.
  Or you can install up to date binaries from this page, by following the appropriate instructions below.
  If you find problems with these instructions, please let us know.
  All platforms
  If you have eget, that's a convenient way to download the right binaries for your machine:
  eget simonmichael/hledger --all
  Otherwise:
  GNU/Linux, 64-bit Intel
  At the command line:
  curl -fLOC- https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/releases/download/1.50.3/hledger-linux-x64.tar.gz | tar -xzv -f- -C/usr/local/bin hledger hledger-ui hledger-web
  hledger --version; hledger-ui --version; hledger-web --version    # should show 1.50.3
  Mac, 64-bit ARM or Intel
  In a terminal window (don't download the binaries with your web browser, they won't get authorised):
  On ARM macs:
  curl -fLOC- https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/releases/download/1.50.3/hledger-mac-arm64.tar.gz | tar -xzv -f- -C/usr/local/bin hledger hledger-ui hledger-web
  hledger --version; hledger-ui --version; hledger-web --version    # should show 1.50.3
  On Intel macs:
  curl -fLOC- https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/releases/download/1.50.3/hledger-mac-x64.tar.gz | tar -xzv -f- -C/usr/local/bin hledger hledger-ui hledger-web
  hledger --version; hledger-ui --version; hledger-web --version    # should show 1.50.3
  Windows, 64-bit ARM or Intel
  In a powershell window (press WINDOWS-R, powershell, ENTER):
  cd ~
  curl https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/releases/download/1.43.2/hledger-windows-x64.zip -OutFile hledger-windows-x64.zip
  Expand-Archive hledger-windows-x64.zip -Force -DestinationPath AppData\Roaming\local\bin
  hledger --version; hledger-ui --version; hledger-web --version    # should show 1.50.3
  Windows 7, 64-bit Intel
  These instructions have not been tested recently, please let us know if they work for you:
  - click hledger-windows-x64.zip below
  - choose Open with Windows Explorer, OK
  - click Extract all files
  - choose a destination folder - ideally one that appears in echo %PATH%, like C:\Windows (though that one will require administrator permission); otherwise, your home directory (C:\Users\YOURNAME)
  - check "Show extracted files when complete"
  - click Extract, wait for the destination folder to open
  - find the hledger, hledger-web icons (if you extracted to \Windows, you'll need to scroll down)
  - for each icon: double-click, uncheck "Always ask before opening this file", click Run
  - close those Explorer windows
  - open a command window (press Windows-r, type CMD, press enter)
  - hledger --version; hledger-ui --version; hledger-web --version should show 1.50.3
  - echo # >> .hledger.journal to ensure a default journal file exists. (Important: the doubled >> is needed to avoid overwriting existing data.)
  Problems:
  - Starting hledger by double-clicking its icon won't work because it needs arguments; run it from the command window instead.
  - Starting hledger-web by double-clicking its icon may fail eg because Explorer's command window is too small;
    configure that to be larger, or run hledger-web from a command window instead.
  - hledger or hledger-web may fail to run if there is not enough memory available.
  Next steps
  Once installed, run hledger, and perhaps read hledger.org: Quick start.
