ReleaseNotes: "Release notes\nhledger 1.34\nBreaking changes- check ordereddates no longer supports --date2. Also (not a breaking change): --date2 and secondary dates are now officially deprecated in hledger, though kept for compatibility.\nFeatures- You can now get a quick list of example command lines for hledger or its most useful subcommands by adding the --tldr flag (or just --tl).  For best appearance you should install the tldr client, though it's not required.These short \"tldr pages\" are a great counterbalance to verbose PTA docs. You can also use tldr without hledger to view the latest versions, or translations: tldr hledger[-COMMAND]. Or you can browse tldr pages online. Consider contributing translations! More tips at .\nImprovements- The hledger commands list has been reorganised, with commands listed roughly in the order you'll need them.\n- The general flags descriptions in --help have been updated and grouped.\n- Correctness checks now run in a documented order.  commodities are now checked before accounts, and tags before recentassertions. When both ordereddates and assertions checks are enabled, ordereddates now runs first, giving more useful error messages.\n- -I/--ignore-assertions is now overridden by -s/--strict (or check assertions), enabling more flexible workflows. Eg you can alias hl=\"hledger -I\" to delay balance assertions checking until you add -s to commands.\n- --color and --pretty now also accept y or n as argument.\n- When built with the ghcdebug flag and started with --debug=-1, hledger can be controlled by ghc-debug clients like ghc-debug-brick or a ghc-debug query script, for analysing memory/profile info.\nFixes- hledger COMMAND --man and hledger help TOPIC --man now properly scroll the man page to the TOPIC or COMMAND heading. The exact/prefix matching behaviour has been clarified in help --help.\n- In journal files, include directives with trailing whitespace are now parsed correctly.\n- The help command's help flags are now consistent with other commands (and it has --debug as a hidden flag).\n- Build errors with GHC 8.10 have been fixed. #2198\nDocs- The tables of contents on hledger.org pages now just list top-level headings, (and the hledger manual structure has been adjusted for this). This makes the hledger manual on hledger.org more scannable and less scary.\n- add: drop lengthy transcript, add simpler example commands (from tldr)\n- Amount formatting: move down, it's not the best first topic\n- balance: mention the --summary-only flag\n- check: expand check descriptions\n- examples: CSV rules: vanguard, fidelity, paypal updates\n- Generating data: rewrite\n- JSON output: link to OpenAPI spec\n- manuals: synopsis, options cleanup/consistency\n- Options: correction, NO_COLOR does not override --color\n- PART 4: COMMANDS: reorganise into groups, like the CLI commands list.\n- Period expressions: mention last day of month adjusting #2005\n- Secondary dates: expand, and declare them deprecated.\n- Time periods cleanup, simplify markup\n- Unicode characters: mention UTF-8 on windows\nScripts/addons- Added hledger-pricehist, an alias for the pricehist market price fetcher so that it can appear in hledger's commands list.\nhledger-ui 1.34\nFeatures- You can now get a quick list of example command lines by running with --tldr (or just --tl). For best appearance, install the tldr client, though it's not required.\nImprovements- The general flags in --help have been updated and grouped, consistent with hledger.\n- When built with the ghcdebug flag and started with --debug=-1, hledger-ui can be controlled by ghc-debug clients like ghc-debug-brick or a ghc-debug query script, for analysing memory/profile info.\nhledger-web 1.34\nFeatures- You can now get a quick list of example command lines by running with --tldr (or just --tl). For best appearance, install the tldr client, though it's not required.\nImprovements- The general flags in --help have been updated and grouped, consistent with hledger.\n- When built with the ghcdebug flag and started with --debug=-1, hledger-web can be controlled by ghc-debug clients like ghc-debug-brick or a ghc-debug query script, for analysing memory/profile info.\nDocs- A basic OpenAPI specification is provided for hledger-web's JSON-over-HTTP API. This is also applicable to hledger print's JSON output format.\nproject changes 1.34\nDocs- move release notes from the hledger_site repo to the main hledger repo\n- github release notes: show the release notes, hide the install instructions by default\n- github release notes: improve windows install commands\n- github release notes: start mentioning github usernames, enabling the Contributors avatar list\n- dev docs: new Developer FAQ, Contributor Quick Start updates\nScripts/addons- hledger-install.sh now uses stackage nightly, and a failure on non-Windows platforms has been fixed.\nInfrastructure/misc- A new release workflow creates github releases, uploads release binaries and generates release notes.\n- Github release binaries for mac and linux are now in .tar.gz format (no longer tarred and zipped).\n- There is a new oldest workflow for testing the oldest GHC we support (currently 8.10.7).\n- The binaries-mac-x64 workflow has been bumped from GHC 9.4 to 9.8.\n- The master branch's ci workflow has been updated to Ubuntu 24.04 and uses the preinstalled GHC & stack, saving some work.\n- md-issue-refs helps generate markdown issue links.\n- relnotes.hs helps generate release notes from changelogs.\n- The project Makefile has now been fully replaced by Justfile.\ncredits 1.34\nSimon Michael (@simonmichael)How to install\nThis release may arrive in your local packaging system soon - look for green badges at hledger.org: Install.\nOr you can build it from source, as described on that page.\nOr you can use the binaries below:GNU/Linux on 64-bit Intel\nAt the command line,\n\ncd /usr/local/bin\ncurl -LOC- \ntar xvf hledger-linux-x64.tar.gz && rm -f hledger-linux-x64.tar.gz\ncd\nhledger --version    # should show 1.34\n\nMac on 64-bit ARM or Intel\nIn a terminal window, run these commands to download, unpack, authorise, and install the binaries in your command line PATH.\nDon't use your web browser, it won't authorise the binaries.:\n\ncd /usr/local/bin\n\n# for ARM macs:\ncurl -LOC- \ntar xvf hledger-mac-arm64.tar.gz && rm -f hledger-mac-arm64.tar.gz\n\n# or for Intel macs:\ncurl -LOC- \ntar xvf hledger-mac-x64.tar.gz && rm -f hledger-mac-x64.tar.gz\n\ncd\nhledger --version    # should show 1.34\n\nWindows on 64-bit Intel or ARM\nIn a powershell window (press Windows-r, type powershell, press enter),- Make a place to keep hledger binaries, and add it to your PATH; this makes running hledger easier. You only need to do this once, not for every release:\n\n\nmkdir -force $HOME\\bin >$null\n$ENV:PATH += \";\"+$HOME+\"\\bin\"\n[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable(\"Path\", [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable(\"Path\", [EnvironmentVariableTarget]::User)+\";\"+$HOME+\"\\bin\", [EnvironmentVariableTarget]::User)\n\n- Download and install the release binaries:\n\n\ncd $HOME\\bin\ncp hledger.exe hledger.old.exe            # keep a backup of the old executables if you like\ncp hledger-ui.exe hledger-ui.old.exe\ncp hledger-web.exe hledger-web.old.exe\ncurl  -OutFile hledger-windows-x64.zip\nExpand-Archive hledger-windows-x64.zip -DestinationPath . -Force\ncd $HOME\nhledger --version      # should show 1.34\nhledger-ui --version\nhledger-web --version\n\n- Ensure a default journal file exists, and without a problematic encoding.\n(Not sure why \"ascii\" is needed here - hledger likes utf8 and understands utf8 BOM headers..\nbut the state of our unicode support on Windows\nis really unknown, your input welcome.)\n\n\nout-file -append -encoding ascii $HOME/.hledger.journal\n\nOnce that journal file exists, you can start hledger-web by double-clicking on the icon if you wish.Windows 7 on 64-bit Intel\n- click hledger-windows-x64.zip below\n- choose Open with Windows Explorer, OK\n- click Extract all files\n- choose a destination folder - ideally one that appears in echo %PATH%, like C:\\Windows (though that one will require administrator permission); otherwise, your home directory (C:\\Users\\YOURNAME)\n- check \"Show extracted files when complete\"\n- click Extract, wait for the destination folder to open\n- find the hledger, hledger-web icons (if you extracted to \\Windows, you'll need to scroll down)\n- for each icon: double-click, uncheck \"Always ask before opening this file\", click Run\n- close those Explorer windows\n- open a command window (press Windows-r, type CMD, press enter)\n- hledger --version should show the new version\n- echo # >> .hledger.journal to ensure a default journal file exists. (Important: the doubled >> is needed to avoid overwriting existing data.)\nProblems:- Starting hledger by double-clicking its icon won't work because it needs arguments; run it from the command window instead.\n- Starting hledger-web by double-clicking its icon may fail eg because Explorer's command window is too small;\nconfigure that to be larger, or run hledger-web from a command window instead.\n- hledger or hledger-web may fail to run if there is not enough memory available.\n\nOnce installed, run hledger, and perhaps read hledger.org: Quick start."
