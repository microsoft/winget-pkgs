  Release notes
  Better transaction balancing, include improvements, auto posting account interpolation, csv data commands, import archiving, timeclock improvements, fixes
  hledger 1.50
  Breaking changes
  - Transaction balancing is now done in a more robust way, using local precisions only (like Ledger) #2402.
    Until now, a transaction was required to balance using its commodities's global display precisions.
    Small imbalances were tolerated by configuring display precisions for the whole journal (with commodity directives).
    Now, a transaction is required to balance using the precisions in its journal entry only.
    This means each entry can use the precision it needs, and balancing precision and display precision are independent.
    (So eg, increasing the display precision with -c no longer breaks the journal.)
    In practice this requires journal entries to be more accurate, and you will probably need to fix some old entries.
    There are three main ways to fix an entry:
    - reduce the amounts' precision (use fewer decimal digits, so a lower balancing precision is inferred)
    - make the amounts more accurate (use better decimal digits, so the amounts sum to zero more closely)
    - or (easiest) add an amountless "expenses:rounding" posting (this is not a cheat, it's a more accurate record of what your bank/broker is doing).
    You can also keep the old transaction-balancing behaviour with --txn-balancing=old, for now.
    But updating your entries is recommended.
    The old behaviour could allow small remainders to accumulate over time,
    in accounts that often have an inexact posting amount or cost amount and are never reconciled -
    typically equity, revenues, and expenses.
    You can check for this in your old journals with a command like
    hledger bal cur:\\$ -c '$1.000000000000' | grep -E '\...0*[1-9]'
    (show $ account balances, with many decimals, which have a non-zero decimal in the 3rd place or beyond)
  - Timeclock format has had various changes:
    - Timeclock syntax and parsing is now more robust (when not using --old-timeclock):
      - Semicolon always starts a comment (and timeclock account names may not include semicolons).
      - Trailing spaces are ignored.
      - Clock-ins now require an account name.
      - Clock-outs now can have a comment and tags.
      - Timeclock entries are processed in parse order.
    - Some order-related bugs in 1.43 have been fixed.
    - Concurrent/overlapping sessions are now fully supported, even if they have the same account name.
    - The timeclock doc has been rewritten.
    - The --old-timeclock hidden flag has been renamed, documented, and now also affects included files.
      #2141, #2365, #2400, #2417
  - Some edge cases in balance report behaviour were changed for internal consistency:
    - --declared now treats parent accounts consistently.
    - --flat --empty now ensures that implied accounts with no postings are not displayed,
      but accounts with zero balance and actual postings are.
      (Stephen Morgan, #2360, #2395)
  - hledger now requires at least GHC 9.6 (and base 4.18), to ease maintenance.
  Fixes
  - Paging long output no longer gives an error when LESS is undefined and
    less does not have mouse support (as on some FreeBSD systems).
  - The all: query now requires at least one posting to match.
    (Previously, matching no postings at all was also considered a success.)
  - When using journal format's include directive, several kinds of
    error (read failure, cyclic include..) could show an off-by-one line
    number or excerpt, confusingly. This has been fixed.
    Also, attempting to include a rules file now gives a better error message.
  - In CSV if rules, match group references like \1 no longer get confused
    by differing case.
    (Jay Neubrand, #2419)
  - add, commodities, and diff now support the --conf and -n/--no-conf flags,
    like other commands.
    #2446
  - On Windows machines, the add command now properly shows green prompts instead of ANSI codes.
    #2410
  - Balance reports now properly show the historical balance even when the report period is empty.
    #2403
  - Balance reports' csv output, and the balance --budget report, now respect the --summary-only flag.
    (Stephen Morgan, #2411, #2443)
  - The demo command no longer mentions -- ASCIINEMAOPTS in help (that longer works).
    Also it shows a better error message when asciinema is not installed.
  - hledger help -m TOPIC or hledger help -i TOPIC now show the help for TOPIC, as intended.
    #2399
  - Since hledger 1.32.1, the import command, when importing multiple files at once,
    would write an empty .latest file for data files with no new transactions
    (causing all transactions in those data files to appear new on next import).
    This is now fixed.
    #2444
  Features
  - CSV rules files can now run a shell command to clean the data:
    # read the latest foo*.csv file, and replace "USD" with "$"
    source foo*.csv | sed -e 's/USD/$/g'
    or to generate the data:
    # fetch JSON from simplefin.org, then transform it to CSV
    source | simplefinjson | simplefincsv
    Whenever hledger runs one of these commands, it will echo the command on stderr.
  - The import command can now automatically archive imported CSV data files,
    saving a dated copy in a data/ directory. This can be useful for troubleshooting,
    or for regenerating entries later with improved rules.
    To enable it, add archive to the rules file.
    This and the previous feature can simplify file management and reduce the need for support scripts.
  Improvements
  - In command line help, flag group headings have been simplified.
    And the help for -f/--file, add, and import is now clearer.
  - When given both an unknown command and an unknown flag, hledger now gives
    a clearer error message (about the command, not the flag).
    #2388
  - A long standing awkwardness with addon commands has been solved:
    you can now use addon options freely in a hledger command line;
    you don't need to write a -- argument first.
    #458
  - In smart dates and period expressions, quarter syntax like 2025q1 or Q2 is now fully supported.
  - In end-value reports where the end date is unspecified, market prices
    in the future can no longer influence the report end date and valuation date.
    (Market prices on or before today, still can.)
    #2445
  - A tag: query with the accounts command now only matches account tags, not posting tags.
    Eg, hledger accounts tag:t now lists only account a from this journal:
    account a  ; t:
    2025-01-01
        a          1
        b         -1  ; t:
  - Journal format's include directive now has more robust and convenient glob patterns:
    - ** can match both directories and filenames
    - ** now automatically ignores anything under dotted directories, like .git/, foo/.secret/, etc.
      (If you do want it to search dotted directories,
      you can use the --old-glob flag for now to restore the old behaviour. See also Glob#49.)
    - Glob patterns with wildcards now automatically exclude the current file.
      Eg include **.journal will include all other .journal files in this directory and below.
  - include's error messages and debug messages have been improved.
    Eg, the including file paths are also shown.
  - Journal format's auto posting rules can now use %account to insert the account name
    from the matched posting.
    (Stephen Morgan, #1975, #2412)
  - The aregister command no longer abbreviates account names
    when producing csv, html, or fods output.
    (savanto, #1995, #2416)
  - The commodities, payees and tags commands now have --used/--declared/--undeclared/--unused flags, like accounts.
    And there has been a general cleanup of options and help across these four commands.
  - The import command now shows info messages on stderr, not stdout.
    Its "no new transactions" output is more compact, showing file names not file paths.
    And it no longer prints an extra newline.
  - The setup command's output has been improved.
    Lack of a pager is now reported as info, not warning (there's no default pager on Windows).
    Shell completions are ignored for now.
