Description: Oxygen XML Author redefines structured content authoring with innovative features and a user-friendly interface, making XML technologies easily accessible to everyone. Users can benefit from standard frameworks (e.g. DITA and DocBook), publishing formats, review tools, and unparalleled extensibility. The authoring experience can be amplified by using the Oxygen AI Positron Assistant plugin to add AI tools for content creation, readability improvement, and flexible content restructuring.
