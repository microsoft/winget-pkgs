ReleaseNotes: |-
  Oxygen XML Web Author version 27.1.0 is an incremental release of the innovative web-based XML authoring tool.
  This version introduces a new Differences view in the File Comparison tool, helping users to quickly understand changes in review comments. Also, version 4.1 of the Oxygen AI Positron Assistant is supported, enabling users to fix validation problems using AI. In addition, users can now attach files from their computers directly into AI prompts for more context-rich interactions.

  Compare/Merge
  New Differences View Helps Understand Review Comments
  A new Differences view was added in the File Comparison tool. Its main purpose is to help you understand differences in review comments.
  For example, when comparing a document that went through a review process with its original version, this view presents the newly added comments and replies.

  Ignore Whitespaces in Text-based Comparisons
  When using the File Comparison tool to show text-based differences, the toolbar contains a Toggle Ignore Whitespaces button that enables or disables the whitespace ignoring feature. Ignoring whitespaces means that the application will not report differences on zones where there is only a difference in whitespaces (e.g. indentation). This is useful when trying to focus on the actual differences for documents that have differing indentation, formatting, etc.

  General Editing/Reviewing
  Reload Current DITA Map
  You can reload a map in the DITA Map side-pane (while preserving the expand/collapse state of the tree) to see the latest changes in the map structure and titles.

  Expand All DITA Map Nodes
  You can expand all DITA map nodes using the Expand All action from the contextual menu of the DITA Map side-pane or of the specialized DITA map tree editing mode.
  Enhanced Dark Mode Compatibility in Chrome
  Improvements were made to support Google Chrome's experimental Auto Dark Mode for Web Contents feature.

  AI Assistant
  Oxygen XML Web Author 27.1.0 supports version 4.1 of the Oxygen AI Positron Assistant, including the following new features:
  Fix Validation Problems
  The new Fix Validation Problems AI action validates the current document and suggests fixes for all identified issues, streamlining both the validation process and the resolution of validation problems, ensuring high-quality content.

  Attach Local Files
  In addition to the support to attach a remote file, a new Attach from computer option allows you to incorporate files from your local machine into prompts. For example, you can attach a screenshot and ask the AI to generate a documentation section based on that image.
  AI-based MathML Generation
  The new Formula/Equation action (located in the Content Generation category) leverages AI to generate MathML formulas based on your descriptions. This feature simplifies the creation of complex mathematical formulas.
  New AI Function
  When processing or generating content, a custom AI action can now use the new callback function, validate_document_content, that validates a document, ensuring that the generated content is valid. In case of errors, it offers the opportunity to automatically correct the detected problems.
  Notification for Unchanged Content
  When an AI action processes content but does not result in any changes, you are now informed, eliminating the need for unnecessary previews or visual inspection. This improvement saves time and ensures a smoother workflow.

  Git Integrations
  Commits Without Changes are Prevented
  When a user tries to make a commit to the Git repository but there are no changes, the commit will not proceed.
  Duplicate Names Prevented When Creating Branches
  To increase compatibility with Windows systems, Web Author prevents you from creating a branch with the same name as an existing one but with different letter case.

  Authentication
  Improved Floating Licenses Allocation when Authentication is Enabled
  If authentication is enabled, floating licenses are now assigned to a specific user instead of a browser session. This means a user will use only one license, even if they are working with multiple browsers. The user's details can be seen in the License Server when viewing the currently allocated floating licenses.

  Customization and Integration
  Encrypt Confidential Values in Options File
  Users who configure custom settings in the options.xml file now have the ability to encrypt option values that are confidential (e.g. passwords). A new API method (ro.sync.exml.options.Options.setEncryptedStringProperty) was added for setting encrypted values and another one (ro.sync.exml.options.Options.getEncryptedStringProperty) to retrieve encrypted values.
  Authentication Provider in REST Plugin
  The REST connector can now be configured as an authentication provider to block any request to Web Author if the user is not logged in.

  Component Updates
  Apache Tomcat 9.0.102
  Updated the Apache Tomcat server to version 9.0.102.
