ShortDescription: Advanced Registry Editor
Description: RegAlyzer is a tool to browse and change the registry. It was created because of a few features we missed in the original regedit tool, from support for exotic value types over background and regular expression search to better bookmarks, displaying .reg files in the accustomed style and a history view. RegAlyzer 2, currently available as a release candidate, will support a multi-tabbed interface, value interpretations, constant names for values, and snapshots of hives to track changes.
