ReleaseNotes: |-
  New
  Blame Window: Added the ability to copy the commit hash and commit message directly from the commit details popup.
  Improved
  Portable Git: Updated to version 2.47.2, enhancing compatibility and performance. Working Copy: The selection behavior in the Working Copy file list improved. Rows can now be selected by clicking anywhere within them, not just on filename controls.
  Fixed
  Preferences View: Adjusted the preferences view to fit properly on screens with large scaling settings. The main view is now placed within a scrollable container for better accessibility. Stacked Branches: Resolved an issue where newly created and checked-out stacked branches did not display proper nesting in the branch structure until the view was refreshed. Branches now appear correctly nested immediately upon creation. History View: Fixed incorrect graph line rendering when starting the application and restoring a session with the History view. Graph lines now render correctly without requiring a view switch. History View: Corrected the help button on a GPG popup that previously opened an invalid web page. The button now directs to the correct help page. Git Certificates: Improved the detection of the ca-bundle.crt certificate file in Git binaries. Diff View: Resolved encoding issues that prevented proper functionality. UI: Fixed an issue where changes to the Windows accent color were not immediately reflected in Tower if the theme remained unchanged. The application now monitors an additional registry entry to ensure real-time updates. Working Tree View: Resloved an issue where affected files were not displayed after editing a commit. Affected files now appear correctly. Working Tree View: Resolved an issue where the warning for large diff sets was not displayed, leaving the details view blank. The warning now appears as expected. Update Notification: Fixed an issue where the update banner did not disappear after clicking "Remind me later." The banner now hides as expected. Blame Window: Corrected the alignment of the "blame details" popup, which was previously vertically misplaced. The popup is now properly aligned. Service Account: Fixed an issue where the 'Set' and 'Clear' buttons for the "Private SSH key" setting were not visible when using longer key names. The buttons now display correctly regardless of key length.
