  Fixed
  Crash: Fixed a crash during Stage All operations in large repositories. Crash: Fixed a crash during startup fetch operations. Crash: Fixed a crash when refreshing Bitbucket Server pull requests. Crash: Fixed a crash when checking out remote branches via sidebar double-click. UI: Fixed vertically misaligned labels in segmented buttons.
