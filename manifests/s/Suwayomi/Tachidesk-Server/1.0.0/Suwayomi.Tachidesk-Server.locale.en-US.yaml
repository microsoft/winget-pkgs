ReleaseNotes: |-
  Server: v1.0.0 + WebUI: r1409
  We've done a lot since our last release over a year ago. Checkout the CHANGELOG.md for the full list of changes.
  GraphQL API
  We have redone our whole API in GraphQL. We are excited to get this out there so more Suwayomi clients like JUI and Sorayomi can use it! GraphQL is a great technology and provides much more flexibility then our previous REST API.
  Rename to Suwayomi
  We've had the rename in the works for a while, we wanted to have a better branding. Tachidesk doesn't actually make sense, its a mix of 2 languages, and Tachi means standing. We ended up deciding on Suwayomi, which is a shorthand for Suwariyomi(sitting reading).
  New Launcher for Suwayomi
  We needed a better experience when launching the application, a launcher was a great idea. We've got all the settings available in the launcher so you can configure everything you need before launching!
