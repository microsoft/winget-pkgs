ReleaseNotes: |-
  General
  Most of my time this year has been working on Suwayomi-Server, we have massively improved it and I am excited to implement everything into JUI!
  Sadly due to this, JUI did not get much love, I hope to work on JUI and get it up to par soon though!
  Server settings!
  I whipped this up in the last few days to finally get a release out, we now have runtime server settings! This will allow you to configure your server when its running. I was able to add all the new settings as well! This was majorly needed due to the extension repo requirements, you can now add them in JUI under Settings -> Server!
  I did end up removing a lot of server-startup settings, if you see anything you configured reset, you can just toggle it with the new setting location.
  Rename to Suwayomi-JUI
  We are now changing from the Tachidesk naming to Suwayomi, see reasoning here. JUI is now following the new naming scheme.
  Mac M1 build
  JUI now includes a Mac M1 build! This is thanks to Github actions finally adding M1 runners, allowing us to create builds on them!
  Update to Suwayomi-Server v1.0.0
  Suwayomi-Server has gotten a lot of new stuff lately, I hope to use it all in JUI eventually! The internal server has been updated so you can still get a lot of new features and fixes from just updating JUI!
  Bugfixes
  - Fix reader memory leak, will also reduce CPU usage in the reader
  - Fix backup export
  - Fix library update subscription with Suwayomi-Server v1.0.0
  - Probably more then I can think of now
