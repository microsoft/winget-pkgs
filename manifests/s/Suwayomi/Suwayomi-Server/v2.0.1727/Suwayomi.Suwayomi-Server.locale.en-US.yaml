ReleaseNotes: |-
  Caution
  If you previously used the MSI Installer, uninstall all Suwayomi-Server versions you have installed before installing the latest release! All your data will be untouched.
  Update to Java 21
  This has been a long time coming! This release we focused on getting the server more stable and improving performance. With this we decided to finally move past Java 8 and into the future! We will continue updating to the latest Java LTS release from here on out. Make sure to update your runtimes!
  Add OPDS API
  We have added API endpoints for OPDS and OPDS-PSE! With this your favourite mobile book readers will be able to download and read manga directly from your server! A little tip, it works best if you pre-download the chapters on Suwayomi-Server!
  More Tracking!
  We have added support for the Bangumi and Kitsu Trackers. We hope you enjoy them, there is more to come later!
  Changing Version Scheme
  We have decided to move to a major.minor.revision versioning scheme to improve compatibility on a few platforms between Stable and Preview. This shouldn't have any impact on how you use the app though, you will receive update notifications based on if you have preview or stable installed!
  More Changes!
  - Fix MSI Installer
  - Optimized Backup Import
  - Improve JS Support
  - Optimize included JRE
  - And many more fixes and features
