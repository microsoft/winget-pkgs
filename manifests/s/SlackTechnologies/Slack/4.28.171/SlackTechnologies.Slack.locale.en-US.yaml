  What's New
  • On Sept. 1, we’ll be deprecating support for some older operating systems and outdated versions of Slack. Please visit our Help Center to get all the details: https://slack.com/help/articles/115002037526-System-requirements-for-using-Slack
  
  Bug Fixes
  • Trying to capture your screen with a third-party app while also sharing your screen in Slack may have resulted in the non-Slack app crashing. We’d like to say that this was because the idea of “capture” is antithetical to “sharing,” but in truth it was just a “bug.”
  • Sharing your screen and then right-clicking the Slack icon in the taskbar made you the winner of a secret game. The prize was that the app would crash. Nobody liked that.
  • If you’re someone who uses a symlink for your %appdata% folder and noticed that Slack was crashing on startup, we have some good news: Slack won’t be crashing anymore. If you don’t use symlinks, well, this note doesn’t apply to you, but we appreciate you reading anyway.
  • Dragging the Slack window between multiple displays was resulting in some spooky behavior, like the window snapping to locations where you distinctly did not drop it. “Haunted Slack” launches in 2025, but until then we must insist all ghosts be unambiguously busted.

  Security Guidance
  • This release includes minor security improvements. Updating is beneficial.
