Description: |-
  Network Time Server is part of the Network Time System package used for setting up and running a dedicated time server on the company network. The application is capable of time synchronization with external NTP/SNTP sources - public NTP time servers or local trusted time sources such as NMEA 0183 GPS receivers (via COM, USB, Bluetooth ports, TCP/IP, UDP multicasting), radio clock cards, NTP servers etc. Moreover, it can host the time received from an external time source for Windows workstations, any NTP/SNTP compatible devices and non-Windows NTP clients.

  Key Features:
  - This allows you to synchronize time on various hardware such as routers, switches, IP cameras and computers running operating systems different from Windows.
  - NTSv2, our proprietary time sync protocol, comes with the following enhanced functionality: 256-bit AES encryption, Network-wide licensing management, Time client settings distribution, UDP broadcasting support
  - The time Network Time Server receives from an external time source can be customized in a few ways, including converting to the local time and applying a custom offset.
  - Configuring several external time sources such as NTP, SNTP servers or NMEA 0183 GPS receiver helps you ensure a dependable system of precise time.
  - All major events relating to both the internal time server and external time sources are logged to the Application Event Log and separate text files.
