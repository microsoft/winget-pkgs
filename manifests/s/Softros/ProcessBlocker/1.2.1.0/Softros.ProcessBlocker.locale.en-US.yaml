Description: |-
  Process Blocker’s structure provides a great flexibility, allowing you to block applications by wildcard, filter them by username or group, create a whitelist and detect files by CRC. The CRC algorithm is extremely fast as the checksum is not calculated for the whole file. Test results for about 3,000 executables show that a false positive can occur only if a file was patched after compilation (for example, by a virus). This, in its turn, emphasizes the fact that our product is not designed to be anti-malware software.

  Warning: Always exert caution when using Process Blocker and especially wildcards. Any incorrect use may lead to important Windows executables getting blocked and, as a result, cause an operating system malfunction.

  Before purchasing Process Blocker, you can try it free for 10 days with no limitations or restrictions.
