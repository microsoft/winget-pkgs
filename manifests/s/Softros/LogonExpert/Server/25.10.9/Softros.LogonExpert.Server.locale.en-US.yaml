Description: |-
  LogonExpert Server is a centralized solution for storing and managing Windows autologon credentials, settings, scheduled tasks, and licenses for all LogonExpert Clients in your network. Integrated with Active Directory, it lets you browse the domain tree (including multiple trusted domains), select individual computers or groups, apply settings and credential templates, and deploy them to endpoints running LogonExpert.

  LogonExpert Clients automatically discover the fastest available server via domain DNS, establish a TLS-encrypted, Kerberos/NTLM-authenticated connection, and retrieve updates on a schedule or before each autologon. Multi-server deployment with real-time replication and load balancing ensures high availability and fast response.

  Need to rotate passwords? Update them once in LogonExpert Server Manager to synchronize changes to Active Directory and the server database; clients receive the new credentials at the next check-in.

  Key Features:
  - Configure, store, and update LogonExpert Client autologon credentials, settings, and licenses from a single console on a dedicated or distributed server infrastructure.
  - Update user passwords simultaneously in the LogonExpert Server database and in Active Directory.
  - All client–server traffic is protected with TLS encryption. Domain-level Kerberos or NTLM authentication is used between the client computer and the server. LogonExpert Server's database is encrypted with AES-256 using a hardware-dependent key.
  - Configure user credentials, settings, and assign licenses for individual LogonExpert Client machines or groups of computers in bulk via the LogonExpert Server Manager.
  - Supports a multi-server architecture with real-time database replication between LogonExpert Server instances and provides a load-balancing mechanism that allows LogonExpert Clients to retrieve and update their settings and user credentials faster and more reliably.
  - Authorized LogonExpert Servers are registered in your domain’s DNS server (via SRV records), allowing LogonExpert Clients (and other servers) to automatically discover and connect to them.

  Completely free for up to 20 endpoints, Free trial for 15 days for more endpoints
