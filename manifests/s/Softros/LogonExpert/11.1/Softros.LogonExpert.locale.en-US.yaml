Description: |-
  LogonExpert is a secure approach to automatic logon. It stores logon data encrypted with the AES 256 algorithm. It directly interacts with WinLogon (the part of the operating system responsible for logon) to ensure that no other application can intercept logon data. It has many other useful features.

  - LogonExpert is easy to configure, stable and reliable.
  - The AES 256 encryption algorithm protects your logon data; direct interaction with WinLogon secures your computer while it’s logging in.
  - As an alternative to the Windows built-in locking mechanism, you can lock the user's desktop transparently, keeping its content visible for everyone but protected from unwanted human access via mouse or keyboard.
  - Configure a simple pre-logon delay, or set up an advanced configuration with the built-in scheduler. Also available is the post-logon wake-up capability.
  - LogonExpert works with all types of Windows accounts including local or Active Directory domain accounts, Microsoft (formerly Windows Live) and Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) accounts. Moreover, both password and PIN based types of authentication are supported.
  - LogonExpert can be configured to automatically log a specified user back on each time any user of the computer logs off.
  - Ctrl+Alt+Del requests, shutdown events, system legal notices and any other windows appearing before logon are bypassed automatically.
  - LogonExpert works with Micro Focus OES eDirectory (formerly Novell Netware) and can additionally autologon its users keeping their credentials just as secure.
  - Add and log on any number of users to one computer simultaneously using the application’s interface, command line, scripts or scheduling tools.
  - LogonExpert detects and works with all major two-factor authentication (2FA) and multi-factor authentication (MFA) systems for Windows autologon, such as Duo, Imprivata, Okta, etc. You get the software's secure autologon functionality while also having your system protected by 2FA/MFA.
