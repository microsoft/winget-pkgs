  1.1301.0 (2025-11-12)
  The Snyk CLI is being deployed to different deployment channels, users can select the stability level according to their needs. For details please see this documentation
  Features
  - container: The Snyk CLI now supports scanning Ubuntu Chisel images for vulnerabilities (9328757)
  - container: The Snyk CLI now supports scanning container images with zstd-compressed layers (5080e42)
  - container: Added a new parameter, --include-system-jars, to support scanning of usr/lib JARs (57078b6)
  - test(maven): Initial maven 4 support, testing against the most recent release candidate (88cf47e)
  - test(maven): A new experimental flag --include-provenance that will produce DepGraphs containing purls with checksum qualifiers for each package. Primarily to be used via --print-graph, not yet used in the main testing flow (5b8fe0a)
  - sbom(maven): A new experimental flag --include-provenance that will produce an SBOM with checksum qualifiers in each purl (5b8fe0a)
  - language-server: A new feature flag service to manage feature flags on a per-organization basis. This allows for more granular control over feature rollouts and enables fetching feature flags directly from the folder configuration. (2cc554e)
  Bug Fixes
  - general: Fix incorrect error mapping for varying status codes (5829500)
  - general: Some invalid flag combinations are now correctly handled (ca5903b)
  - test: The Snyk CLI now correctly handles optional dependencies without separate package entries
    (bfcbda7)
  - test: The Snyk CLI now correctly handles aliased packages with nested dependencies (bfcbda7)
  - test: The Snyk CLI now correctly handles bundled dependencies with non-hoisted bundle owners (bfcbda7)
  - test: Fixes issue where sub packages were getting grouped incorrectly, leading to deps getting marked as missing. (b904e8c)
  - test, sbom: Stops misclassifying NX Build project.json as a NuGet project (ff6860f)
  - test(npm): Improve npm alias support (cb37da7)
  - test(npm): The Snyk CLI now correctly handles npm packages with bundled dependencies (7d93b86)
  - test(python): Scanning projects using Python 2.7 will no longer fail with a string formatting error (4effc7f)
  - test(python): Fixed JSON parsing error for Python projects with missing packages (4effc7f)
  - test(maven): Underlying maven commands adjusted slightly to make aggregate projects that encounter issues when rebuilding more likely to succeed (3b72d86)
  - test(dotnet): Fix an issue with NuGet v3 scanner where the netstandard and netcoreapp TargetFrameworks were treated as .netx.x (227b50c)
  - test(dotnet): Fix an issue with NuGet v3 scanner where the pinned dependencies were not discovered (0d9b0c4)
  - container: Fixed a bug where scanning docker images with very large files would result in the CLI crashing with no message (57078b6)
  - container: Fix rare crash when scanning large Docker images (195ed78)
  - container: Fix issue where go binaries in Linux images with complex paths were not properly detected as go binaries when scanning on Windows (be8098b)
  - code: Add missing explicit error handling (755d01f)
  - unmanaged: Ignored vulnerabilities in unmanaged (C/C++) projects are now properly excluded from JSON output when using .snyk policy files. This ensures that snyk-to-html and other tools that consume JSON output will correctly respect vulnerability ignores. (fa808c1)
  - dependencies: Fix CVE-2025-58058 and CVE-2025-11065 (d7e87e2)
  - dependencies: Upgrade golang to 1.24.10 to fix vulnerabilities (c039f99)
