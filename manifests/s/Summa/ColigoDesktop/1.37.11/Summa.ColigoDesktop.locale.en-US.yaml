ShortDescription: Coligo DESKTOP is the application where the various communication channels come together. You can call, chat, share files, and invite colleagues to collaborate.
Description: |-
  Increasing efficiency in the workplace goes beyond the boundaries of UC. The integration of instant messaging, voice, video and conferencing is crucial to this. Team Collaboration is taken to a new level by logging conversations and all exchanged data. Discussions are extended beyond the boundaries of meetings. The popularity of collaboration software with additional web communication functions shows that the currently available communication solutions do not meet the requirements.
  Coligo DESKTOP meets these requirements - a client solution that combines team collaboration functions with web communication (voice/video group calls).
