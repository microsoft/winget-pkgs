  Notable Changes
  - Windows: Significantly improved Explorer context menu extension, including re-adding main menu/submenu configuration where possible, support for processes running as Administrator, and limited ARM64 support.
  - Linux: Fixed text editor width calculations for monospace fonts.
  - Other minor fixes and enhancements.
  Appearance
  - Windows: Fixed checkbox lists' dotted level lines showing as black-on-black in dark mode.
  Folder Compare
  - macOS: Fixed status bar showing free disk space as 0 bytes on Intel CPUs.
  - Fixed path edit incorrectly showing both the error message and path smushed together after a load error.
  Installer
  - Windows: Fixed hang when trying to install the Windows 11 Explorer context menu if calling PowerShell generates unexpected output.
  - Windows: Install/uninstall log now includes details of the shell extension install.
  - Windows: Removed "Delete all Beyond Compare 5 settings" checkbox in the uninstaller's confirmation dialog when doing an "All Users" uninstall.
  - Windows: Fixed uninstaller not closing BCClipboard automatically.
  - Windows: Made shell extension upgrade process for non-admin installs more robust.
  - Windows: Updated Inno Setup to 6.3.3.
  Misc
  - Linux: Fixed "File Formats" dialog not remembering the checkbox state for enabled file formats.
  Table Compare
  - Fixed auto-sized widths for ignored unimportant columns.
  - Fixed copy to clipboard handling of cells containing line endings or a delimiter.
  Text Views
  - Linux: Fixed width calculations for monospace fonts.
  Windows Explorer Context Menu Extension
  - Re-added ability to configure menu items to appear directly on the top level menu or in a "Beyond Compare" submenu when shown on the Windows 10, in Windows 11's "Show More Options" menu, and in third-party applications.
  - Fixed extension not appearing in "Run As Administrator" processes on Windows 11 (e.g., Total Commander).
  - Fixed extension not showing in Windows 11 for ARM64 "Show More Options" menu. Supporting the top-level menu is still a goal, but we're waiting on Delphi's ARM64 compiler.
  - Fixed installing shell extension on Windows 11 21H1 and 21H2. Upgrades from 5.0.2 or earlier will need to turn on the extension in the Options dialog or manually uninstall/reinstall to enable it.
  - Fixed "Compare to ..." caption incorrectly showing the entire path for files/folders on portable media devices (MTP).
  - Fixed comparing files on portable devices (MTP) when Explorer's "Show > File name extensions" option is turned off.
  - Fixed menu items not appearing in Libraries virtual folders in cases where BC4 did.
  - Fixed menu items incorrectly appearing on unsupported virtual folders (e.g., "Libraries") and then trying to open BC with an invalid path.
  - Fixed duplicate menu items when showing context menu for network servers/shares in Explorer's navigation treeview.
  - Fixed using "Select Left" on a drive root showing the second menu as 'Compare to ""'.
  - Fixed using "Select Left" on a file and then selecting a drive root that contains a matching filename showing the second menu as 'Compare to \file.ext' instead of 'Compare to C:\file.ext'.
  - Fixed ability for a non-admin user to toggle off and on the Win11 context menu after installing for all users.
  - Fixed icons appearing with a solid black background when running in an ARM64 process or when selecting files on portable media devices.
  - Recreated Select Left/Center arrow icons to be more in line with the v4 appearance.
