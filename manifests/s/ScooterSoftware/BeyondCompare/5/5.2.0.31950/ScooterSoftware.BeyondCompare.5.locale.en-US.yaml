ReleaseNotes: |-
  Notable Changes
  - Added support for comparing and filtering Unix owner/group/file type and additional Windows file attributes (e.g., symbolic link, offline).
  - Expanded support for disabling features via admin policies.
  - Changed how saved passwords are stored. Exported profiles are compatible with previous versions, but downgrading an install will treat the passwords as blank.
  - Table Compare now ignores case and whitespace when aligning columns by name.
  - Fixed "Invalid key material type" error when connecting to Dropbox.
  - Linux: Updated to Qt 6.
  - Linux: Updated .deb packages for Deb822.
  - Various other enhancements and stability improvements.
  Admin Policies
  - Expanded support for disabling features via admin policies.
    - Policies are stored in the registry under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE on Windows and as /etc/bcompare.conf on macOS and Linux. See help for details.
    - Added DisableSavedPasswords policy to hide "Save Password" checkboxes.
    - Added DisableRemoteProfiles policy to disable FTP and cloud profiles. Read-only Subversion access is still enabled.
    - macOS/Linux: Added support for DisableCheckForUpdates policy.
    - Windows: Added /DisableCheckForUpdates, /DisableRemoteProfiles, and /DisableSavedPasswords switches to installer to enable their respective admin policies. /DisableCheckForUpdates is an alias to the existing /DisableUpdates one.
  Appearance
  - Windows: Font sizes no longer change slightly when moving between monitors with different scale factors.
  - Windows: Fixed file view "Align with..." mode labels for "Line # is marked" and "Select line(s) to align" drawing as black on black in dark mode.
  - Windows: Fixed visibility of I-beam with hourglass mouse cursor in dark mode.
  - Windows: Fixed detached merge output panel showing incorrectly sized images if it's on a monitor with different scaling than the main view.
  - Linux: Mouse cursor for Picture Compare + and text editor I-beam when busy now use system-provided images to work around issues with Wayland fraction scaling.
  - Linux: Fixed buttons with icons (e.g., Session > Save Session As > New Subfolder) showing black text on a black background in dark mode.
  - macOS: "File Formats" dialog now shows red for file formats that won't be used because a higher format matches the same file masks.
  - macOS: Fixed various buttons drawing the button shape smaller when they have focus (e.g., + and - buttons next to Home view search edit).
  - macOS: Fixed file view comparison results icon in status bar drawing upside down.
  Folder Compare
  - Windows: Added support for displaying, comparing, and filtering additional Windows file attributes (e.g., temporary, offline).
  - Added support for filtering symbolic links and other Unix special file types (e.g., FIFOs, sockets).
  - Added support for comparing files' Unix owner/group/permissions.
  - macOS/Linux: Keyboard shortcuts are now suppressed when in an inline rename edit.
  - Fixed "Close Subfolders" to work on selection instead of just current line, matching "Open Subfolders" behavior.
  - Fixed "Compare Contents" incorrectly disabling "Binary" and "Rules-based" when the base folders are network servers (\\server), and incorrectly enabling them when the selection is within an expanded snapshot file.
  - Fixed archive files created on a Unix system and stored on a Windows disk sorting incorrectly when sorting by the "Attribute" column.
  - Windows: Fixed log always being closed in new views on high DPI monitors.
  - Windows: Fixed log height not scaling when moving between monitors with different scaling.
  FTP / Cloud Services
  - Changed how saved passwords are stored. Exported profiles are compatible with previous versions, but downgrading an install will treat the passwords as blank.

  - Fixed poor behavior when entering certain malformed URLs.
  - macOS: FTP Profile > Server > Time zone edit no longer allows selecting folder items like "Africa" as a timezone.

  - Linux: Updated .deb packages for Deb822.
  - Linux: Fixed .tar.gz package including an unintentional installer.sh, separate from the intended install.sh.

  - Linux: Fixed "Help" button not appearing on dialogs depending on the desktop environment.
  - macOS: Improved behavior of dropdown treeviews (e.g., FTP Profile > Server > Time zone).
  - macOS: Multi-select treeviews (e.g., Home view "Sessions" list) now toggle selection on Cmd+clicks rather than Ctrl+clicks.
  - macOS: Showing a window-modal dialog when quitting now disables other open windows and keeps the one showing a sheet on top.
