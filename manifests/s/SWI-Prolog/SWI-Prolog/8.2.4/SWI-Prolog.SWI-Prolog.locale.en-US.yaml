# Agreements: 
ReleaseNotes: |-
  [Jan 20 2021]
  - FIXED: Various small issues that allow using []/N (notably []/3) as a predicate. After report by Rick Workman.

  [Jan 13 2021]
  - DOC: Remove reference to -L, -G and -T options.

  [Jan 11 2021]
  - FIXED: Issue#767: print_term/2 for printing zero-argument compounds. Wouter Beek.
  - FIXED: Possible crash when creating a dict from a list if the list contains an invalid key.

  [Oct 5 2020]
  - FIXED: Crash when creating a dict from an invalid key.

  [Jan 8 2021]
  - FIXED: Issue#763: Attempt to create cycle import module dependency exception was not handled correctly. Reported by David Tonhofer.

  [Jan 4 2021]
  - FIXED: Windows swipl-win.exe console: check input messages before handling output such that e.g., Control-C works when the output is flooded.
  - MODIFIED: Allow processing interrupts in Windows when in critical state.
  - FIXED: Possible deadlock when passing Control-C from swipl-win.exe.
  - FIXED: possible race in swipl-win.exe output handling.
  - FIXED: sleep/1: interrupt processing for Windows.

  [Jan 2 2021]
  - FIXED: Issue#758: unify_with_occurs_check/2: possible false success when attributed variables are involved. Possibly may also involve cases where no attributed variables are involved. Reported by Jan Burse.

  [Dec 30 2020]
  - CLEANUP: Issue#128: silence `maybeUnregisterDirtyDefinition()` message for release build. Fabrizio Riguzzi.

  [Dec 27 2020]
  - BUILD: Issue#704: skip building the HTML docs if some dependency is missing.

  [Dec 24 2020]
  - FIXED: Possible crash of the debugger on the call port. We need to set PC to the new predicate before the trace callback or `clearUninitialisedVars()` may reset wrong variables.

  [Dec 23 2020]
  - FIXED: Issue#751: call_with_depth_limit/3 with limit -1. David Tonhofer. This patch also cleans up mixed types for handling the limit and possible limit overflows.

  - FIXED: Issue#747: Windows: expand_file_name/2 Unicode issues.

  [Dec 18 2020]

  - DOC: Fixed a type, added commas and needed spaces.

  [Dec 15 2020]
  - FIXED: is_git_directory/1 for submodules.
  - FIXED: Reloading library(git) due to operator conflict.
  - FIXED: is_git_directory/1 for submodules.

  [Dec 14 2020]
  - ENHANCED: Detection of Emacs inferior mode. Now sets up tty on Windows as we have no way to detect.

  [Dec 13 2020]

  [Dec 11 2020]
  - FIXED: Backport of 06e3e152a83ec786a689085274d49da1e56b9287 from devel: FIXED: Possible race condition in retract/1 generation management.

  [Dec 7 2020]
  - FIXED: atomic_list_concat/3: possible double free, corrupting memory.

  [Dec 5 2020]

  [Dec 3 2020]
  - FIXED: Make library(prolog_codewalk) work with `name()` predicate heads.
  - FIXED: Do not set a Prolog flag if the hook dealing with the side effect fails.
  - ENHANCED: halt if we tried to handle exit from a thread twice.

  [Dec 1 2020]
  - ADDED: library(sandbox): declare nonground/2 as safe.

  [Nov 30 2020]
  - DOC: Avoid duplicate section label.

  [Nov 27 2020]
