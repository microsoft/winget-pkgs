  Important Notes
  System Requirements Clarification: My strategy is to extend support to the most prevalent versions across various platforms. Unmaintained or obsolete platform versions will gradually be excluded from my support commitment. This approach encourages users to operate this application in a secure, updated environment. Nonetheless, I provide the ability to tweak certain build options (usually without altering the source code) to ensure compatibility with older platforms.Please be aware: Starting from this version, I will not be bundling .deb packages with binary releases due to download limitations and the significant time investment required for packaging. However, you still have the option to compile and package your own .deb.Enhanced Compatibility with macOS Apple Silicon: This update has been meticulously optimized to fully support macOS's M1/M2 chips. I have personally verified the performance and functionality on actual hardware. Consequently, the "x86_64" identifier will no longer appear in the name of macOS binary releases.What's Changed
