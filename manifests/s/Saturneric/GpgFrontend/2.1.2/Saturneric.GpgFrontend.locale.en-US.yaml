  Next Steps
  The journey to version 2.1.2 took an unexpected half year, primarily due to extensive modifications in the core architecture and some challenging setbacks. This process, while arduous, was a period of significant learning and development. The application, once scattered, has now been meticulously reassembled. As a result of these efforts, it now functions smoothly and effectively.In light of this experience, the focus for the next 4â€“5 versions will be on stability and minor enhancements. My commitment is to release a new, refined version every 2-3 months, ensuring consistent improvements without overwhelming changes.Flatpak
  With great pleasure, I announce that our application is now accessible on Flathub.What's New
