  What's New
  New Application Icon
  I've introduced a sleek, modern design for the application icon.For Users
  - Added Qt5 Version of AppImage: Due to the unavailability of Qt6 on Ubuntu 20.04, I've introduced a Qt5 version of the AppImage to ensure the application remains accessible to users on this platform.
  - Fixed Local Time Display: The previously inaccurate local time display has been corrected.
  - Enhanced GnuPG Controller: The GnuPG Controller can now be opened without triggering a restart if no settings have been changed.
  - Resolved High CPU Usage: I have addressed the issue causing high CPU usage while using the File Tab.
  - Updated UI Icons: Menu buttons have been updated with more suitable icons.
  - Customizable UI Themes: Users can now switch between different themes, enhancing personalization.
  - Modular Updates: "Version Checking" and "GnuPG Info Gathering" have been modularized, allowing users to disable or delete these functions as desired.
  - New Module Controller: A new system for managing application modules has been implemented for greater control.
  - Improved Translations: Enhancements to German and Simplified Chinese translations have been made, with invitations open for further community contributions.
  - Language Settings Update: English is now available in the Language Settings. For more information, see Issue #135.
  For Developers
  - New User Manual Repository: Access the updated manual at GpgFrontend Manual Repository.
  - Enhanced Module System: The module system has become more isolated and flexible, with plugins now loaded and activated at runtime.
  - Switch to Qt 6.5 LTS: I have upgraded to Qt 6.5 LTS to ensure longer support and enhanced stability.
  - Flatpak Platform Update: The Flatpak container runtime "org.kde.Platform" has been upgraded to branch 6.6.
  Plans & Considerations
  - Ongoing Improvements: I will continue to address discovered issues and enhance the user manual to improve the user experience.
  - Continued SDK Development: Development of the SDK and module system will proceed, enabling users to create their own modules.
  - Function Modularization: I aim to convert more functions into modules to boost the application's stability and customizability.
  - New Modules Under Consideration:
      - Matrix Functions
      - Email Functions
      - Smart Card Functions
