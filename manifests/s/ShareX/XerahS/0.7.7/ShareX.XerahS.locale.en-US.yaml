  Full Changelog: v0.7.4...v0.7.7
  macOS Permissions (Screen Recording)
  Screen capture on macOS requires Screen Recording permission:
  1. Open System Settings > Privacy & Security > Screen Recording.
  2. Enable XerahS for screen capture access.
  3. Restart the app after granting permission.
  macOS Permissions (Global Hotkeys)
  Global hotkeys use SharpHook and need Accessibility permission:
  1. Open System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility.
  2. Enable XerahS (or the published app bundle) for accessibility access.
  3. Restart the app and retest hotkeys.
  macOS Troubleshooting ("App is damaged")
  If you see a message saying "XerahS is damaged and can't be opened", it is due to macOS security (Gatekeeper) on quarantined downloads. To fix it:
  1. Open Terminal.
  2. Type the following command (do not hit Enter yet):
     xattr -cr
  3. Drag the XerahS.app file from Finder into the Terminal window (this pastes the full path).
  4. Only now, press Enter.
