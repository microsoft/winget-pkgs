  1:
  See Cache File and Migration.
  2:
  Rule set is independent collections of rules that can be compiled into binaries to improve performance. Compared to legacy GeoIP and Geosite resources, it can include more types of rules, load faster, use less memory, and update automatically. See Route#rule_set, Route Rule, DNS Rule, Rule Set, Source Format and Headless Rule. For GEO resources migration, see Migrate GeoIP to rule sets and Migrate Geosite to rule sets.
  3:
  New commands manage GeoIP, Geosite and rule set resources, and help you migrate GEO resources to rule sets.
  4:
  Logical rules in route rules, DNS rules, and the new headless rule now allow nesting of logical rules.
  5:
  The private GeoIP country never existed and was actually implemented inside V2Ray. Since GeoIP was deprecated, we made this rule independent, see Migration.
  6:
  JSON parse errors will now include the current key path. Only takes effect when compiled with Go 1.21+.
  7:
  All internal DNS queries now skip DNS rules with server type fakeip, and the default DNS server can no longer be fakeip. This change is intended to break incorrect usage and essentially requires no action.
  8:
  See TUN inbound and WireGuard outbound.
  9:
  When URLTest is idle for a certain period of time, the scheduled delay test will be paused.
  10:
  Added some new fingerprints. Also, starting with this release, uTLS requires at least Go 1.20.
  11:
  Updated cloudflare-tls, gomobile, smux, tfo-go and wireguard-go to latest, quic-go to 0.40.1 and gvisor to 20231204.0
