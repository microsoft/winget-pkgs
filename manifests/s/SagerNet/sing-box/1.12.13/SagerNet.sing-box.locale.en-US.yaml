  📝 Release Notes
  - Fix naive inbound
  - Fixes and improvements
  - Unfortunately, for non-technical reasons, we are currently unable to notarize the standalone version of the macOS client: because system extensions require signatures to function, we have had to temporarily halt its release.
    We plan to fix the App Store release issue and launch a new standalone desktop client, but until then, only clients on TestFlight will be available (unless you have an Apple Developer Program and compile from source code).
