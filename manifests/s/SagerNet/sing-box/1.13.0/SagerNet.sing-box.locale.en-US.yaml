  1:
  NaiveProxy outbound now supports QUIC, ECH, UDP over TCP, and configurable QUIC congestion control.
  Only available on Apple platforms, Android, Windows and some Linux architectures.
  Each Windows release includes libcronet.dll —
  ensure this file is in the same directory as sing-box.exe or in a directory listed in PATH.
  See NaiveProxy outbound.
  2:
  auto_redirect now allows you to bypass sing-box for connections based on routing rules.
  A new rule action bypass is introduced to support this feature. When matched during pre-match, the connection will bypass sing-box and connect directly.
  This feature requires Linux with auto_redirect enabled.
  See Pre-match and Rule Action.
  3:
  auto_redirect now rejects MPTCP connections by default to fix compatibility issues.
  You can change it to bypass sing-box via the new exclude_mptcp option.
  Adds a fallback iproute2 rule checked after system default rules (32766: main, 32767: default),
  ensuring traffic is routed to the sing-box table when no route is found in system tables.
  The rule index can be customized via auto_redirect_iproute2_fallback_rule_index (default: 32768).
  See TUN.
  4:
  Adds chrome as a new certificate store option alongside mozilla.
  Both stores filter out China-based CA certificates.
  See Certificate.
  5:
  See DNS-01 Challenge.
  6:
  sing-box can now monitor Wi-Fi state on Linux and Windows to enable routing rules based on wifi_ssid and wifi_bssid.
  See Wi-Fi State.
  7:
  See TLS.
  8:
  Adds kernel_tx and kernel_rx options for TLS inbound.
  Enables kernel-level TLS offloading via splice(2) on Linux 5.1+ with TLS 1.3.
  See TLS.
  9:
  sing-box can now proxy ICMP echo (ping) requests.
  A new icmp network type is available for route rules.
  Supported from TUN, WireGuard and Tailscale inbounds to Direct, WireGuard and Tailscale outbounds.
  The reject action can also reply to ICMP echo requests.
  10:
  New rule items for matching based on interface IP addresses, available in route rules, DNS rules and rule-sets.
  11:
  Matches outbounds' preferred routes.
  For Tailscale: MagicDNS domains and peers' allowed IPs. For WireGuard: peers' allowed IPs.
  12:
  The local DNS server now uses platform-native resolution:
  getaddrinfo/libresolv on Apple platforms, systemd-resolved DBus on Linux.
  A new prefer_go option is available to opt out.
  See Local DNS.
  13:
  The default TCP keep-alive initial period has been updated from 10 minutes to 5 minutes.
  See Dial Fields.
  14:
  Adds the Linux socket option IP_BIND_ADDRESS_NO_PORT support when explicitly binding to a source address.
  This allows reusing the same source port for multiple connections, improving scalability for high-concurrency proxy scenarios.
  See Dial Fields.
  15:
  Tailscale endpoint can now create a system TUN interface to handle traffic directly.
  New relay_server_port and relay_server_static_endpoints options for incoming relay connections.
  See Tailscale endpoint.
  16:
  CCM (Claude Code Multiplexer) service allows you to access your local Claude Code subscription remotely through custom tokens, eliminating the need for OAuth authentication on remote clients.
  See CCM.
  17:
  See OCM.
  18:
  Due to maintenance difficulties, sing-box 1.13.0 requires at least Go 1.24 to compile.
  19:
  Due to maintenance difficulties, sing-box 1.13.0 will be the last version to support Android 5.0,
  and only through a separate legacy build (with -legacy-android-5 suffix).
  For standalone binaries, the minimum Android version has been raised to Android 6.0,
  since Termux requires Android 7.0 or later.
  20:
  This update fixes missing padding extension for Chrome 120+ fingerprints.
  Also, documentation has been updated with a warning about uTLS fingerprinting vulnerabilities.
  uTLS is not recommended for censorship circumvention due to fundamental architectural limitations;
  use NaiveProxy instead for TLS fingerprint resistance.
