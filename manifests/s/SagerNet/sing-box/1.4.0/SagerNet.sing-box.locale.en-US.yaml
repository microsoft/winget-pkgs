  1:
  See TUIC inbound
  and TUIC outbound
  2:
  This is the TUIC port of the UDP over TCP protocol, designed to provide a QUIC stream based UDP relay mode that TUIC does not provide. Since it is an add-on protocol, you will need to use sing-box or another program compatible with the protocol as a server.
  This mode has no positive effect in a proper UDP proxy scenario and should only be applied to relay streaming UDP traffic (basically QUIC streams).
