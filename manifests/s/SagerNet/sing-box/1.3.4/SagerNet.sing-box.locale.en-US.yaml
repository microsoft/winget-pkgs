ReleaseNotes: |-
  Fixes and improvements
  We're now on the App Store üçé, always free! It should be noted that due to stricter and slower review, the release of Store versions will be delayed.
  We've made a standalone version of the macOS üçè client (the original Application Extension relies on App Store distribution), which you can download as SFM-version-universal.zip in the release artifacts.
