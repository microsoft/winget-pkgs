  1:New rule actions replace legacy inbound fields and special outbound fields,
  and can be used for pre-matching 2.See Rule, Rule Action, DNS Rule and DNS Rule Action.For migration, see Migrate legacy special outbounds to rule actions, Migrate legacy inbound fields to rule actions and Migrate legacy DNS route options to rule actions.2:Similar to Surge's pre-matching.Specifically, new rule actions allow you to reject connections with TCP RST (for TCP connections) and ICMP port unreachable (for UDP packets) before connection established to improve tun's compatibility.See Rule Action.3:When gvisor tun stack is enabled, even if the request passes routing, if the outbound connection establishment fails, the connection still does not need to be established and a TCP RST is replied.4:Route options in DNS route actions will no longer be considered deprecated, see DNS Route Action.Also, now udp_disable_domain_unmapping and udp_connect can also be configured in route action, see Route Action.5:When using in graphical clients, new routing rule items allow you to match on network type (WIFI, cellular, etc.), whether the network is expensive, and whether Low Data Mode is enabled.See Route Rule, DNS Route Rule and Headless Rule.6:Similar to Surge's strategy.New options allow you to connect using multiple network interfaces, prefer or only use one type of interface,  configure a timeout to fallback to other interfaces.See Dial Fields, Rule Action and Route.7:See DNS.8:See Rule Action and
  Migrate destination override fields to route options.9:The new WireGuard endpoint combines inbound and outbound capabilities,
  and the old outbound will be removed in sing-box 1.13.0.See Endpoint, WireGuard Endpoint
  and Migrate WireGuard outbound fields to route options.10:For WireGuard outbound and endpoint, GSO will be automatically enabled when available, see WireGuard Outbound.For TUN, GSO has been removed, see Deprecated.11:See Rule Action.12:See Hysteria2.13:See Hysteria2.14:When up_mbps and down_mbps are set, ignore_client_bandwidth instead denies clients from using BBR CC.
