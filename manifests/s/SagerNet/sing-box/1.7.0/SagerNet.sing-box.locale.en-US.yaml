  1:
  If enabled, for UDP proxy requests addressed to a domain, the original packet address will be sent in the response instead of the mapped domain.
  This option is used for compatibility with clients that do not support receiving UDP packets with domain addresses, such as Surge.
  2:
  Introduced in V2Ray 5.10.0.
  The new HTTPUpgrade transport has better performance than WebSocket and is better suited for CDN abuse.
  3:
  Starting in 1.7.0, multiplexing support is no longer enabled by default and needs to be turned on explicitly in inbound options.
  4:
  Hysteria Brutal Congestion Control Algorithm in TCP. A kernel module needs to be installed on the Linux server, see TCP Brutal for details.
  5:
  Only supported in graphical clients on Android and iOS.
