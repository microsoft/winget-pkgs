ShortDescription: Total Mail Converter Pro converts MSG and EML to PDF, DOC, TXT, HTML, HTMLX, TIFF, RTF documents and images (TIFF, JPEG).
Description: |-
  Total Mail Converter Pro converts MSG and EML to PDF, DOC, TXT, HTML, HTMLX, TIFF, RTF documents and images (TIFF, JPEG). While other email converters only extract and save attached files in their original formats, the Pro version is unique - it converts attachments as well. For example, if you have an email with a doc attachment, Total Mail Converter Pro can convert both the message and the attachment to PDF as part of a single operation.
  - Attachments saved in DOC, TXT, RTF, PDF, HTML, XLS, and OpenOffice formats can be converted to DOC, RTF, TXT, HTML, HTMLX, JPEG, TIFF, or PDF.
  - Attachments can be inserted as clickable links into converted emails.
  - With multi-page formats, you can combine several emails into one PDF, DOC or TIFF file.
  - Rename output files using macros (name, date, sender, subject, etc.). Attachments can be given descriptive names as well.
  - Find out how lawyers save hours with Total Mail Converter Pro.
  - Control document appearance by fine-tuning your output files' display options; change the fonts, colors, styles and more. Alternately, you can choose to include any external CSS scheme.

  Total Mail Converter Pro is built around a powerful engine and was designed to help save hours if not days worth of time. It easily processes hundreds of thousands of MSG/EML files through its batch feature, and puts you in the driver's seat through a robust set of customization options.
