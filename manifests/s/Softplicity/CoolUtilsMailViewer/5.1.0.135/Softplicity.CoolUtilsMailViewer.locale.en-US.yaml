Description: |-
  Coolutils' Mail Viewer is a free program that lets you view MSG, EML, EMLX, P7M, ICS, VCF and winmail.dat (TNEF) files. Although Microsoft's MSG format is great for storing emails, there just aren't many ways to access and view those files outside of the Outlook server Exchange client. Added to that, Microsoft's EML format (associated with Outlook Express) also gives users problems when trying to open and view.

  The good news is - we can help! If you're stuck trying to open MSG or EML files but don't have access to your Outlook client, CoolUtils' Mail Viewer is the perfect solution. Not only does it let you open and view MSG and EML files from anywhere; it's free, and by free we mean totally free for home users. No hidden downloads, no ads, no toolbars, no having to pay later: 100% free!

  CoolUtils Mail Viewer is also capable of generating a "fact file" related to your emails. Made available to you in your choice of TXT, PDF, XLS, CSV, or HTML these reports are able to provide you with valuable data re: your email activity. All you need to do is choose which fields you'd like to report on; Sender, Recipient, Date, Attachment, etc. Tune the report to your needs by including only specific fields, or examine them all!
