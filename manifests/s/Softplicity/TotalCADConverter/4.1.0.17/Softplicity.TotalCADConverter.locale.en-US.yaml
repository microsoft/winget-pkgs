Description: |-
  Total CAD Converter converts CAD files to PDF, TIFF, JPEG, BMP, WMF, PNG, DXF, BMP, CGM, HPGL, SVG, PS, and SWF. Source formats include dxf, dwg, dwf, dwfx, plt, hg, hgl, hpg, plo, hp, hpl, hpgl, hp1, hp2, hpgl2, gl2, spl, svg, cgm. Total CAD Converter's user-friendly interface and built-in wizard make it easy to apply project settings (it will even auto-remember previous job settings so that next time you won't need to recreate them from scratch). Total CAD Converter also includes support for project set-up via the command line.

  Total CAD Converter offers several unique options when converting lots of CAD files at once:
  - When you convert multiple CAD files to PDF or TIFF you can combine all source files into a single target file. For instance, convert five CAD drawings into one multi-page TIFF or PDF.
  - When converting CAD files to images you can resize, crop and rotate them simultaneously.

  This powerful AutoCAD converter will help you to turn your CAD drawings into black and white or increase the line weight scale, making the lines more visible
