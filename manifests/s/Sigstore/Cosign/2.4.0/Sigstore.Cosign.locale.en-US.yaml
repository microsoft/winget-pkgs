ShortDescription: Code signing and transparency for containers and binaries
Moniker: cosign
ReleaseNotes: |-
  v2.4.0 begins the modernization of the Cosign client, which includes:
  - Support for the newer Sigstore specification-compliant bundle format
  - Support for providing trust roots (e.g. Fulcio certificates, Rekor keys)
  through a trust root file, instead of many different flags
  - Conformance test suite integration to verify signing and verification behavior
  In future updates, we'll include:
  - General support for the trust root file, instead of only when using the bundle
  format during verification
  - Simplification of trust root flags and deprecation of the
  Cosign-specific bundle format
  - Bundle support with container signing
  We have also moved nightly Cosign container builds to GHCR instead of GCR.Features
  - Add new bundle support to verify-blob and verify-blob-attestation (#3796)
