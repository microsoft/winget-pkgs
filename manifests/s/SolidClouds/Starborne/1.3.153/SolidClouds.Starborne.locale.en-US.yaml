ShortDescription: A free PC Space MMORTS game set in a rich Sci-Fi world
Description: >
  Starborne Sovereign Space is not a persistent MMO - instead, new servers are launched regularly,
  and each game lasts for a few weeks and is then over. Our latest game server is open now.
  Start playing before it fills up.
