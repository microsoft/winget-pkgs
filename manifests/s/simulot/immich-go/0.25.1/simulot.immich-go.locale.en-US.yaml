ShortDescription: An alternative to the immich-CLI command that doesn't depend on nodejs installation.
Description: Immich-Go is an open-source tool designed to streamline uploading large photo collections to your self-hosted Immich server. It doesn't require NodeJS or Docker for installation. This makes it easy to get started, even for those less familiar with technical environments.
