ReleaseNotes: |-
  Be Nice with the Immich Server Release
  This release addresses the internal errors (500) that have been occurring in Immich over the past few months. These errors happen when metadata is updated through an API call while the image is being processed by an Immich background job. This results in either an error in immich-go or an error in Immich's logs, leaving some files unprocessed.
  The Immich team is actively working on resolving this issue. For more details, please refer to the pull request #17561 on GitHub.
  As a mitigation measure, immich-go now pauses all Immich background jobs during the upload process. This feature is controlled by the option --pause-immich-jobs, which is enabled by default. Consequently, the server's activity remains minimal during the upload.
  To control Immich's jobs, the API key of an Immich administrator is required. This key must be provided when uploading photos for a regular user. You can pass the admin key using the option --admin-api-key in addition to the regular user's key.
  A big thank to @ivaninkv for his contribution.
