ShortDescription: An alternative to the immich-CLI command that doesn't depend on nodejs installation.
Description: Immich-Go is an open-source tool designed to streamline uploading large photo collections to your self-hosted Immich server. It doesn't require NodeJS or Docker for installation. This makes it easy to get started, even for those less familiar with technical environments.

  Faster
  PaulSonOfLars has significantly improved the performance of immich-go when the source of photos is located on a network folder. In his environment, the performance boost is remarkable, going from uploading one picture every 2 seconds to 25 pictures per second: a near 50x increase.
  A heartfelt thank you to PaulSonOfLars for this incredible contribution.
