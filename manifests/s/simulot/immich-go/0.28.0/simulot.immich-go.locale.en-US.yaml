ShortDescription: An alternative to the immich-CLI command that doesn't depend on nodejs installation.
Description: Immich-Go is an open-source tool designed to streamline uploading large photo collections to your self-hosted Immich server. It doesn't require NodeJS or Docker for installation. This makes it easy to get started, even for those less familiar with technical environments.

  Parallel Uploads
  On the immich-go side, upload operations are primarily limited by I/O, whether reading takeouts and files or sending files to the server. To improve upload throughput, @jonathan-teamstatus proposed enabling parallel uploads.
  On my machine, the best performance is achieved when the number of parallel uploads matches the number of cores, resulting in a 2.5x performance gain. I set the default value for the parameter --concurrent-uploads with the number of available cores.
  Server jobs are paused during the upload (as before), allowing the upload to run at full speed. Once complete, server jobs resume, and the heavy lifting begins (thumbnails, machine learning, video encoding, etc.).

  Noteworthy changes
  Fixed: job pausing / resuming:
  Only the jobs "thumbnailGeneration", "metadataExtraction", "videoConversion", "faceDetection", "smartSearch" are paused. Those jobs are resumed at the end of the run.
  Fixed: Windows #1010:
  The windows folders are now correctly parsed
  Fixed: Album creation when uploading from an immich server
