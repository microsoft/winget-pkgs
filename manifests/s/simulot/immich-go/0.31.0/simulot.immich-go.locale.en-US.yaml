ShortDescription: An alternative to the immich-CLI command that doesn't depend on nodejs installation.
Description: Immich-Go is an open-source tool designed to streamline uploading large photo collections to your self-hosted Immich server. It doesn't require NodeJS or Docker for installation. This makes it easy to get started, even for those less familiar with technical environments.

  Release Notes - v0.31.0
  This release focuses on richer visibility while uploading assets and a major refresh of the CI/CD system that keeps Immich Go healthy across every platform.
  ✨ New Features
  - Live terminal tracking – The TUI now exposes separate discovery and processing zones, FileArchived counters, and per-asset size tracking so you can immediately tell what is being scanned, uploaded, or archived.
  - Better metadata insight – FileProcessor records processed assets (including metadata-only updates) and publishes dedicated events, yielding more accurate progress reporting and easier troubleshooting.
  🚀 Improvements
  - Globbing resilience – Folder traversal keeps going when the filesystem throws access errors and now surfaces clearer documentation about supported patterns.
  - Upload ergonomics – Standardized error-handling flags across upload commands and improved UI layout by right-aligning size columns, making long-running jobs easier to read.
  🐛 Bug Fixes
  - Album flag conflict – --folder-as-album=NONE no longer clashes with --into-album, so you can explicitly skip derived album names while still targeting a destination album.
  🔧 Internal Changes
  - Revamped CI/CD – Introduced a two-stage fast-feedback + secure E2E workflow, nightly Immich E2E runs, fork-safe triggering, and far more robust helper scripts (doc-only detection, jq fixes, empty-diff handling, standardized formatting).
  - Safer E2E workflow – External contributors now rely on an approval gate (or /run-e2e comment), and the workflow dispatch code was hardened with better payload validation, environment routing, and completion reporting.
  - Broader coverage – Added an album-upload E2E test, refreshed dependency stack (tcell v2.11.0, crypto v0.45.0), and removed legacy journal/reporting structures in favor of a unified FileProcessor + new file-event codes.
