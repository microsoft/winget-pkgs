ShortDescription: An alternative to the immich-CLI command that doesn't depend on nodejs installation.
Description: Immich-Go is an open-source tool designed to streamline uploading large photo collections to your self-hosted Immich server. It doesn't require NodeJS or Docker for installation. This makes it easy to get started, even for those less familiar with technical environments.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  This release focuses on improving the handling of potential file duplication sources to minimize duplicate uploads to the Immich server. The goal is to reduce internal errors and bad requests.
  The duplication check has been refactored to use files' checksums, which requires Immich-go to read files entirely before uploading. This may slow down the process.
