ShortDescription: An alternative to the immich-CLI command that doesn't depend on nodejs installation.
Description: Immich-Go is an open-source tool designed to streamline uploading large photo collections to your self-hosted Immich server. It doesn't require NodeJS or Docker for installation. This makes it easy to get started, even for those less familiar with technical environments.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Improved Handling of Potential Duplicates to Prevent Immich Errors
  - For albums
  - For tags
  - For uploaded assets returning a duplicate status
  - For photos duplicated with different names
  This release aims to resolve the internal server errors recently reported in Immich. I'm awaiting error reports. Please run immich-go with the options --log-level=DEBUG --api-trace. Additionally, set the Immich environment variable IMMICH-LOG-LEVEL to debug (read more here).
