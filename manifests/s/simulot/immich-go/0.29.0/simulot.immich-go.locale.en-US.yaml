  Release Notes - v0.29.0
  This release brings powerful new filtering capabilities for the from-immich command and configuration file support, making it easier to manage complex migration scenarios.
  ✨ New Features
  - Advanced asset filtering for from-immich - Filter your Immich library with precision using:
    - --from-people - Filter by people/faces in photos
    - --from-tag - Filter by tags
    - --from-album, --from-no-album - Filter by albums, including assets not in any album
    - --from-city, --from-country, --from-state - Geographic filtering
    - --from-make, --from-model - Camera make and model filtering with validation
    - --from-archived, --from-trashed, --from-favorite - Filter by asset state
    - --from-minimal-rating - Filter by minimum rating
    - --from-partners - Exclude partner's shared photos
    - --from-date-range - Filter by a date range (dates, date, year)
    - --from-include-extensions, --from-exclude-extensions - Include/exclude file extensions (e.g., include .jpg but exclude .bmp)
    - --from-include-type - Select only videos or only photos
    Example:
    immich-go from-immich [server parameters] --from-people="John" --from-date=2024 --from-favorite
  - Configuration file support - Create YAML/TOML configuration files to manage settings across projects
    Configuration values can come from files, environment variables, or command-line flags, with clear logging of which source is used.
    Check the documentation for supported formats and usage at /docs/configuration.md.
  🚀 Improvements
  - Renamed --server-errors to --on-errors - More consistent flag naming across commands for error handling behavior
  - Better upload logging - Upload events now show asset details instead of just filenames, making it easier to track progress during large migrations
  - Enhanced configuration visibility - The application now logs:
    - Which configuration file is being used (if any)
    - Where each setting comes from (file, environment, or command-line)
    - All active flags and parameters at startup for easier debugging
  - Streamlined CLI structure:
    - Concurrency settings (e.g., --concurrent-upload) now available from the root command
    - Clearer separation between upload, archive, and from-* commands
    - Simplified from-folder command usage
  - Date range validation - Automatically prevents invalid date ranges where "before" is after "after"
  - Comprehensive documentation - New guides for installation, usage examples, migration scenarios, and performance tuning
  💥 Breaking Changes
  - Asset copy API change - If you use the API directly: ReplaceAsset method is deprecated in favor of CopyAsset, which uses the assets/copy endpoint
  - API key permissions update - API keys must now include asset.copy and asset.delete permissions in addition to previously required permissions. Please update your API keys accordingly.
  🔧 Internal Changes
  - Complete E2E testing infrastructure - Comprehensive automated testing with Linux and Windows clients, ensuring reliability across platforms
  - Improved CI/CD - Smarter test execution (skips E2E tests for documentation-only changes), updated GitHub Actions, unified workflow
  - Code quality - Updated to Immich API 2.0.0, better code organization, enhanced debugging capabilities
  - Developer tools - VS Code tasks for common operations, automated release workflow, development branch now named develop
