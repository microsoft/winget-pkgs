Description: |-
  Sante PACS Server PG is a DICOM 3.0 compliant PACS server, a Modality Worklist server, an HTTP (web) server for DICOM files and a CD/DVD Burning and Printing server that offers high performance and reliability at an affordable price.
  It provides connectivity to all DICOM modalities (CT, MR, US, CR, NM, XA, MG, DX etc.). Reviewing the DICOM images can be done using the Sante PACS Viewer (the Built-in full-featured DICOM viewer of the system). The built-in web server can be used as a free cloud server for DICOM files!

  If you have selected a cloud solution for DICOM file archiving, Sante PACS Server PG can be a perfect companion of this solution, not only because it can be used as a local backup server for the whole archive, accessible from the web as well, but furthermore because it can keep locally the older part of the archive that there is no need to be on the cloud. This way Sante PACS Server PG can reduce drastically the monthly cost of the cloud solution.
