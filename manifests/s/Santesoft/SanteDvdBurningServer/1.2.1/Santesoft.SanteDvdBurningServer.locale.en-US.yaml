ShortDescription: Sante DVD Burning Server can receive studies from medical scanners, PACS servers and DICOM viewers and automatically burn and print them in EPSON and PRIMERA CD/DVD producers.
Description: |-
  Sante DVD Burning Server can receive studies from medical scanners, PACS servers and DICOM viewers and automatically burn and print them in EPSON and PRIMERA CD/DVD producers. It acts like a usual PACS server, it writes all the received studies in its database, but additionally it sends them for CD/DVD burning and printing.

  Optionally, when it receives a report from EPSON/PRIMERA producer that the CD/DVD was created successfully the program deletes the burned and printed studies from the database, otherwise it keeps them in its database until the user solves the problem of the producer (e.g. refilling with consumables), or until the user creates the CD/DVD manually and deletes them. With this option disabled, the program can be used as a usual full-featured PACS server as well.
