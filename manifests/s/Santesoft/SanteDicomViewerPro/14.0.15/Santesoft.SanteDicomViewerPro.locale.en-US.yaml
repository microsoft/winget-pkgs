Description: |-
  Sante DICOM Viewer Pro is a professional DICOM viewer, anonymizer, converter, PACS client, mini PACS server, patient CD/DVD burner (with free DICOM viewer) and much more.

  Sante DICOM Viewer Pro is not a "yet another DICOM viewer" constructed with freely available libraries such as dcmtk, itk and vtk, like hundreds of other DICOM viewers which differ from each other only in the appearance, menus, panels and dialog boxes. It is a unique program with unique capabilities, designed and developed in-house by us, from the ground up, with the most advanced programming tools and it is the result of research and development on DICOM imaging of the last two decades. Sante DICOM Viewer Pro has been developed since 1999 and it is one of the most popular professional DICOM viewers worldwide.
