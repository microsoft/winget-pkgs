ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Fixed a few small memory leaks.
  - Fixed unnecessary copying of data while waiting for an audio buffer to become playable.
  - Gopher: Detect audio media type from file extension with the s item type (it's not always WAV).
  - Content that uses charset=utf-8 is checked for validity.
    If the encoding is invalid, the content is instead decoded as CP437 (if it has ANSI escapes; possibly it's ASCII art) or just Latin-1.
  - Remove ANSI escapes from window titles.
  - Modified rule for when 'text/plain' is assumed to actually be 'text/gemini' based on the file extension.
