ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Removed automatic horizontal scrolling of wide preformatted blocks.
    Instead, hold down the Shift key to scroll horizontally with the mouse wheel.
  - Fixed an event processing issue where some events were not handled as expected, for instance when opening a link into split view the opened link was not highlighted.
  - Fixed links not reacting to mouse hover after jumping to a heading from the Outline.
  - Fixed input prompt behaving strangely after changing font size. (Lines are now forced to rewrap after changing the font.)
  - Fixed mouse cursor not changing its shape in all open windows.
  - Updated UI translations.
  New/changed in v1.17
  - The Bookmarks menu lists all of your bookmarks and folders.
  - Snippets: A collection of short text segments that can be pasted into any input field via the context menu.
    For example, useful for your gemlog header/footer and other often-repeated parts.
  - Snippets can be managed in Preferences > Snippets and created by right-clicking on links or selected text on a page.
  - Custom search queries: Snippets whose name starts with a bang (e.g., "!w") can be invoked in the URL field to make customized queries.
    The snippet content should be a Gemini search URL, for example: "gemini://gemi.dev/cgi-bin/wp.cgi/search".
  - Quick lookup shows matching snippets as a new type of search result.
  - Keyboard shortcut Shift+1/‚áß1 for conveniently making a snippet query.
  - Input prompts, upload dialogs, and bookmark editors can be resized by dragging the left or right edge.
  - Text zooming in the upload text editor.
  - Gemtext syntax highlighting in the upload dialog.
  - Recently submitted input prompt contents are saved persistently and can be restored via the Ellipsis utility menu in the prompt dialog.
  - You can force the input prompt to appear before a certain URL is requested so you can enter a query string.
    This is useful for avoiding an extra request when it is known that a URL will require input (e.g., search engine, game input).
  - When importing links as bookmarks, you can optionally create subfolders from headings.
    You can also choose a destination folder for the imported bookmarks.
  - Quickly add/move a bookmark into a folder with the navbar bookmark button context menu (right-click on üè∑Ô∏è).
  - User-selectable feed refresh interval.
    Previously the interval been hardcoded to four hours. (Based on a patch by Michael Nordmeyer.)
  - Setting to never/always collapse preformatted blocks, disabling the ability to toggle the folding.
  - "Fold All" and "Unfold All" in Bookmarks sidebar context menu.
  - "Search" context menu item on selected text to make a search query with it.
  - "Use as Search URL" in link context menu.
  - "Mark All Links as Visited" in the Tools submenu.
  - Option --capslock: enable Caps Lock as a modifier in keybindings.
  - Option --theme (-t): change UI color theme of open Lagrange windows.
    Can be used in scripts to switch the theme automatically (for example, see the darkman utility; thanks to Jason McBrayer for suggesting this).
  - Support for the Nex protocol (nex://nightfall.city/nex/info/specification.txt).
  - Keyboard shortcut for deleting bookmarks (Backspace).
    Useful when the Bookmarks list has input focus.
  - macOS: System UI accent color can be chosen as the accent color.
  - Menus can have submenus.
    Several of the old menus were reorganized accordingly.
    For example, the page context menu has a Tools submenu for translation, Titan uploads, etc.
  - Show unsupported media types as plain text if the content is valid UTF-8 encoded text.
  - The page scrolls while selecting text near top/bottom.
  - Display a logo graphic in empty windows/tabs as a placeholder.
  - Visualize input focus in lists by drawing a focus rectangle around the current item.
  - Menu separators are taller and more distinct for a clearer item separation.
  - Adjusted colors of the Import Identity dialog.
  - Auto-hide sidebars when resizing a window/split if the document area would become narrower than the sidebar.
  - Tuned theme color palette and improved background colors of "Colorful Light".
  - Newly created client certificates have a default expiration date in the year 9999, which means they won't expire.
    One can still also set a specific date as before.
  - Periodically save UI state (including each tab's navigation history) to prevent data loss in case the app crashes.
    These runtime saves do not include any cached page content.
    The full cache is still saved as before when quitting the app.
