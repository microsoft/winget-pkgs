ShortDescription: Intuitive configuration software for safety products from SICK
Description: >
  Intuitive project planning of SICK safety sensors and safety controllers is
  carried out using the free Safety Designer configuration software. With the
  software, you simply select hardware components and link logic functions. For
  you, this means quick configuration of safety controllers, safety switches and
  other safety components. The documentation function, the diagnostic concept
  and the networking dialog function of the software provide crucial support for
  cost-saving engineering. This enables you to quickly commission even complex
  mobile applications and networked systems with many individual components.
