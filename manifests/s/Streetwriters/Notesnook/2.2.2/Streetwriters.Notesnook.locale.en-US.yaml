  Features & new stuff

  1. Bulk exports as HTML, MD or TXT ‒ you can now export all your notes as HTML, MD or TXT from Settings. This is available on all platforms.
  2. The most hated migration dialog has now been removed/replaced with a much less annoying but a lot more useful dialog.
  3. Backup restore process now reports live progress
  4. New scrollbars — the app now feels a lot smoother thanks to these new scrollbars. 
     This also fixes the issue where scrollbars would be hidden on different platforms & browsers.
  
  Fixes & Improvements
  
  1. Reduce minimum required macOS version to 10.12.0 (#1184)
  2. Fixed issue where clicking on an unselected task item toggled the selected task items (#1186)
  3. Clicking below a table (if it's the last element in the note) should now create a new paragraph (#1185)
  4. Fixed issue where free users could not assign already created tags to notes (#1187)
  5. Fixed issue where table row toolbar would get clipped on smaller screens (#1192)
  6. Fix issue where a single notebook, tag & topic could have duplicate shortcuts (#1177)
  7. Merge conflict detection has been greatly improved and now uses proper HTML-based diffing (#1183). This will reduce a lot of the false positive conflicts.
  8. Allow converting double spaced lines to single spaced lines (#1191)
  9. Tab key now adds a tab character when pressed inside the editor (#1193)
  10. Make editor title font-size relative to title length (#1194)
  11. Fixed Failed to execute 'decode' on 'TextDecoder' error (#1202)
  12. Fixed issue where drag/droping a task item at the very end of the task list would create a new task list (#1203)
  13. On desktop apps the migration process after an upgrade will be automated & won't require any user interaction (#1204)
  14. External scripts have been completely removed to enhance privacy. Notesnook loaded grammars for syntax highlighting in code blocks from https://esm.sh/; 
      this has now been removed and all needed scripts are loaded directly from https://app.notesnook.com/. This also means that the desktop apps can now be used 100% offline.
  15. Pane resizing has also been improved & will now feel more predictable.
  16. Tags autosuggest also got some love in this release & now doesn't pop up in the top-left corner when you change notes.
  17. Encrypted backups will now be automatically disabled when your trial ends
  18. Fixed issue where users with 2FA enabled would experience constant login loops during session expiry
  19. Fixed issue where notes screen would go blank on window resize

  There were a lot of other big & small issues fixed (too many to report). After this release Notesnook will feel a lot more stable in day-to-day usage. 
  Our primary focus right now is to improve the stability of the app — not to ship new features at risk of crashes, bugs & data loss.
