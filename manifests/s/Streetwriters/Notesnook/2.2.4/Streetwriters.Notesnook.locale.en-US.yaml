  Features & new stuff

  1. Preview trashed notes by @alihamuh in #1266

  3. Custom colors — You can now save custom colors in all editor color pickers by @alihamuh in #1312
  4. Tags now get included in all exports by default by @alihamuh in #1345
  5. Clear completed tasks — we have added a button that clears all completed tasks within a task list by @alihamuh in #1336

  5. Fixed issue where "Change backup location button" was not always visible by @alihamuh in #1321
  6. Improve HTML parsing performance which directly affects note saving performance by @thecodrr in #1314

  11. Improve sync connection reliability (getting rid of sync errors on app startup etc.) by @thecodrr in #1381
  12. Add streaming support for importing huge zips (i.e. you can now import all your notes from any other app no matter how many they are.
    I have tested this with > 1.5 GB worth of notes) by @thecodrr in #1380

  We had planned for this release to include the Web Clipper but unfortunately, due to some critical issues we'll be releasing it later this month (in a couple of days). The next release will also contain reminders (hopefully! no promises.) That's all. Good day!
