    I have tested this with > 1.5 GB worth of notes) by @thecodrr in #1380

  We had planned for this release to include the Web Clipper but unfortunately, due to some critical issues we'll be releasing it later this month (in a couple of days). The next release will also contain reminders (hopefully! no promises.) That's all. Good day!
