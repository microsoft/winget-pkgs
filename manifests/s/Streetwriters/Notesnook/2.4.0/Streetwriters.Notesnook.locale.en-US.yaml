  Features & new stuff

  1. Cross-platform reminders — Reminders are finally here! You can set a one-time reminder or daily, monthly & weekly recurring reminders. All reminders are automatically synced to all your devices.
  2. Sync controls — We are giving you full control over the whole syncing process. Disable auto sync, real-time editor sync or turn it off completely for an offline experience — it's up to you.
  3. Privacy mode on Desktop — The mobile app has had privacy mode for many, many versions and now desktop app gets it too. Privacy mode will exclude Notesnook from all kinds of screen capture i.e.,
     you can safely take notes while sharing your screen; the other person won't be able to see the Notesnook app. (Works only on macOS & Windows)
  4. Changing your account email is now possible (and it works just like you expect it to :D).
  5. New & improved login flow — (this deserves its very own blog post) we are taking Notesnook security up a notch by redesigning how our login works.
     After much brainstorming, we realized that your account password is the most important credential & keeping it safe should be our foremost priority. To that end, we have moved password entry to be the last step in login.
     Here's how it works:
      i. Enter email
      ii. Authenticate second factor (can be email, sms or authenticator app)
      iii. Enter password
      iv. And finally you are logged in.
  6. Improve PDF & HTML exports — Export formats are finally getting some love in this release. The exported PDFs (and HTML) should now properly format & style your task lists, code blocks, quotes, tables etc.
  7. Delete notes with a notebook/topic — Deleting a notebook/topic now gives you the option to also delete all the notes inside it.
  8. Images in editor now show a download button on selection (just like in attachments)
  9. Bypass CORS (using a configurable CORS proxy) when downloading & attaching images in editor — this allows Notesnook to download any & all external images you throw at it.
  10. Improved sync status — Sync status now correctly shows offline/disabled sync states. It also doesn't auto reset after a sync failure making it clear to you if a sync has failed.
