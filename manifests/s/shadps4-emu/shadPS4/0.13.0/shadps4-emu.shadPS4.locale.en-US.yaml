ReleaseNotes: |-
  Here we are again with an early Christmas present. Santa might not have reached your home yet, but shadPS4 will.
  This release brings the long-awaited Bloodborne speedup fix, along with a lot of AJM fixes from our great Roamic dev, who was kind enough to resolve some weird sound issues (God of War 3 and other games now almost have perfect sound).
  There are also many additional fixes; I’ll try to summarize as much as I can below.
  This release is dedicated to Matthew, who did a lot of work setting up our new shadps4.net site, so greetings to him as well.
  So, Merry Christmas to all of you out there. Let’s hope the new year comes with world peace and a bit more logic out there.
  Thank you all for your support!
