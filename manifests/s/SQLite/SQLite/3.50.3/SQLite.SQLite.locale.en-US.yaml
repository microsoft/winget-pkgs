ShortDescription: Self-contained transactional SQL database engine
Description: |-
  SQLite is an in-process library that implements a self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, transactional SQL database engine.
  SQLite is an embedded SQL database engine.
  Unlike most other SQL databases, SQLite does not have a separate server process.
  SQLite reads and writes directly to ordinary disk files.
  A complete SQL database with multiple tables, indices, triggers, and views, is contained in a single disk file.
