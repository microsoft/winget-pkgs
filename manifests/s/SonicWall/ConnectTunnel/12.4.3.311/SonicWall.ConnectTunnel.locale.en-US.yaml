ShortDescription: Connect Tunnel provides secure remote access for IT-managed devices.
Description: |-
  The Connect Tunnel provides an “in-office” experience for a remote working world with full access away from the office. For IT-managed Mac, Windows, and Linux users, this thin client delivers fast and secure remote access to sensitive corporate data and assets. For Windows 10 users, Connect Tunnel supports Device Guard, a Windows server component which enables secure authorized access.
  With Connect Tunnel, you always maintain centralized control because it integrates directly with SMA 1000 Unified Policy and End Point Control (EPC) to ensure a safe environment and a compliant device before allowing network access.
