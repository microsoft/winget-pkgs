ReleaseNotes: |-
  New Features
  - Removed experimental status from the sentry-cli build upload commands (#2899, #2905). At the time of this release, build uploads are still in closed beta on the server side, so most customers cannot use this functionality quite yet.
  - Added CLI version metadata to build upload archives (#2890).
  Deprecations
  - Deprecated the upload-proguard subcommand's --platform flag (#2863). This flag was a no-op for some time, so we will remove it in the next major.
  - Deprecated the upload-proguard subcommand's --android-manifest flag (#2891). This flag was a no-op for some time, so we will remove it in the next major.
  - Deprecated the sentry-cli sourcemaps upload command's --no-dedupe flag (#2913). The flag was no longer relevant for sourcemap uploads to modern Sentry servers and was made a no-op.
  Fixes
  - Fixed autofilled git base metadata (--base-ref, --base-sha) when using the build upload subcommand in git repos. Previously this worked only in the context of GitHub workflows (#2897, #2898).
  Performance
  - Slightly sped up the sentry-cli sourcemaps upload command by eliminating an HTTP request to the Sentry server, which was not required in most cases (#2913).
