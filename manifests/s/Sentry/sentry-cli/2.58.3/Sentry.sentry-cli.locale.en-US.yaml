  Improvements
  - For the sentry-cli build upload command, we now only auto-detect Git metadata when we detect we are running in a CI environment, unless the user manually overrides this behavior (#2974). This change prevents local development builds from triggiering GitHub status checks for size analysis.
    - We can detect most common CI environments based on the environment variables these set.
    - We introduced two new arguments, --force-git-metadata and --no-git-metadata, which force-enable and force-disable automatic Git data collection, respectively, overriding the default behavior.
  - The sentry-cli build upload command now automatically detects the correct branch or tag reference in non-PR GitHub Actions workflows (#2976). Previously, --head-ref was only auto-detected for pull request workflows. Now it works for push, release, and other workflow types by using the GITHUB_REF_NAME environment variable.
  Fixes
  - Fixed a bug where the sentry-cli sourcemaps inject command could inject JavaScript code into certain incorrectly formatted source map files, corrupting their JSON structure (#3003).
