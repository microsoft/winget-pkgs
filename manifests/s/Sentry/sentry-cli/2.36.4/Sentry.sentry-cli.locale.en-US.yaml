ReleaseNotes: |-
  This releases fixes includes a bugfix (#2171 by @szokeasaurusrex) for #2169. The bug caused any command run with sentry-cli monitors run to not be executed whenever sending the cron checkin to Sentry failed, e.g. during a Sentry outage or due to some other network failure. With the bugfix, we log the error and execute the program even when there was an error sending the checkin.
  We recommend that all users using sentry-cli monitors run upgrade to Sentry CLI version 2.36.4 immediately.
