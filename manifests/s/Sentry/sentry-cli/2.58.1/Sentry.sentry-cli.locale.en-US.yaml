ReleaseNotes: |-
  Deprecations
  - Deprecated API key authentication (#2934, #2937). Users who are still using API keys to authenticate Sentry CLI should generate and use an Auth Token instead.
  Improvements
  - The sentry-cli debug-files bundle-jvm no longer makes any HTTP requests to Sentry, meaning auth tokens are no longer needed, and the command can be run offline (#2926).
  Fixes
  - Skip setting base_sha and base_ref when they equal head_sha during auto-inference, since comparing a commit to itself provides no meaningful baseline (#2924).
  - Improved error message when supplying a non-existent organization to sentry-cli sourcemaps upload. The error now correctly indicates the organization doesn't exist, rather than incorrectly suggesting the Sentry server lacks artifact bundle support (#2931).
