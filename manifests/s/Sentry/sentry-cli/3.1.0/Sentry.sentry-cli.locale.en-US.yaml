ReleaseNotes: |-
  New Features
  - In the JavaScript API, added multi-project support to releases.newDeploy() method. This method now accept a projects option (array of project slugs), aligning them with the Rust CLI's multi-project capabilities and matching the existing behavior of releases.new() and releases.uploadSourceMaps() (#3001).
  Improvements
  - This release includes some changes to enable support for older self-hosted Sentry versions. With these changes, Sentry CLI now officially self-hosted Sentry versions 24.11.1 and above (#3070)
  Fixes
  - Fixed a bug that prevented project IDs from being used with the sentry-cli releases new command for users with self-hosted Sentry instances on versions older than 25.12.1 (#3068).
  - Fixed a bug, introduced in version 3.0.0, where the sentry-cli releases list command ignored the --project option (#3048). The command now correctly can filter releases by a single project when supplied via --project. This change does not enable filtering by multiple projects, which has never been supported.
