  New feature
  - feat(sourcemaps): Multi-project sourcemaps upload (#2497) by @szokeasaurusrex
    - Sourcemaps can now be uploaded to multiple projects at once by passing each project to the sentry-cli sourcemaps upload command, like so:
      sentry-cli sourcemaps upload -p project1 -p project2 /path/to/sourcemaps
    - Note that users on old versions of self-hosted Sentry may need to upgrade their self-hosted server to a newer version to take advantage of multi-project uploads.
