  Important Notice for ReadyAPI Customers
  Starting from ReadyAPI 3.62.0, VirtServer 3.29.0, and TestEngine1.34.0, SmartBear Product Family has fully deprecated file-based licenses and transitioned to the ID-based SmartBear License Management (SLM) system. Any customers still using file-based licenses must complete their migration to SLM by September 30, 2025.
  From October 1, 2025, existing and activated file-based licenses will continue to work for some time. However, SmartBear will no longer generate new file-based licenses or support activation and deactivation of file-based licenses in ReadyAPI, VirtServer, or TestEngine. All new and updated licenses are now issued in SLM only.
  All technical support for file-based licenses has now ceased, and SmartBear no longer maintains the file-based licensing system. Any access or service issues will result in service disruptions that we will not be able to restore.
  If you have not completed the process of migrating, contact your Account Manager or SmartBear representative today. Our teams are ready to assist with smooth transition strategies. For additional support, log a request with our Customer Care Team, who are standing by to help.
  For further information and timelines, refer to the File-Based License End-of-Life Policy page.

  ReadyAPI 3.62.0 includes a few changes which weâ€™re excited to share with you. See Version History for changes in previous releases.
  Licensing and Authentication Enhancements
  - File-Based Licensing Support Removed: In line with the End-of-Life policy for file-based licensing, support for Protection LS and file-based license types has been removed. The licensing code has been refactored to support only SLM licenses. For details about how this change affects multiple licensing topics, see Important Notice for ReadyAPI Customers.
  - SLM Offline Fingerprint: Enhanced the SLM offline license detach process. The checksum generated during uninstall now appears in the GUI and is stored in the ReadyAPI folder on the local machine, preventing loss if not immediately sent to your license administrator. For more information, see Free Offline Fixed-User License.
  - Username/Password Credentials in Automated Runs No Longer Supported in SLM On-Premise: The combination of username/password works only on On-Prem servers with version 1.3.1 or earlier. SLM On-Prem servers with versions 2.0 or later do not support this combination. As part of our licensing cleanup, this set of credentials is no longer supported starting in ReadyAPI 3.62.0. Use access key, accessforeveryone, or client credentials (if OIDC is enabled) instead. For more details, see Connecting to the SmartBear Hosted License Server (Online).
  User Interface Enhancements
  - Consistent Design for Add Test Step: Standardized the look and feel of the Add Test Step user experience as part of the ongoing ReadyAPI UI restyle project, scheduled for release later in 2025 and early 2026. For more information, see Add Test Step.
  - Accessibility Improvements: Introduced several accessibility improvements as part of an ongoing effort to comply with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).
  Upcoming Updates
  - TrustManager Enhancements (Coming in 3.63.0 and 3.64.0): ReadyAPI will add more granular TrustManager controls, requiring users to whitelist trusted certificates and providing a new UI to manage certificates safely in sandbox environments. For a full list of upcoming features and improvements, see Upcoming Updates.
  General Updates
  - Load Test Results: Updated the Load Test Graph and Table in the GUI. The test engine updates the chart and table approximately every second. The change converts TPS to an average for test steps and test cases once the test has ended, instead of a live per-second reading. The Graph and PDF Report now reflect the same data set consistently. For more details, see Global Metrics for Test Case.
  - Property Expansion on Kafka Test Steps: Added an option to enable Property Expansion on Kafka Test Step properties. For more information, see Property Expansion in Kafka.
  - Updated MSSQL JDBC Driver: Upgraded the Microsoft SQL Server JDBC driver to version 12.6 for improved compatibility and performance.
  - Password Library Replaced: Replaced the vt-password library with the Passay library in the Weak Password Assertion dependency. vt-password is no longer part of ReadyAPI.
  - Library Updates: ReadyAPI 3.62.0 includes newer versions of some libraries that version 3.61.0 used. If your scripts refer to classes from Libraries Updated in ReadyAPI 3.62.0, you might need to update the scripts.
  See Bug Fixes in ReadyAPI 3.62.0 for the list of fixes included in this patch.
