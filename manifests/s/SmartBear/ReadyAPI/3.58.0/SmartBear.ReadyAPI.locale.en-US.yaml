  Important Notice for ReadyAPI Customers
  ReadyAPI has fully transitioned to the ID-based SmartBear License Management (SLM) system. We are now moving into the final phase of deprecation of file-based licenses. Customers still using file-based licensing need to plan for migration to SLM before September 30, 2025.
  If you are still in the process of migrating or have yet to start, contact your Account Manager or SmartBear representative today. Our teams are ready to assist with smooth transition strategies. For additional support, please log a request with our Customer Care Team, who are standing by to help.
  For further information and timelines, please refer to this page.
  Welcome to the New ReadyAPI Documentation Experience
  We have updated the ReadyAPI product documentation to provide a more streamlined and consistent user experience across our entire product portfolio. While retaining all essential information, the updated documentation features a fresh design that makes it easier to navigate, read, and utilize.
  The new documentation experience offers several key benefits:
  - Enhanced panel structure and navigation: A reorganized layout for quicker, more intuitive access to content.
  - Improved search capabilities: Find information faster with a more powerful and precise search function.
  - Better usability: Simplified viewing and expanding of sections, making it easier to locate and understand relevant details.
  ReadyAPI 3.58.0 includes a few changes compared to the previous product version â€“ ReadyAPI 3.57.0. For information on the changes made to other versions, see Version History.
  Git and Collaboration Enhancements
  - New Force Pull Option for Git Integration: You can now use the Force Pull option in Git integration to override local changes and ensure the latest updates are pulled from the repository. For more information, visit this page.
  Conditional Match Enhancements
  - Enhanced Conditional Match Performance: The Conditional Match algorithm now processes requests faster, improving throughput for high-demand scenarios.
  - Optimized Conditional Match with Improved Hashing: We updated the hashing mechanism within the Conditional Match algorithm to significantly enhance performance during request matching.
  - Performance Boost with Optimized Conditional Match Array Management: We introduced the sizeOfConditionalMatchChildArray mechanism, which eliminates the need for a monitor lock, streamlining the performance of Conditional Match operations.
  - Faster Signature Sorting with Caching Mechanism: We implemented a caching system to expedite the sorting of signatures within the Conditional Match algorithm, ensuring faster and more efficient processing.
  General Enhancements
  - Library Updates: ReadyAPI 3.58.0 includes newer versions of some libraries that version 3.57.0 used. If your scripts refer to classes from these libraries, you might need to update the scripts.
