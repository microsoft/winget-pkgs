ReleaseNotes: |-
  Important Notice for ReadyAPI Customers
  Starting from ReadyAPI 3.62.0, VirtServer 3.29.0, and TestEngine 1.34.0, SmartBear has deprecated file-based licenses in favor of the ID-based SmartBear License Management (SLM) system. As of October 1, 2025, file-based licenses are no longer issued, activated/deactivated, or supported; all new and updated licenses are managed through SLM. For further information and timelines, refer to the File-Based License End-of-Life Policy page.

  ReadyAPI 3.65.0 includes a few changes that we are excited to share with you. See Version History for changes in previous releases.
  Authentication and Security Enhancements
  - Custom parameters for OAuth2 requests: ReadyAPI now supports adding custom parameters to a standard OAuth2 request body. You can enable an option to include additional key–value pairs, which ReadyAPI appends to the request body. For details, see 2. Configure Authorization.
  Property Expansion and Data Handling
  - Advanced type casting for Property Expansion: ReadyAPI now stores the value type as part of Property Expansion when it creates magic strings, based on the response value. During request execution, ReadyAPI attempts to cast the request value to the stored type. If casting fails, ReadyAPI sends the value without casting and logs a detailed error message. A new preference, Advanced type casting for Property Expansion, lets you enable or disable this behavior. For details, see Enabling Conditional Match Property Expansion and Example: Adding a type to a property expansion. This capability is supported in VirtServer 3.31.0. For recommended ReadyAPI and VirtServer version pairings, see the ReadyAPI-VirtServer Compatibility Matrix.
  SmartBear AI and Licensing Updates
  - Improved error handling when SmartBear AI is disabled in SLM: ReadyAPI has improved error handling when SmartBear AI is disabled for ReadyAPI in SLM. When SmartBear AI is disabled in SLM, ReadyAPI now disables it in the application.
  - Removed SmartBear AI button for offline licenses: SmartBear AI is not available for SLM Offline and SLM On-Prem licenses at this time. ReadyAPI now removes the Open SmartBear AI button from GUI when SLM Offline and SLM On-Prem licenses are installed to prevent confusion for offline users.
  General Updates
  - Updated tutorial links: ReadyAPI updates tutorial links to improve accuracy and ensure alignment with current product capabilities.
  - Library Updates: ReadyAPI 3.65.0 includes newer versions of some libraries that version 3.64.0 used. If your scripts refer to classes from Libraries Updated in ReadyAPI 3.65.0, you may need to update the scripts.
  See Bug Fixes in ReadyAPI 3.65.0 for the list of fixes included in this patch.
