ReleaseNotes: |-
  Important Notice for ReadyAPI Customers
  ReadyAPI has fully transitioned to the ID-based SmartBear License Management (SLM) system. We are now moving into the final phase of the deprecation of file-based licenses. Customers still using file-based licensing must plan for migration to SLM before September 30, 2025.
  If you are in the process of migrating or have not started yet, contact your Account Manager or SmartBear representative today. Our teams are ready to assist with smooth transition strategies. For additional support, log a request with our Customer Care Team, who are standing by to help.
  For further information and timelines, refer to the File-Based License End-of-Life Policy page.
  ReadyAPI 3.61.0 includes a few changes which we’re excited to share with you. For information on the changes made to other versions, see Version History.
  Conditional Match Enhancements
  - Added new route option for Conditional Match: The virtual service now includes a Route and Record for the Conditional Match route option. This option routes all incoming requests and automatically creates virtual operations for requests without existing operations. It records both request and response data and creates the matching Conditional Match and Signature. For more details, see Route and Record for Conditional Match.
  - Enabled Data Type Specification in Conditional Match: You can now specify data types in the Conditional Match Editor. This improvement helps resolve parsing and validation issues for tests that use strict typing. For more information, see Parameter Value Types in Conditional Match Editor.
  OpenAPI 3.1 Enhancements
  - Added Callback Support: You can now define callbacks under REST methods. Each callback is read-only, inherits its endpoint from the parent resource, and stays in sync with request parameters. Callbacks help you document and structure asynchronous behavior, such as webhook-style responses. For details, see Working with Callbacks.
  - Support for MutualTLS Authentication: ReadyAPI now handles mutualTLS auth during OpenAPI 3.1 import and export. On import, it alerts you to configure SSL client certificates. On export, it adds mutualTLS schemes based on configured SSL keystores, generating separate schemes for multiple keystores.
  - Support for Reusable Path Item Objects: ReadyAPI now supports Reusable Path Item Objects in OpenAPI 3.1. It correctly imports path objects defined with $ref, resolving them at the resource, method, and request levels.
  - Added apiKey Security Scheme Support: The importer now supports apiKey security schemes, handling authentication automatically and securely during API import.
  General Enhancements
  - Updated JMS Support to Use Jakarta Namespace: We upgraded ReadyAPI to use the latest jakarta.jms-api library and replaced the related imports. This change extends support to JMS providers that use the jakarta.jms namespace. For details on how this change may affect your tests and what steps to take, see Important Note for JMS Users: Transition to Jakarta JMS API in ReadyAPI.
  - Standardized ‘Add Test Step’ UI: To provide a consistent experience, we standardized the user interface for adding test steps across the application.
  - Extended mockResult to include Routed Response Data: In Virtual Service scripting, the mockResult object—available in the afterRequest script—now includes response data even when the response comes from a routed endpoint. Previously, mockResult only contained response details if the response came from a mock in the virtual service. This update gives you full access to routed response data, improving visibility and control when you enable routing. See the mockResult object description for more information.
  - Library Updates: ReadyAPI 3.61.0 includes newer versions of some libraries that version 3.60.0 used. If your scripts refer to classes from Libraries Updated in ReadyAPI 3.61.0, you might need to update the scripts.
  See Bug Fixes in ReadyAPI 3.61.0 for the list of fixes included in this patch.
