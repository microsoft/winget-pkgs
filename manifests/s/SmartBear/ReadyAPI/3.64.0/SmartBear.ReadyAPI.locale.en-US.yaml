ReleaseNotes: |-
  Important Notice for ReadyAPI Customers
  Starting from ReadyAPI 3.62.0, VirtServer 3.29.0, and TestEngine 1.34.0, SmartBear Product Family has fully deprecated file-based licenses and transitioned to the ID-based SmartBear License Management (SLM) system. Any customers still using file-based licenses must complete their migration to SLM by September 30, 2025.
  From October 1, 2025, existing and activated file-based licenses will continue to work for some time. However, SmartBear will no longer generate new file-based licenses or support activation and deactivation of file-based licenses in ReadyAPI, VirtServer, or TestEngine. All new and updated licenses are now issued in SLM only.
  All technical support for file-based licenses has now ceased, and SmartBear no longer maintains the file-based licensing system. Any access or service issues will result in service disruptions that we will not be able to restore.
  If you have not completed the process of migrating, contact your Account Manager or SmartBear representative today. Our teams are ready to assist with smooth transition strategies. For additional support, log a request with our SmartBear Support, who are standing by to help.
  For further information and timelines, refer to the File-Based License End-of-Life Policy page.

  ReadyAPI 3.64.0 includes a few changes that we are excited to share with you. See Version History for changes in previous releases.
  SmartBear AI-Assisted Test Generation [Beta]
  - SmartBear AI-Assisted Generation of Assertion-Complete Test Cases: Added support for generating rich, assertion-complete test cases directly from an API definition (for example, OAS 3.0) using natural-language queries powered by large language models. For details on using this capability, see Generate Tests with SmartBear AI [Beta] and SmartBear AI in ReadyAPI.
  Connectivity and Integration Enhancements
  - Enhanced Swagger Studio Integration for API Version Awareness: ReadyAPI now checks Swagger Studio for API version updates when your project includes tests linked to Swagger Studio definitions. The Notification Center displays alerts when a newer API version is available, allowing you to import the updated definition and refactor tests efficiently. For details, see Notifications for Updated API Versions and Notifications for Updated API Versions.
  Security Enhancements
  - Stronger Governance for Weak Cipher Usage: ReadyAPI now includes a setting that blocks weak ciphers to enforce stronger security governance. Client endpoints that rely on weak ciphers cannot connect when this setting is active. ReadyAPI also disallows several weak ciphers by default. For details, see System Requirements and Java Virtual Machine Parameters.
  Migration and Compatibility
  - Defined an Upgrade Path for Older Versions: Users upgrading from versions earlier than 3.51.0 must first upgrade to 3.63.0 before moving to the latest release. Because previous updates (including the removal of file-based licensing) already required upgrades to later versions, this change affects only a small set of users. Contact SmartBear Support if you need assistance.
  - Support for Adoptium JDK 21.0.9+10: ReadyAPI 3.64.0 now supports Adoptium JDK 21.0.9+10, ensuring compatibility with the latest Java runtime improvements and security updates. VirtServer and TestEngine adopt Java 21 in their Q1 releases.
  General Updates
  - Library Updates: ReadyAPI 3.64.0 includes newer versions of some libraries that version 3.63.0 used. If your scripts refer to classes from Libraries Updated in ReadyAPI 3.64.0, you may need to update the scripts.
  See Bug Fixes in ReadyAPI 3.64.0 for the list of fixes included in this patch.
