ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Support for ReadyAPI 3.59.0 and Partial OAS 3.1 Compatibility: VirtServer now supports ReadyAPI 3.59.0 projects, including partial support for OAS 3.1. Future updates to both ReadyAPI and VirtServer will further enhance OAS 3.1 compatibility.
  - End of Support for Maven Plugin: Maven plugin version 1.0.9 remains fully compatible with VirtServer 3.25.0 and aims to maintain compatibility with later releases. However, we no longer provide support for the Maven plugin and will not address any issues in future updates.
  - Improved Handling of Boolean and Numeric Values in Conditional Match: In ReadyAPI 3.59.0, we've introduced an option to automatically detect boolean and numeric values in Conditional Match responses and remove quotes around them. VirtServer now supports this feature. For more details, refer to the VirtServer Configuration table on the VirtServer Settings File page.
