ReleaseNotes: |-
  - ReadyAPI Compatibility: TestEngine 1.35.0 now fully supports ReadyAPI 3.65.0, ensuring seamless integration with the latest version.
  - Java 21 LTS Support: TestEngine now supports Java 21 LTS.
  - SLM Licensing and Data-Driven Tests (TSERV-2261 and TSERV-2288): Fixed an issue introduced in version 1.34.0 that prevented SLM licenses from running data-driven tests after the removal of file-based licensing. Data-driven tests now execute as expected with SLM licenses.
  - Database Growth and Runtime Exceptions (TSERV-2213): Fixed a memory leak that caused the testengine.mv.db file to grow excessively and trigger runtime exceptions. Updated the H2 configuration to improve memory management and prevent uncontrolled database growth.
