ReleaseNotes: |-
  - ReadyAPI Compatibility: TestEngine 1.34.0 now fully supports ReadyAPI 3.62.0, ensuring seamless integration with the latest version.
  - File-Based Licensing Support Removed: As outlined in our File-Based License End-of-Support Policy, ReadyAPI no longer supports Protection LS or file-based license types. ReadyAPI now supports only SmartBear License Management (SLM) licenses. The licensing code is updated accordingly.
  - SecurityManager Deprecation: TestEngine no longer supports Security Manager. You can now open any file or network socket permitted by your customer environment or network infrastructure. This enhancement simplifies workflows, reduces frustration, and lowers the number of support cases.
