ShortDescription: Freedom for your Windows 11 Clock
Description: |-
  Have a customizable clock on your Windows 11 taskbar.
  When Microsoft's engineers were creating Windows 11, they forgot to add a clock on the secondary screen taskbar.
   So I did that.
   ElevenClock is a simple app that provides the same functionality as in windows 10 secondary taskbar clock.
