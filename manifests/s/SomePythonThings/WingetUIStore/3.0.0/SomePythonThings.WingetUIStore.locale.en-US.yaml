  Changelog
  WingetUI has been redesigned entirely. WingetUI is now built with WinUI3 on top of .NET 8. This redesign brings not only a brand new interface, but also an improved backend. The major highlights are:
  - Smoother, more responsive interface. Aesthetics and accessibility have been greatly improved.
  - The backend has been improved. Packages now load faster and more reliably, providing a more straight-forward experience.
  - Importing and exporting packages got a big upgrade: Lists of packages can now be opened, edited and exported again. A new Package Bundles section has been added to the interface.
  WingetUI has been redesigned from scratch, therefore, this upgrade brings tons of other improvements and new features that are not going to be listed here. You can check the full changelog or download WingetUI 3.0.0 and start experiencing the best WingetUI ever right now
