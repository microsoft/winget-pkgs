ReleaseNotes: |-
  Changelog
  WingetUI has been redesigned entirely. WingetUI is now built with WinUI3 on top of .NET 8. This redesign brings not only a brand new interface, but also an improved backend. The major highlights are:
  - Smoother, more responsive interface.
    Aesthetics and accessibility have been greatly improved.
  - The backend has been improved.
    Packages now load faster and more reliably, providing a more straight-forward experience.
  - Importing and exporting packages got a big upgrade: Lists of packages can now be opened, edited and exported again.
    A new Package Bundles section has been added to the interface.
