ShortDescription: Hard kills programs similar to the task manager using Alt+F4. Useful for unstable programs. Not my property but has been brought here for your convienence.
ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Fixed keyboard input lag.
    Thanks to Victor Robertson (@vmrob).
  - Do not enter xkill mode if Ctrl key is pressed.
    Ctrl+Win+F4 is a new shortcut to close virtual desktops, so we don't want to prevent that.
    Thanks to Jos√© Rebelo (@joserebelo).
  - Add a process blacklist, with explorer.exe in the list by default.
