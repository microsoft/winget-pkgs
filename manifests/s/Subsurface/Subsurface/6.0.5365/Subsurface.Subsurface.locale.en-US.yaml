Description: Subsurface can plan and track single and multi-tank dives using air, Nitrox or TriMix. It allows tracking of dive locations including GPS coordinates (which can also conveniently be entered using a map interface), logging of equipment used and names of other divers, and lets users rate dives and provide additional notes. Subsurface also calculates a wide variety of statistics of the userâ€™s diving and tracks information like the SAC rate, partial pressures of O2, N2 and He, calculated deco information, and many more.
