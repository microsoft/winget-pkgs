  ## Fixed

  - Many fixes for the LSP plugin implementation which brings better general support to LSPs, which
    also fixes #694, #742 and #766.
    - Implemented workspace/didChangeConfiguration command in LSP client. Now it's possible to set LSP
      settings for this command (#694).
    - Prevent dead-locks in LSP very heavy usage scenarios
  - Many fixes to the terminal emulator (closes issues #740 and #800).
    - In TerminalEmulator allow to select text outside the visible range.
    - Fix minor bug when changing terminal font and creating a new terminal was still using the old font.
    - Terminal: multiple issues with the copy/paste operations fixed. Now uses the primary selection when
      corresponds (middle mouse click, shift+insert). Fixed paste operation, it does not hang the app,
      pastes instantly contents and behaves exactly the same as other terminals.
  - Many fixes in the DAP implementation.

  - Fix overlapping shortcuts and terminal shortcuts in terminal.
  - Take into account the line spacing to position the cursor.
  - Fix underline and strikethrough size when top and bottom positions are the same due to the small
    difference generated by the underline thickness (otherwise it was sometimes invisible).
  - Fix paste with middle-click in OSes with no primary selection.
  - Fix move event not being handled correctly within the FileSystemModel fileIsVisibleFn configuration
    (discussed at: SpartanJ/ecode/discussions#776).
