ReleaseNotes: |-
    This release fixes the problem people have been facing when trying to launch pineflash on wayland. If you don't care about the details then just update to the latest version and your problem should go away.
    
    For those of you interested in why it was happening it seemed to be a problem with the underlying code of the graphical toolkit I use (egui) so I had to do some refactoring due to some breaking changes in the library. Here's to hoping I haven't broken anything after doing that since I am currently away from any pinecils but as far as my testing goes it should be fine.
    
    Due to updating to the new version of egui I am having to drop rhel 9 support for now. I have been running into issues compiling on it so if you do run rhel 9 I would recommend trying the appimage.
