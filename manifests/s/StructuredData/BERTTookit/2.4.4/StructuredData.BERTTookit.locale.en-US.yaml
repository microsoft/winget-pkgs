ShortDescription: Basic Excel R Toolkit
Description: |-
  BERT is a tool for connecting Excel with the statistics language R. Specifically, it’s designed to support running R functions from Excel spreadsheet cells. In Excel terms, it’s for writing User-Defined Functions (UDFs) in R.
  All you have to do is write the function. Everything else – loading the function into Excel, managing parameters, and handling type conversion – is done automatically for you. It really could not be any easier.
  BERT also has a console that you can use to control Excel in real time, right from your R code. And (if you want), you can call R functions from VBA as well.
