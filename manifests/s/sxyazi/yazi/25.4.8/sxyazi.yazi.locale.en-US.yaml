ReleaseNotes: |-
  Breaking Changes
  - Supported wraparound navigation and enabled it by default. #2485
  - Replaced tasks_show and close_input with tasks:show and input:close. #2530
  - frag, name, stem, ext, and parent on Url, name on tab::Tab, and is_hovered on fs::File are now properties. #2572
  - Swapped the default key bindings for z (zoxide) and Z (fzf). #2546
  - Used the new @sync peek annotation instead of the previewer's sync = true. #2487
  Deprecated
  - ui.Padding and ui.Rect:padding() are deprecated. #2574
  Packaging
  - SVG preview backend switched from ImageMagick to resvg and implemented as a new svg previewer. #2533, #2581
  Custom Search Engine Lua API
  With #2452, you can create custom search engines via the Lua API, meaning that plugins can serve as the source for search view file lists.
  A new plugin vcs-files.yazi is available to display the list of files changed in Git within Yazi:

  Platform-Specific Key Binding
  #2526 adds a new optional for field to key bindings to specify the platform the key binding applies to.
  For example:
  { on = [ 'g', 'd' ], run = 'cd ~/dev',  desc = 'Go dev',    for = 'unix' },
  { on = [ 'g', 'd' ], run = 'cd C:\dev', desc = 'Go C:\dev', for = 'windows' },
  Performance Improvements
  This version brings several performance enhancements:
  - Configuration parser has been rewritten to double the startup speed. #2508
  - AVIF, HEIF, and JPEG XL previews have seen significant performance improvements. #2533, thanks @ze0987
  - Compiled and cached the Lua bytecode to enhance the overall performance of the plugin system. #2490
  Enhance fzf Integration
  Now, you can select multiple files in fzf, and the selected files will also be selected in Yazi.
  Also, you can now view, navigate, and deselect the file selection list from Yazi within fzf.

  See #2546 for more details.
  Use Yazi File Manager Directly in Helix, Without Zellij or tmux
  #2461 adapted Yazi to support Helix's :insert-output, which means you can now run Yazi directly within Helix â€“ it even supports image and video previews!

  New prev and next Arguments to arrow for Wraparound Navigation
  Circular navigation is one of the long-requested features, and is now supported via the new arrow prev and arrow next commands in #2485.
  New follow Command to Follow Files Pointed to by Symlinks
  #2543 adds support for following files pointed to by symlinks.
  A new key binding, g => f (follow hovered symlink), has been added to use this feature.
  Allow Initializing Input When Opening It with Commands Like rename, create, find, filter, etc.
  With #2578, you can now customize the input box opened by commands such as create, rename, cd, filter, find, search, and shell. For example:
  { on = "r", run = [ "rename", "input:escape" ] }
  This will open the rename input box and exit insert mode, meaning that the default state will be normal mode.
