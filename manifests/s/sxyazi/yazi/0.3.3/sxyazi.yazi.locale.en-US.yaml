ReleaseNotes: |-
  This version fixes a regression from the previous release that caused some keys to stop working. And it resolves a long-standing issue where the file list couldn't refresh automatically in Windows WSL.This version also introduces the following three new features:Git integration
  Show the status of Git file changes as a linemode in the file list.Feel free to use it and report any issues! For now, you need to manually install it (pretty easy to do) from  In the future, it will be included as one of Yazi's built-in plugins.size linemode supports displaying the number of files in a directory
  #1591 updates the size linemode for directories to support displaying the number of files within the directory instead of leaving it blank as before.If size information is available for the directory (triggered when sorting by size), that information will be shown as a priority.Windows Terminal support for image previews
  Windows Terminal Preview v1.22.2362.0 now supports the Sixel image format. Yazi provided an adaptation for this in #1588 (Thanks @e82eric).Note that Windows Terminal Preview v1.22.2362.0 has a bug that can cause Yazi to time out at startup.
