ReleaseNotes: |-
  This is a quick patch release with 3 fixes:
  - Fixed an issue where switching directories in Yazi didn't update the CWD, causing issues with features that depend on the CWD (like terminal splitting and cd --interactive path completion).
  - Fixed a bug where the UI wouldn't refresh when returning to Yazi from an external blocking process (like a shell) while in an empty directory.
  - Fixed an issue where the preview wouldn't update after sorting directories when using the Folder-specific rules tip.
  Here are some new features:
  - Added support for a large number of new archive formats for extraction, previewing, and filetype highlighting in #1926 (thanks to @Integral-Tech).
  - Added a new temporary option _v4_suppress_deprecation_warnings in #2027 to suppress all deprecation warnings as a workaround for the transition to version 0.4:
  # yazi.toml
  [manager]
  _v4_suppress_deprecation_warnings = true


  - Added 2 new Lua APIs
      - fs.cwd() - get the current working directory
      - fs.create() - create a directory
