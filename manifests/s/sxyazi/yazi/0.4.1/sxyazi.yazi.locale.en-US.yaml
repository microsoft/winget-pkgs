ReleaseNotes: |-
  This is a quick patch version with 4 fixes:
  - Fixed an issue where Yazi would freeze when waiting for terminal response, in old tmux versions (v3.2a or lower), or 2-layer nested terminal setup (tmux -> Neovim's :terminal -> Yazi).
  - Fixed a bug in the Überzug++ backend where certain image dimension parsing failed, preventing images from displaying.
  - Fixed a build failure for Android 32-bit architectures.
  - Fixed an issue with the preset archive and json plugins not handling CRLF properly on Windows.
  What's Changed
  - fix: disable passthrough when the user launches Yazi in Neovim inside tmux by @sxyazi in #2014
  - refactor: replace format! with concat! for string literals by @Integral-Tech in #2012
  - fix: correctly handle CRLF on Windows in preset archive and json plugins by @sxyazi in #2017
  - fix: failed to parse certain image dimensions for Überzug++ backend by @sxyazi in #2020
