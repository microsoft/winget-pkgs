ReleaseNotes: |-
  This is a quick fix release that addresses a few issues introduced in the previous version 25.2.7.
  Besides that, a new overall option has been added under [status] in theme.toml, which allows you to set the overall style of the status bar, specifically the empty area in the center:
  [status]
  overall = { fg = "#cad3f5", bg = "#181926" }
  411906568-4ab46d09-9f2c-489b-85f3-83f264ecd9cc
