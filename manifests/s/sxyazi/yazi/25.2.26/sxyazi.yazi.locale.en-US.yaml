ReleaseNotes: |-
  Breaking Changes
  - The [completion] component has been renamed to [cmp]. #2399
  Deprecated
  - MANAGER, PREVIEW, PLUGIN, and THEME have been deprecated in favor of the new rt and th. #2389
  - ya.manager_emit() has been deprecated in favor of the new ya.mgr_emit(). #2397
  Built-in Previewer Improvements
  - The JSON previewer will now respect the user's wrap setting to support automatic JSON line wrapping. #2337, thanks @boydaihungst
  - The PDF previewer will now respect the user's max_width setting to address the issue of previewing content that is too small. #2331
  - The ImageMagick previewer will now respect the user's image_alloc setting to limit memory usage. #2403
  New Search Engine: rga
  #2383 (thanks @paperbenni) has added a new ripgrep-all search engine.
  It is a wrapper around ripgrep that supports additional file formats (such as PDF, docx, epub, etc.).
  You can use it with the search --via=rga command.
  Allow to Specify Layer for Keymap Commands
  With #2399, you'll now be able to assign commands from different layers to a keybinding in keymap.toml.
  This opens up the possibility of interacting with any other component, such as accessing commands from the manager ([manager]) within the input component ([input]):
  [[input.prepend_keymap]]
  on   = "<Esc>"
  run  = [ "close", "mgr:escape --filter" ]
  desc = "Close input and cancel the filter"
  When you press Esc in the input box to exit the filter view (triggered by the f key), the filter will be canceled as the input is closed.
  More Flexible Status Bar Customization
  #2313 (thanks @PFiS1737) introduces sep_left and sep_right to replace the previous separator_open and separator_close settings, allowing different separators to be set for the left and right sides:
  status-sep-explain
  Support for Setting Spotter Table Styles
  #2391 introduces two new settings, tbl_col and tbl_cell, in theme.toml to configure the styles for table columns and cells respectively.
