ShortDescription: An unofficial desktop client for ProtonMail done with electron nativefier
Description: |-
  An unofficial desktop client for ProtonMail done with electron nativefier.
  I just did it because I didnt want to open the browser every time I wanted to check my protonmail, I dont like to use Proton Bridge which is buggy and I prefer to access protonmail without an intermediary software while keeping desktop notifications and a dedicated app.
