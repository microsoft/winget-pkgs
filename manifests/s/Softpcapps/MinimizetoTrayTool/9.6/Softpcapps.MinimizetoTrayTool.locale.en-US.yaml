ShortDescription: Minimize to the Windows tray or maximize always any application.
Description: MinimizeToTrayTool is a utility that allows the user to minimize any application to the windows tray. Unlike similar applications, it is not necessary to explicitly tell the application each time you want to minimize to the tray a specific application but it is only necessary to specify the application's filename and then the application will be minimized automatically to the windows tray each time the user minimizes it.
