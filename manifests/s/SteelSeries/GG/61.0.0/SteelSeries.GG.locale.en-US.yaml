ReleaseNotes: |-
  Sonar
  - We've been on a bug-busting mission.
    First things first, let's talk about that pesky bug in GG 60.0/60.1.
    Some of you experienced an issue where your audio devices would switch every time your PC went to sleep or restarted.
    We heard your feedback loud and clear.
    We're really sorry for the inconvenience and the potential mix-up during your gaming sessions.
    We've been working hard to squash these bugs.

    So, what's the fix? We've released an update that puts an end to all the issues.
    No more unexpected device swaps and no more excluded devices joining the party uninvited.
    To help you understand the magic behind the scenes, we've put together a detailed FAQ.
    That's your golden ticket to understanding how the Backup device switch works in Sonar.
    Knowledge is power, and we want you to have all the power!

  - And because we love to keep the good times rolling, we're also dropping some fresh Game presets to enhance your audio experience.
    Get ready to immerse yourself in the worlds of Fallout 76, Content Warning, Path of Exile, Farlight 84, Vampire the Masquerade, and Star Citizen with tailor-made EQ settings that will make your ears feel like they're in audio heaven!

  Engine
  - Minor bug fixes
  - Fixed an issue where Engine Gear tab would not load without internet connection in certain conditions.

  Moments
  - Moments now supports auto-clipping for Helldivers 2!
    Auto-clipping will be triggered for killstreaks at x20, x50, and x100, if you're a killing machine.
    It will also trigger when you get eliminated, because those moments can be memorable too.
  - We've fixed and updated some events related to other supported auto-clipping games such as Fortnite headshots (Chapter 5 Season 2).
  - We've removed the â€˜Elevated Capture' option, as it was no longer useful based on the latest updates to the Moments Capture Engine
  - We've fixed minor issues related to Screenshot Extractor functionality.

  3D Aim Trainer
  - Introducing the new and improved player interface in the game lobby.
    Get ready to level up your gaming experience!
  - Discover stunning new badges and showcase your assessment!
  - Play new, exciting casual play levels!
