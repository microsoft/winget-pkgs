ShortDescription: Xperia Companion offers an easy way to perform a software repair.
Description: |-
  Software repair will reset your device and reinstall the system software. This can be useful if you experience severe problems with your device.
  Software repair will erase all user data on your device. Files on the external storage (SD™ card) will not be deleted.
  You may need to unlock your device using your Google™ account if theft protection is enabled. Please make sure you know your Google™ account details before you start a software repair.
  The software will be downloaded to your computer and, once the download is complete, the device can be repaired. A step-by-step guide will take you through the whole process.
  It is strongly recommended to keep your computer plugged into a power source while repairing.
  Your device should be connected to the computer during the repair.
  You will not be able to use your phone during the repair, not even for emergency calls.
