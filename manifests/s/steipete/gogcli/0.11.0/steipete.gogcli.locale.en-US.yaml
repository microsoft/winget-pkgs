ReleaseNotes: |-
  0.11.0
  Added
  - Apps Script: add appscript command group (create/get projects, fetch content, run deployed functions).
  - Forms: add forms command group (create/get forms, list/get responses).
  - Docs: add docs comments for listing and managing Google Doc comments. (#263) — thanks @alextnetto.
  - Sheets: add sheets notes to read cell notes. (#208) — thanks @andybergon.
  - Gmail: add gmail send --quote to include quoted original message in replies. (#169) — thanks @terry-li-hm.
  - Drive: add drive ls|search --no-all-drives to restrict queries to "My Drive" for faster/narrower results. (#258)
  - Contacts: update contacts from JSON via contacts update --from-file (PR #200 — thanks @jrossi).
  Fixed
  - Drive: make drive delete move files to trash by default; add --permanent for irreversible deletion. (#262) — thanks @laihenyi.
  - Drive/Gmail: pass through Drive API filter queries in drive search; RFC 2047-encode non-ASCII display names in mail headers (From/To/Cc/Bcc/Reply-To). (#260) — thanks @salmonumbrella.
  - Calendar: allow opting into attendee notifications for updates and cancellations via calendar update|delete --send-updates all|externalOnly|none. (#163) — thanks @tonimelisma.
  - Calendar: fall back to fixed-offset timezones (Etc/GMT±N) for recurring events when given RFC3339 offset datetimes; harden Gmail attachment output paths and cache validation; honor proxy defaults for Google API transports. (#228) — thanks @salmonumbrella.
  - Auth: manual OAuth flow uses an ephemeral loopback redirect port (avoids unsafe/privileged ports in browsers). (#172) — thanks @spookyuser.
  - Gmail: include primary display name in gmail send From header when using service account impersonation (domain-wide delegation). (#184) — thanks @salmonumbrella.
  - Gmail: when gmail attachment --out points to a directory (or ends with a trailing slash), combine with --name and avoid false cache hits on directories. (#248) — thanks @zerone0x.
  - Drive: include shared drives in drive ls and drive search; reject drive download --format for non-Google Workspace files. (#256) — thanks @salmonumbrella.
  - Drive: validate drive download --format values and error early for unknown formats. (#259)
