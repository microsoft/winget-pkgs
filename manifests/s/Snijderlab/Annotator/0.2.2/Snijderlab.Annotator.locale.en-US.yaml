ShortDescription: Discover the depths of your spectra one spectrum at a time
Description: A simple tool to help you manually discover the depths of your spectra one spectrum at a time. It can load MGF files (only in centroid mode, also do not forget to deconvolute if you have TD data). Once loaded you can select a scan and add you annotation while tweaking the exact settings for generating the annotation. The annotation itself is interactive to help you discover what the spectrum means. Which you can then export as nice images for use in other environments.
