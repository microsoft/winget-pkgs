ShortDescription: Discover the depths of your spectra one spectrum at a time
Description: A simple tool to help you manually discover the depths of your spectra one spectrum at a time. It can load MGF files (only in centroid mode, also do not forget to deconvolute if you have TD data). Once loaded you can select a scan and add you annotation while tweaking the exact settings for generating the annotation. The annotation itself is interactive to help you discover what the spectrum means. Which you can then export as nice images for use in other environments.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Added glycan visualisations both full structures and fragments, in the spectrum, on peptides, and when searching / displaying modifications
  - Custom models can be saved (and backed up and shared between machines)
  - Added support for a basic CSV file to open as identified peptide (needing 'scan_index', 'z', 'raw_file', 'sequence', and possibly 'mode' as columns)
  - Added support for more complex fragmentation model
    - Added amino acid specific neutral losses to peptide fragments
    - Added side chain losses from peptide fragments
    - Added variant ions, where ions lose or gain hydrogen, zÂ· means z + H, z' means z - H
    - Added control over glycan fragments on peptide fragments
    - Added control to neutral losses of glycan diagnostic ions and immonium ions
    - Added satellite ions distant from the parent breakage, nw indicates a w ion where the nth side chain (starting at 0) from the parent z ion fragments off
  - MS2 annotations are ordered on crude likelihood
  - General bug fixes, amongst others fixed high memory usage on merging spectra
  - Added the manual in the Annotator to make it easy to find
