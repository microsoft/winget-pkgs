ShortDescription: Discover the depths of your spectra one spectrum at a time
Description: A simple tool to help you manually discover the depths of your spectra one spectrum at a time. It can load MGF files (only in centroid mode, also do not forget to deconvolute if you have TD data). Once loaded you can select a scan and add you annotation while tweaking the exact settings for generating the annotation. The annotation itself is interactive to help you discover what the spectrum means. Which you can then export as nice images for use in other environments.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Fixed manual not opening & updated manual
  - Fixed links to open in the default browser
  - Fixed some identified peptidoform issues (amongst other handle MSFragger files with missing columns)
  - Fixed custom modification neutral losses not being shown (they were always applied)
  - Fixed EAD glycan fragmentation
  - Fixed custom glycan peptide fragments not being saved
  - Improved peptide search speed, first search still takes a while but every subsequent search will be a lot quicker
  - Improved handling of error in custom modifications and models files (errors are shown at the top of the list)
  - Added support for PEAKS v13 Dia de novo
  - Added support for factors for neutral losses (-2H2O instead of -H4O2)
  - Added support for neutral losses from cross-linkers
  Because of these last two the custom modifications and models JSON files have changed. The old files will still be read fine, but once edited the files will change to the updated JSON format. This is the reason why this update is listed as a minor release.
