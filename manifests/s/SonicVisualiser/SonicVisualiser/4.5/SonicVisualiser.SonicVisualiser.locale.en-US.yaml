ReleaseNotes: |-
  • Add option to switch off the interpolation used in the waveform
    view for zoom levels closer than one pixel per frame: sometimes it
    can be an unnecessary distraction. With interpolation switched off,
    the individual samples are shown as unconnected points instead

  • Make it possible to toggle segment colouring in the segmentation
    view of the time value layer, as well as toggling segment division
    lines

  • When importing CSV files, if a column heading indicates a likely
    unit for the column, use it by default; also remember last user
    settings for the import dialog

  • Ensure the Choose Default Template option on the templates menu can
    be reached even when no file is loaded

  • Give the spectrum layer the same effective scale range as it had
    before the dB scale fix in v4.4, fixing the accidental halving of
    the visible range for that layer in v4.4

  • Fix hang when opening two plugin parameter dialogs at once

  • Fix crash when rendering slice or spectrum layers scrolled to
    earlier than the start of the audio or later than the end

  • Fix crash when more than one audio file is supplied at the command
    line with a default session template that requires regenerating one
    or more feature extraction layers and layer generation produces an
    error or warning

  • Fix failure to exit fully if the window is closed before plugin
    scan is complete at startup
