  Release Notes for the BarTender 11.5.0 Release
  Customer-reported issues and features that were added or improved in BarTender® are listed below.
  July 7, 2025
  New Features
  - Printer Warnings Enhanced. The printer notification system has been enhanced to provide clearer warnings when adding a printer will cause the number of printers to exceed the subscription limit.
  - Enhanced Notifications for Expiring Subscription. The subscription notification system has been enhanced to provide earlier warnings, clearer renewal instructions, and expanded support for API users. These updates help ensure uninterrupted access and improve user awareness. Notifications now display 60 days prior to the expiration of a subscription.
  - Print Engine Optimized. BarTender's print engine has been modified so that when scanning an S3 folder for file integration, performance is improved. Printing workflow now bypasses initializing forms if the document does not contain any, and redirect settings are only read when the file is changed. Users should notice smoother printing experience.
  - Selecting a Record Process Updated. The Print button in BarTender's Print Portal is now unavailable until at least one record has been selected. This mirrors the how records are printed in the Designer.
  - Download Page Now Includes Full Version Information. The BarTender Downloads page now includes the full release number (e.g., 11.4.1) alongside the version (e.g., BarTender 11.4). This update reduces version ambiguity for users, and ensures users are always downloading the most recent and stable release.
  Minor Fixes
  - When editing existing BarTender documents that include Seagull Fonts, these fonts now display correctly no matter how the document is opened, whether from within BarTender Designer or using File Explorer.
  - A text object's error handling settings are now correctly enacted should the print job encounter an error when printing a document containing a text object through the Integration Building.
  - When creating a new document based on an existing BarTender document, the existing document now opens successfully as a template for the new document, rather than being deleted.
  - The search bar in the drop-down record picker in Print Station now automatically contains the focus, enabling the user to simply start typing to find the records they need rather than first clicking the search bar to set the focus there.
  - GHS pictograms now render correctly when printing the GHS_Less_Than_500_Liters.btw template using BarTender's native PDF driver.
  - When using a complex label (e.g., with 100+ database fields, a query prompt, 12 layers with 6 conditionally printed layers, data entry, VB Scripting, and multiple templates) in Print Portal or Designer, the user no longer sees instability and significant slow downs.
  - In BarTender Designer, when printing a label with multiple records from Print Preview, the Select Records dialog no longer displays twice. The user now only needs to select the records to print once.
  - The Designer now correctly identifies the different revisions of a BarTender label, no longer designating all open versions with the revision number of the first file opened in Designer.
  - When printing a label with an active database and clearing the Use Database option in the Record Selection section of the Print dialog, the Use Database checkbox remains cleared after opening the Print Quality Options dialog from the Copies field.
  - When using Print Preview with a BarTender document that is connected to a database, the preview now displays the correct data selected from the Select Records dialog or the Record Picker Control.
  - Exporting the image of a template in Designer where the file contains at least one period (.) and the file extension is missing no longer displays an error.
  - Printing a label that has a text object linked with a data entry form where the "Update sample data after print" checkbox is selected causes the sample data to update correctly after the print run when the print station is set to never save after printing.
  - Navigating to any folder in the Print Portal, then clicking the browser's Back button to return to a previous folder no longer causes the Print Portal to load endlessly.
  - Printing large batches (9000 or more jobs) no longer causes the preview to become unresponsive resulting in longer print times.
