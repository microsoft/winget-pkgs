ReleaseNotes: |-
  Quality of chess play:
    In our testing against its predecessor, Stockfish 16.1 shows a notable improvement in performance, with an Elo gain of up to 27 points and winning over 2 times more game pairs than it loses.
  Improved evaluation:
  - Updated neural network architecture: The neural network architecture has undergone two updates and is currently in its 8th version.
  - Removal of handcrafted evaluation (HCE): This release marks the removal of the traditional handcrafted evaluation and the transition to a fully neural network-based approach.
  - Dual NNUE: For the first time, Stockfish includes a secondary neural network, used to quickly evaluate positions that are easily decided.
  UCI Options removed:
    Use NNUE and UCI_AnalyseMode have been removed as they no longer had any effect. SlowMover has also been removed in favor of Move Overhead.
  More binaries:
  We now offer 13 new binaries. These new binaries include avx512, vnni256, vnni512, m1-apple-silicon, and armv8-dotprod, which take advantage of specific CPU instructions for improved performance.
  For most users, using sse41-popcnt (formerly modern), avx2, or bmi2 should be enough, but if your CPU supports these new instructions, feel free to try them!
  Development changes:
  - Updated testing book: This new book, now derived exclusively from the open Lichess database, is 10 times larger than its predecessor, and has been used to test potential improvements to Stockfish over the past few months.
  - Consolidation of repositories: Aiming to simplify access to our resources, we have moved most Stockfish-related repositories into the official Stockfish organization on GitHub.
  - Growing maintainer team: We welcome Disservin to the team of maintainers of the project! This extra pair of hands will ensure the lasting success of Stockfish.
