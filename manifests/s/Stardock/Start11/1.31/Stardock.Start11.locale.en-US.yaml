ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Right-click on the left side of centered taskbars when the enhanced taskbar is enabled now correctly shows the menu on secondary monitors
  - Fixed issue with closing one item from the thumbnail popup from the taskbar in enhanced mode making the popup window jump to the far left of the screen sometimes
  - The line on 22H2 taskbars now adjusts with the alpha set on the taskbar by the user and is hidden entirely when the taskbar is on top. You can also create a registry key in the usual location of type string and give it a value of "1" and a name of "HideTaskbarLineEntirely" should you wish to always hide the line entirely.
  - Fixed mouseover pinned item tooltip moving away sometimes when leaving the taskbar
  - Fences items in Win11 menu mode will now save their order. Note that no gaps are saved in Win11-style menus only the order is
  - Tweak to refreshing apps list when new apps are installed as the search did not always refresh correctly for the newly installed application
  - Native Windows 11 will now center exactly vs in line with the start button when Start11 enhances the taskbar and had a centered start button. You can also create a registry key in the usual location of type string and give it a value of "1" and a name of "ForceWin11MenuToOffset" should you wish to line up with the start button as it did in 1.3
  - Fixed an issue with the taskbar on top having a gap at the bottom of the screen that maximized windows did not use when using the enhanced taskbar
  - Fixed issue with taskbar clock on primary monitor not showing up with enhanced taskbar enabled sometimes initially until a resize or click on the more system icons button
  - Fixed issue with the desktop area (that maximized windows use) not being correct after some screen resolution/display config changes
  - Fix for secondary taskbar buttons on occasion overlapping the Win11 widgets/teams/search icons when using center mode with Start11 enhancing the taskbar
  - Adds in the messaging about center mode needing the enhanced taskbar option on to function.
  - Added the two strings to the en and en-us lng files
  - Fixed an issue where some Win10 \ 11 PCs would not show 'sleep' in Start11.
  - Update translation strings
