Description: |-
  Streamlink is a command-line utility which pipes video streams from various services into a video player, such as VLC or mpv. The main purpose of Streamlink is to avoid resource-heavy and unoptimized websites, while still allowing the user to enjoy various streamed content. There is also a Python API available for developers who want access to the stream data.
  
  This project was forked from Livestreamer, which is no longer maintained.
