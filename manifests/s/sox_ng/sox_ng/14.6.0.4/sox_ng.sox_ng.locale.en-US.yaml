ShortDescription: sox_ng is another Swiss Army Knife of sound processing utilities.
Description: >
  The SoX_ng project imports, compares and refines bug fixes and new work from
  the 50-odd software distributions that package SoX and from the plethora of
  forks on github and elsewhere and makes regular releases with a six-monthly
  cadence for each of the micro (bug fixes) and minor (new features) releases. A
  major release (non-backwards-compatible changes) is not planned.
