  Future
  Scribus 1.7.x is the new unstable series. While we will maintain Scribus 1.6.x as a stable version, most development will focus on 1.7.x and features and Qt6-based enhancements. 1.7.0.svn is developing relatively quickly with the integration of a new palette and docking system, new SVG based icons and many more features.
  We will look to update documentation in future 1.6.x releases and hope to launch a community documentation project in the future.
  We have no plans to fix issues in the 1.4.x branch of Scribus. No versions have been released for some time and the 1.6.x series is the stable series going forward. All branches are available in subversion (svn://scribus.net) as well as on our downloads links for all previously release versions. We encourage all Linux and *BSD distributions to switch their stable version to 1.6.x.
