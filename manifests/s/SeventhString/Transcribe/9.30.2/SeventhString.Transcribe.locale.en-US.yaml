ShortDescription: Software to help transcribe recorded music
Description: |-
  The Transcribe! application is an assistant for people who want to work out a piece of music from a recording, in order to write it out, or play it themselves, or both.
  It doesn't do the transcribing for you, but it is essentially a specialised player program which is optimised for the purpose of transcription.
  It has many transcription-specific features not found on conventional music players.
