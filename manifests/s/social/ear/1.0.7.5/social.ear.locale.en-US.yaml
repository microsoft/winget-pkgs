ShortDescription: Client of the specialized social network "Ear"
Description: "Everyone knows that an ordinary person draws the lion's share of information from the outside world through visual perception. Also, everyone knows about the existence of unusual people with partially or completely absent vision, who take the same information only through tactile sensations and hearing. The application «Ear» can become a bridge for you, connecting the worlds of sighted and blind people. It was developed by a completely blind programmer for everyone, everyone, everyone. Let's work together, create and have fun... Let's not only listen, but also hear each other... Functionality implemented now: Internet Radio with more than 8000 radio stations from all over the world, sorted by category. Text and voice chats, including anonymous ones, in which participants hide behind names they have invented. Board, logic and card offline and online games: «Checkers», «Chess», «Corners», «Mile-by-Mile», «Schotten-Totten», «Thousand», «Preference» and many others. An extension to the REAPER Audio studio for blind musicians (designed for PC only). Many other useful tools are being prepared to brighten up, diversify and facilitate the life of blind people around the world. Our app is available on 2 platforms (Android, Windows) and 100 languages (including English)."
