Description: The smartmontools package contains two utility programs (smartctl and smartd) to control and monitor storage systems using the Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology System (SMART) built into most modern ATA/SATA, SCSI/SAS and NVMe disks. In many cases, these utilities will provide advanced warning of disk degradation and failure. Smartmontools was originally derived from the Linux â€‹smartsuite package and actually supports ATA/SATA, SCSI/SAS and NVMe disks and also SCSI/SAS tape devices. It should run on any modern Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Darwin (macOS), Solaris, Windows, Cygwin, OS/2, eComStation or QNX system. Smartmontools can also be run from one of many different Live CDs/DVDs.
