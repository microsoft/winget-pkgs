ShortDescription: smartmontools contains utility programs (smartctl, smartd) to control/monitor storage systems using the Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology System (S.M.A.R.T.) built into most modern ATA and SCSI disks. It is derived from smartsuite.
Description: |-
  The smartmontools package contains two utility programs (smartctl and smartd) to control and monitor storage systems using the Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology System (SMART) built into most modern ATA/SATA, SCSI/SAS and NVMe disks.
  In many cases, these utilities will provide advanced warning of disk degradation and failure.
  Smartmontools was originally derived from the Linux â€‹smartsuite package and actually supports ATA/SATA, SCSI/SAS and NVMe disks and also SCSI/SAS tape devices.
  It should run on any modern Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Darwin (macOS), Solaris, Windows, Cygwin, OS/2, eComStation or QNX system.
  Smartmontools can also be run from one of many different Live CDs/DVDs.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  - CI and release builds are now reproducible if same SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH,
    build recipes and toolchains are used.
  - smartctl -j -A: New JSON value 'endurance_used' (ATA/SCSI/NVMe).
  - smartctl -j -A: New JSON value 'spare_available' (ATA/NVMe).
  - smartctl -j -i: Re-added the JSON value 'model_name' also for SCSI
    devices (regression).
  - smartctl -j -c: NVMe support.
  - smartctl -j -n ...: New JSON values 'power_mode.*' (ATA only).
  - smartctl -H -A: Support for NVMe SMART/Health Information per
    namespace.
  - smartctl -i: ATA ACS-6 updates.
  - smartctl -x: No longer includes -g wcreorder.
  - smartctl -x, -l scterc: No longer returns exit status 4 if SCT ERC
    is not supported by the device.
  - smartctl -l error: No longer prints bogus ATA error log entries if
    the error index is nonzero but the error count is zero.
  - smartctl -l ssd: Fixed corruption of the output of the SCSI Format
    Status log page.
  - smartctl -l ssd: Now detects 'no format since manufacture' from the
    SCSI Format Status log page.
  - smartctl -l farm: Fixed the unit of 'Write Power On' time.
  - smartctl -l farm: Fixed the byte order of ATA 'Assembly Date'.
  - smartctl -l farm: Fixed a possible segfault.
  - smartctl -l farm -q noserial: Suppresses serial and WWN also from FARM.
  - smartctl -l farm -T permissive: Overrides false negative FARM support
    check for rebranded drives.
  - smartctl -t TEST: Fixed self-tests of single namespace NVMe devices.
  - smartd -A: NVMe attribute log support.
  - smartd: Ignores NSID in duplicate check of single namespace devices.
  - smartd: No longer issues LOG_CRIT warnings for 'Set Feature' related
    NVMe error information log entries.
  - smartd: No longer hangs on systems with large file descriptor limits.
  - smartd: No longer logs invalid "old test ... not run" messages if
    staggered self-tests are used.
  - smartd.conf -l selftest[sts] -s ...: NVMe self-test support.
  - smartd.conf -H MASK: Ability to ignore specific bits of NVMe
    SMART/Health value 'Critical Warning'.
  - smartd.conf -p: Checks NVMe SMART/Health value 'Available Spare'.
  - smartd.conf -u [-f]: Checks NVMe SMART/Health values 'Percentage Used'
    and 'Media and Data Integrity Errors'.
  - smartd.conf -W ...: No longer includes individual sensors in NVMe
    temperature check as some devices report other values there.
  - ATA: Device type -d jmb39x-q2,N for another JMB39x protocol variant
    used by QNAP-TR002 NAS devices.
  - SCSI: Fixed range checks of mode page offset and VPD inquiry.
  - SCSI: Fixed buffer overflow parsing of VPD page.
  - SCSI: Fixed handling of multiple designators in VPD page.
  - USB/NVMe: -d sntjmicron no longer triggers USB resets on queries of
    the self-test log.
  - USB/NVMe: -d sntasmedia now supports log pages > 512 bytes.
  - USB/NVMe/SAT: New experimental NVMe/SAT autodetection options
    -d snt*/sat.
  - Fixed segfault on missing option argument on systems using musl libc.
  - HDD, SSD and USB additions to drive database.
  - automake < 1.13 are no longer supported.
  - Custom make rules are now silenced if make V=0 is used.
  - Enhanced makefile targets dist-* to create reproducible source
    tarballs if SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH is set.
  - The makefile no longer uses GNU make specific syntax elements
    (exception: reproducible builds for macOS).
  - Dropped support for platforms without sigaction().
  - configure: Now also detects MidnightBSD.
  - configure: Dropped option --with-signal-func.
  - configure: Default for --with-nvme-devicescan is now 'yes' also on
    NetBSD.
  - Version information is now also set if build from GH R/O mirror.
  - Linux: smartd.service now avoids a warning about an unset environment
    variable.
  - Linux: Dropped autodetection of deprecated device type -d marvell.
  - macOS: Support for reproducible builds of the DMG image.
  - OpenBSD: NVMe support.
  - Windows: Increased WMI timeout.
  - Windows: Support for reproducible builds of the installer.
  - Windows: Uninstaller is no longer damaged if the installer is signed.
  - Windows update-smartd-drivedb.ps1: Fixed call of gpg.exe if it
    appears more than once in the PATH.
