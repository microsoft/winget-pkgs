ShortDescription: GKrellM system monitoring tool built for Windows
Description: |-
  GKrellM is a single process stack of system monitors which supports applying themes to match its
  appearance to your desktop. Originally written for Unix systems, GKrellM was initially ported to
  Windows by Bill Nalens but the port did not see further updates after the year 2002. Because I
  found myself using GKrellM for remote-monitoring and always have been a huge fan of this helpful
  tool I decided to get it running on Windows again.
