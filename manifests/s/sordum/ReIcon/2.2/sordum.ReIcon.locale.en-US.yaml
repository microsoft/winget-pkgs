Description: |-
  ReIcon is portable freeware that enables you to save and restore your desktop icon layout. If you frequently change your screen resolution (e.g. to play games or use applications that require a specific resolution), you are probably  familiar with the problem of your desktop icons being jumbled into a mess after you switch back to your normal resolution. ReIcon solves this problem by allowing you to save your desktop icon layout and restore it later with the click of a button (or with the right-click context menu).

  ReIcon is very easy to use. Set your icons the way you like them, save the layout, then restore this layout later when the need arises.
