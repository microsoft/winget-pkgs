ShortDescription: FolderPainter is a freeware that lets you color your Windows explorer folder color and change it from the default yellow color.
Description: |-
  All of us want our computer to be well organized, as it would be easier to access your files and folders when you need it. Apart from organizing your files using separate folders for different kind of files, you can also customize the folder itself. One of the pertinent issues that most of us come across often is that we just can’t instantly seem to locate the folder we need because all of them look the same. We then resort to searching for its name or taking a more closer look. This can be taken care of if we could add different colors to the folders in Windows Explorer . If you can assign a different color to different folders, then it would become easier to access them next time. After all, recognizing a folder with a color would be much easier than going through the names of the folder.

  Windows 10 doesn’t have any options for you to customize folder colors. FolderPainter is a freeware that lets you color your Windows explorer folder color and change it from the default yellow color. Using this application, you can assign any color to your frequently accessed folders for example your financial folder can be green (like money) and your tasks folder can be red (urgent maybe?). After that No longer will you have to run your eyes over many folders to access your favorite folder. Having a different color will make the folder stand out, so that you can open it quickly.
