ShortDescription: A command-line tool for Snowflake developers to create, manage, update, and view apps running on Snowflake across workloads such as Streamlit in Snowflake, the Snowflake Native App Framework, Snowpark Container Services, and Snowpark.
Description: |-
  Snowflake CLI is an open-source command-line tool explicitly designed for developer-centric workloads in addition to SQL operations. It is a flexible and extensible tool that can accommodate modern development practices and technologies.
  With Snowflake CLI, developers can create, manage, update, and view apps running on Snowflake across workloads such as Streamlit in Snowflake, the Snowflake Native App Framework, Snowpark Container Services, and Snowpark. It supports a range of Snowflake features, including user-defined functions, stored procedures, Streamlit in Snowflake, and SQL execution.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  New features and updates
  - Updated the snow streamlit deploy command to use the updated CREATE STREAMLIT syntax (FROM source_location) instead of the deprecated syntax (ROOT_LOCATION = ‘<stage_path_and_root_directory>’).
    Note
    The deprecated syntax is still supported, but Snowflake recommends using the new syntax for better clarity and consistency. You can use the snow streamlit deploy --legacy option to continue using the deprecated syntax.
  Bug fixes
  - None.
