ReleaseNotes: |-
  New features and updates
  - Added the --if-exists option to the snow object drop command and object-specific drop commands (for example, snow stage drop) to drop objects only if they exist, preventing errors when dropping non-existent objects.
  - Updated the project definition with supported Python versions aligned with snowflake-connector-python.
  Bug fixes
  - Fixed git repository path parsing to allow quotes around both repository and branch names (such as @"example-repo"/branches/"feature/branch"/*).
  - Fixed external browser authentication (EXTERNALBROWSER) for headless systems.
