ShortDescription: The reference compiler for the Sass style sheet language. Sass makes CSS fun.
Description: |
  Sass is a style sheet language that is transpiled to CSS. It allows you to use variables, nested rules, mixins, functions, and more, all with a fully CSS-compatible syntax. Sass helps keep large style sheets well-organized and makes it easy to share design within and across projects.
  This package is Dart Sass, the new Dart implementation of Sass.
