ReleaseNotes: "Simple installation\nThe easiest way to start using Spyder is by downloading our own installers for Windows, macOS and Linux:\n- Windows (Windows 10+): Spyder-Windows-x86_64.exe\n- macOS\n  \n  - M1 (14.0+): Spyder-macOS-arm64.pkg\n  - Intel (13.0+): Spyder-macOS-x86_64.pkg\n- Linux (CentOS 7+): Spyder-Linux-x86_64.sh\nNotes:\n- To use packages such as Scikit-learn or Seaborn with these installers, please read the following entry in our documentation FAQ.\n- To connect the installers to your current conda or pyenv environments, take a look at this other FAQ .\nAdvanced installation\nImportant Notes\n1. If you are new to Python or the Scientific Python ecosystem, we strongly recommend you to install and use Anaconda. It comes with Spyder and all its dependencies, along with the most important Python scientific libraries (i.e. Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, IPython, etc) in a single, easy to use environment.\n2. We also support pip, but please be aware that pip installations are for advanced users with good knowledge of all Spyder dependencies. Because of that, all installation problems you encounter are expected to be solved by you.\nAnaconda\nYou can easily install this version if you use Anaconda by closing Spyder and then running the following command in a system terminal (Anaconda Prompt on Windows, xterm on Linux or Terminal.app on macOS):\nconda create -n spyder-env -c conda-forge python=3.11\nconda activate spyder-env\nconda install -c conda-forge spyder=6.0.4\nPip\nYou can also use pip to update Spyder with the following command in a system terminal (cmd.exe on Windows, xterm on Linux or Terminal.app on macOS):\npip install -U spyder\nNote: Do not use this command if you are using Anaconda because it will break your installation.\nContributors\nA big thank you to all the contributors that made this major release possible: @Social-Mean @rear1019 @juliangilbey @jsbautista @athompson673 @ccordoba12 @mrclary @dalthviz @spyder-bot (our translators) @meeseeksmachine (backport bot) ðŸŽ‰\nRelease notes\nFor the full list of closed issues and merged pull requests in this release, please see our Changelog."
