  Advanced installation
  Important Notes
  1. If you are new to Python or the Scientific Python ecosystem, we strongly recommend you to install and use Anaconda. It comes with Spyder and all its dependencies, along with the most important Python scientific libraries (i.e. Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, IPython, etc) in a single, easy to use environment.
  2. We also support pip, but please be aware that pip installations are for advanced users with good knowledge of all Spyder dependencies. Because of that, all installation problems you encounter are expected to be solved by you.
  Anaconda
  You can easily install this version if you use Anaconda by closing Spyder and then running the following command in a system terminal (Anaconda Prompt on Windows, xterm on Linux or Terminal.app on macOS):
  conda create -n spyder-env -c conda-forge python=3.11
  conda activate spyder-env
  conda install -c conda-forge spyder=6.0.3

  Pip
  You can also use pip to update Spyder with the following command in a system terminal (cmd.exe on Windows, xterm on Linux or Terminal.app on macOS):
  pip install -U spyder

  Note: Do not use this command if you are using Anaconda because it will break your installation.Contributors
