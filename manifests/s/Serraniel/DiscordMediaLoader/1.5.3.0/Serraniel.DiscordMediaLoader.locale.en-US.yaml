  Changelog
  Bugfix
  - Fixed a typo which broke the guildname in the file or folder path (#107)
  Known bugs
  - May have problems when downloading an attachment and connection is broken or closed

  - The updates may fail to replace all files.
    If your application does not start after updating, please download the zip file or installer and replace files!
