Description: |-
  Cursor Lock is a utility program that confines the mouse cursor to a selected area on the screen.
  This is most useful in multi-monitor setups, addressing a common oversight in some applications
  (mostly games) whereby they allow the mouse cursor to drift into other unwanted screens.
  In video games, this can also lead to minimizing the game window if the cursor has drifted into
  another screen and the mouse is clicked accidentally. Cursor Lock can also overcome cursor drifting
  problems in windowed applications and games.
