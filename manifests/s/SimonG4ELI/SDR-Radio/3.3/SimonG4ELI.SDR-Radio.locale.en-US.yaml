ReleaseNotes: |-
  Server
    * Now working again when UDP is enabled.
    * Adding a server - when clicking Edit the list of radios, soundcards and bandwidths are reset.
    * Redesigned the server connection window - no change in function, just tidied up what previously was a very poor UI design.
  Satellites
    * Fixed satellite problem with very low LEO satellites, problem identified with GALASSIA.
  TX Voice Keyer
    * Corrected logic for stopping voice keyer when triggering TX from external source.
  Analyser
    * Minor change in FFT / DFT processing.
  Signal History
    * Signal History now prompts when the output file already exists.
  Data File Editor
    * Title is now V3.3,
    * Slightly changed layout,
    * More efficient background thread management.
  External Radio
    * Fixed fatal error in External Radio Options, Serial Ports, View.
  Identities
    * Identities windows redesigned, added Help Text.
    * The Main identity can now be renamed.
    * When editing an Identity title, the [X] Enable option is automatically set.
  S-Meter
    * Added a Default option to the S-meter configuration window.
  Frequency Database
    * Fixed error importing a custom frequency database with frequencies above 4 GHz.
  Blank Spectrum
    * Fixed error where then Spectrum stays blank in receiver window. Took me 4 hours to find this 6 year-old bug!
  Silent Installation
    * Fixed installer issues when using the silent (/S) switch. Had never tried a silent installation before.
  Pluto
    * Fixed bugs in the Pluto Temperature file as found by Sigi.
    * TX channels disabled and powered down when starting the radio.
    * I've extended the Pluto temperature file options so you can select the decimal separator if your locale-specific separator is not '.' . English and American users will not see a difference; German (Sigi) will.
  Help
    * Ribbon Bar, help - minor updates.
  ELAD S3
    * Fixed issues when downconverter not installed.
  Playback
    * Minor UI tweaks to the Playback window when Grid is selected.
    * Made the Stop button in the Playback Selection window more obvious.
  UI
    * Added a loudspeaker symbol in RX windows when the audio is not muted. If muted nothing is shown.
  Optimisation
    * Probably not noticeable but makes me feel better 🙂 . I see a slight drop running 24 Broadcast FM channels and the Matrix display.
  Audio Recording
    * Audio recording cache now only runs for the current (active) receiver, running on all was causing serious issues when many Broadcast-FM receivers were active. As part of hunting the above, I optimised the queue lists in the background threads (you'll not really notice much difference here).
