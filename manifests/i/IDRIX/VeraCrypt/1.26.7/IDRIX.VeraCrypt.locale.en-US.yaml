ShortDescription: VeraCrypt is a free open source disk encryption software for Windows, Mac OSX and Linux.
Description: |-
  VeraCrypt is a software for establishing and maintaining an on-the-fly-encrypted volume (data storage device). On-the-fly encryption means that data is automatically
  encrypted right before it is saved and decrypted right after it is loaded, without any user intervention. No data stored on an encrypted volume can be read (decrypted)
  without using the correct password/keyfile(s) or correct encryption keys. Entire file system is encrypted (e.g., file names, folder names, contents of every file,
  free space, meta data, etc). Files can be copied to and from a mounted VeraCrypt volume just like they are copied to/from any normal disk (for example, by simple
  drag-and-drop operations). Files are automatically being decrypted on the fly (in memory/RAM) while they are being read or copied from an encrypted VeraCrypt volume.
  Similarly, files that are being written or copied to the VeraCrypt volume are automatically being encrypted on the fly (right before they are written to the disk) in RAM.
  Note that this does not mean that the whole file that is to be encrypted/decrypted must be stored in RAM before it can be encrypted/decrypted. There are no extra memory
  (RAM) requirements for VeraCrypt.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Binaries for supported operating systems are also available at Sourceforge.Changes between 1.25.9 and 1.26.7 (1 October 2023) :
  - All OSes:
      - Security: Ensure that XTS primary key is different from the secondary key when creating volumes
          - Issue unlikely to happen thanks to random generator properties but this check must be added to prevent attacks
          - Reference: CCSS,NSA comment at page 3: https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/Projects/crypto-publication-review-project/documents/initial-comments/sp800-38e-initial-public-comments-2021.pdf
      - Remove TrueCrypt Mode support. Version 1.25.9 can be used to mount or convert TrueCrypt volumes.
      - Complete removal of RIPEMD160 and GOST89 algorithms. Legacy volumes using any of them cannot be mounted by VeraCrypt anymore.
      - Add support for BLAKE2s as new PRF algorithm for both system encryption and standard volumes.
      - Introducing support for EMV banking smart cards as keyfiles for non-system volumes.
          - No need for a separate PKCS#11 module configuration.
          - Card PIN isn't required.
          - Generates secure keyfile content from unique, encoded data present on the banking card.
          - Supports all EMV standard-compliant banking cards.
          - Can be enabled in settings (go to Settings->Security Tokens).
          - Developed by a team of students from the Institut national des sciences appliquées de Rennes.
          - More details about the team and the project are available at https://projets-info.insa-rennes.fr/projets/2022/VeraCrypt/index_en.html.
      - When overwriting an existing file container during volume creation, add its current size to the available free space
      - Add Corsican language support. Update several translations.
      - Update documentation
  - Windows:
      - Officially, the minimum supported version is now Windows 10. VeraCrypt may still run on Windows 7 and Windows 8/8.1, but no active tests are done on these platforms.
      - EFI Bootloader:
          - Fix bug in PasswordTimeout value handling that caused it to be limited to 255 seconds.
          - Rescue Disk: enhance "Boot Original Windows Loader" by using embedded backup of original Windows loader if it is missing from disk
          - Addition of Blake2s and removal of RIPEMD160 & GOST89
      - Enable memory protection by default. Add option under Performance/Driver Configuration to disable it if needed.
          - Memory protection blocks non-admin processes from reading VeraCrypt memory
          - It may block Screen Readers (Accessibility support) from reading VeraCrypt UI, in which case it can be disabled
          - It can be disabled by setting registry value "VeraCryptEnableMemoryProtection" to 0 under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\veracrypt
      - Add process mitigation policy to prevent VeraCrypt from being injected by other processes
      - Minor enhancements to RAM Encryption implementation
      - Fix Secure Desktop issues under Windows 11 22H2
      - Implement support for mounting partially encrypted system partitions.
      - Fix false positive detection of new device insertion when Clear Encryption Keys option is enable (System Encryption case only)
      - Better implementation of Fast Create when creating file containers that uses UAC to request required privilege if not already held
      - Allow choosing Fast Create in Format Wizard UI when creating file containers
      - Fix formatting issues during volume creation on some machines.
      - Fix stall issue caused by Quick Format of large file containers
      - Add dropdown menu to Mount button to allow mounting without using the cache.
      - Possible workaround for logarithmic slowdown for Encrypt-In-Place on large volumes.
      - Make Expander first check file existence before proceeding further
      - Allow selecting size unit (KB/MB/GB) for generated keyfiles
      - Display full list of supported cluster sizes for NTFS, ReFS and exFAT filesystems when creating volumes
      - Support drag-n-drop of files and keyfiles in Expander.
      - Implement translation of Expander UI
      - Replace legacy file/dir selection APIs with modern IFileDialog interface for better Windows 11 compatibility
      - Enhancements to dependency dlls safe loading, including delay loading.
      - Remove recommendation of keyfiles files extensions and update documentation to mention risks of third-party file extensions.
      - Add support for more language in the setup installer
      - Update LZMA library to version 23.01
      - Update libzip to version 1.10.1 and zlib to version 1.3.
      - Linux:
          - Fix bug in Random generator on Linux when used with Blake2s that was triggering a self test failure.
          - Modify Random Generator on Linux to exactly match official documentation and the Windows implementation.
          - Fix compatibility issues with Ubuntu 23.04.
          - Fix assert messages displayed when using wxWidgets 3.1.6 and newer.
          - Fix issues launching fsck on Linux.
          - Fix privilege escalation prompts being ignored.
          - Fix wrong size for hidden volume when selecting the option to use all free space.
          - Fix failure to create hidden volume on a disk using CLI caused by wrong maximum size detection.
          - Fix various issues when running in Text mode:
              - Don't allow selecting exFAT/BTRFS filesytem if they are not present or not compatible with the created volume.
              - Fix wrong dismount message displayed when mounting a volume.
              - Hide PIM during entry and re-ask PIM when user entered a wrong value.
