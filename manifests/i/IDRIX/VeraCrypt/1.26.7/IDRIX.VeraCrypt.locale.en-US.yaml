ReleaseNotes: |-
  Changes between 1.25.9 and 1.26.7 (1 October 2023) :
  - All OSes:
  - Security: Ensure that XTS primary key is different from the secondary key when creating volumes
  - Issue unlikely to happen thanks to random generator properties but this check must be added to prevent attacks
  - Reference: CCSS,NSA comment at page 3: https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/Projects/crypto-publication-review-project/documents/initial-comments/sp800-38e-initial-public-comments-2021.pdf
  - Remove TrueCrypt Mode support.
    Version 1.25.9 can be used to mount or convert TrueCrypt volumes.
  - Complete removal of RIPEMD160 and GOST89 algorithms.
    Legacy volumes using any of them cannot be mounted by VeraCrypt anymore.
  - Add support for BLAKE2s as new PRF algorithm for both system encryption and standard volumes.
  - Introducing support for EMV banking smart cards as keyfiles for non-system volumes.
  - No need for a separate PKCS#11 module configuration.
  - Card PIN isn't required.
  - Generates secure keyfile content from unique, encoded data present on the banking card.
  - Supports all EMV standard-compliant banking cards.
  - Can be enabled in settings (go to Settings->Security Tokens).
  - Developed by a team of students from the Institut national des sciences appliqu√©es de Rennes.
  - More details about the team and the project are available at https://projets-info.insa-rennes.fr/projets/2022/VeraCrypt/index_en.html.

  - Memory protection blocks non-admin processes from reading VeraCrypt memory
  - It may block Screen Readers (Accessibility support) from reading VeraCrypt UI, in which case it can be disabled
