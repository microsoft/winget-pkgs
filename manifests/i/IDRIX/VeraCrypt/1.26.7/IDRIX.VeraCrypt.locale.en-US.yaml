  II. Use, Copying, and Distribution of This Product

  1. Provided that You comply with all applicable terms and
  conditions of this License, You may make copies of This Product
  (unmodified) and distribute copies of This Product (unmodified)
  that are not included in another product forming Your Product
  (except as permitted under Chapter III). Note: For terms and
  conditions for copying and distribution of modified versions of
  This Product, see Chapter III.

  2. Provided that You comply with all applicable terms and
  conditions of this License, You may use This Product freely (see
  also Chapter III) on any number of computers/systems for non-
  commercial and/or commercial purposes.



  III. Modification, Derivation, and Inclusion in Other Products

  1. If all conditions specified in the following paragraphs in
  this Chapter (III) are met (for exceptions, see Section III.2)
  and if You comply with all other applicable terms and conditions
  of this License, You may modify This Product (thus forming Your
  Product), derive new works from This Product or portions thereof
  (thus forming Your Product), include This Product or portions
  thereof in another product (thus forming Your Product, unless
  defined otherwise in Chapter I), and You may use (for non-
  commercial and/or commercial purposes), copy, and/or distribute
  Your Product.

      a. The name of Your Product (or of Your modified version of
      This Product) must not contain the name TrueCrypt (for
      example, the following names are not allowed: TrueCrypt,
      TrueCrypt+, TrueCrypt Professional, iTrueCrypt, etc.) nor
      any other names confusingly similar to the name TrueCrypt
      (e.g., True-Crypt, True Crypt, TruKrypt, etc.)

      All occurrences of the name TrueCrypt that could reasonably
      be considered to identify Your Product must be removed from
      Your Product and from any associated materials. Logo(s)
      included in (or attached to) Your Product (and in/to
      associated materials) must not incorporate and must not be
      confusingly similar to any of the TrueCrypt logos
      (including, but not limited to, the non-textual logo
      consisting primarily of a key in stylized form) or
      portion(s) thereof. All graphics contained in This Product
      (logos, icons, etc.) must be removed from Your Product (or
      from Your modified version of This Product) and from any
      associated materials.

      b. The following phrases must be removed from Your Product
      and from any associated materials, except the text of this
      License: "A TrueCrypt Foundation Release", "Released by
      TrueCrypt Foundation", "This is a TrueCrypt Foundation
      release."

      c. Phrase "Based on TrueCrypt, freely available at
      http://www.truecrypt.org/" must be displayed by Your Product
      (if technically feasible) and contained in its
      documentation. Alternatively, if This Product or its portion
      You included in Your Product constitutes only a minor
      portion of Your Product, phrase "Portions of this product
      are based in part on TrueCrypt, freely available at
      http://www.truecrypt.org/" may be displayed instead. In each
      of the cases mentioned above in this paragraph,
      "http://www.truecrypt.org/" must be a hyperlink (if
      technically feasible) pointing to http://www.truecrypt.org/
      and You may freely choose the location within the user
      interface (if there is any) of Your Product (e.g., an
      "About" window, etc.) and the way in which Your Product will
      display the respective phrase.

      Your Product (and any associated materials, e.g., the
      documentation, the content of the official web site of Your
      Product, etc.) must not present any Internet address
      containing the domain name truecrypt.org (or any domain name
      that forwards to the domain name truecrypt.org) in a manner
      that might suggest that it is where information about Your
      Product may be obtained or where bugs found in Your Product
      may be reported or where support for Your Product may be
      available or otherwise attempt to indicate that the domain
      name truecrypt.org is associated with Your Product.

      d. The complete source code of Your Product must be freely
      and publicly available (for exceptions, see Section III.2)
      at least until You cease to distribute Your Product. This
      condition can be met in one or both of the following ways:
      (i) You include the complete source code of Your Product
      with every copy of Your Product that You make and distribute
      and You make all such copies of Your Product available to
      the general public free of charge, and/or (ii) You include
      information (valid and correct at least until You cease to
      distribute Your Product) about where the complete source
      code of Your Product can be obtained free of charge (e.g.,
      an Internet address) or for a reasonable reproduction fee
      with every copy of Your Product that You make and distribute
      and, if there is a web site officially associated with Your
      Product, You include the aforementioned information about
      the source code on a freely and publicly accessible web
      page to which such web site links via an easily viewable
      hyperlink (at least until You cease to distribute Your
      Product).

      The source code of Your Product must not be deliberately
      obfuscated and it must not be in an intermediate form (e.g.,
      the output of a preprocessor). Source code means the
      preferred form in which a programmer would usually modify
      the program.

      Portions of the source code of Your Product not contained in
      This Product (e.g., portions added by You in creating Your
      Product, whether created by You or by third parties) must be
      available under license(s) that (however, see also
      Subsection III.1.e) allow(s) anyone to modify and derive new
      works from the portions of the source code that are not
      contained in This Product and to use, copy, and redistribute
      such modifications and/or derivative works. The license(s)
      must be perpetual, non-exclusive, royalty-free, no-charge,
      and worldwide, and must not invalidate, weaken, restrict,
      interpret, amend, modify, interfere with or otherwise affect
      any part, term, provision, or clause of this License. The
      text(s) of the license(s) must be included with every copy
      of Your Product that You make and distribute.

      e. You must not change the license terms of This Product in
      any way (adding any new terms is considered changing the
      license terms even if the original terms are retained),
      which means, e.g., that no part of This Product may be put
      under another license. You must keep intact all the legal
      notices contained in the source code files. You must include
      the following items with every copy of Your Product that You
      make and distribute: a clear and conspicuous notice stating
      that Your Product or portion(s) thereof is/are governed by
      this version of the TrueCrypt License, a verbatim copy of
      this version of the TrueCrypt License (as contained herein),
      a clear and conspicuous notice containing information about
      where the included copy of the License can be found, and an
      appropriate copyright notice.


  2. You are not obligated to comply with Subsection III.1.d if
  Your Product is not distributed (i.e., Your Product is available
  only to You).



  IV. Disclaimer of Liability, Disclaimer of Warranty,
  Indemnification

  You expressly acknowledge and agree to the following:
