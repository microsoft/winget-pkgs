  Release Notes
  Overview
  The underlying view system has gone through an almost complete rewrite (#473). This major overhaul enabled us to implement various features that weren't possible before and made most of the UI clickable.
  What's new:
  - Mouse-clickable UI: details panel, evolog, git remotes, bookmark remotes, and more
  - Mouse wheel scrolling support across all views
  - Foundation for new interactive features like target picker and revset completion box
  Highlights
  🎉 Which-Key Style Status Bar (#503)
  The status bar now works like which-key in Emacs/Vim:
  - Dynamically adjusts to window width - shows ?/more when space is limited
  - Press ? to expand and see all available keybindings
  - Works with stacked menus (git, bookmarks) to show context-specific help
  - Press esc to collapse
  - Replaces the old help menu
  🎯 Target Picker for Operations (#490)
  Operations like rebase, new, edit, and squash now support an interactive target picker:
  - Press t to open the target picker
  - Select a revision or type a custom target (bookmark name, change ID, etc.)
  - Press enter to execute the command

  - Added 16 missing revset functions: bisect, divergent, none, subject, connected, heads, roots, reachable, tracked, untracked, conflict, file, diff, author_date, committer_date, working_copies
  - Fixed function signatures and renamed diff_contains to diff_lines
  - Shows full completion list when history is empty
  - Better visual styling and source-based completion
  🔍 Backward Quick Search Navigation (#509)
