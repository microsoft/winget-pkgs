  What's Changed
  Improvements
  Revset
  - Completions show on the second line as a list now. You can use tab/shift+tab to cycle forward/backward.
  - Loads and adds revset-aliases defined in your jj config to the list of completions.
  - Keeps the history. You can use up/down to cycle through revset history. History is only available during the session. (i.e. it's not persisted)

  Squash
  Got two new modifiers:
  - You can use e for keeping the source revision empty (--keep-emptied)
  - You can use i for running the squash operation in interactive mode (--interactive)
  - Squash key configuration has changed:
    [keys.squash]
      mode = ["S"]
      keep_emptied = ["e"]
      interactive = ["i"]

  Rebase
  Revisions to be moved are marked with move marker, and get updated according to the target. (i.e. branch/source will mark all revisions to be moved according to the target)

  Minor
  - Details: Added absorb option to absorb changes in the selected files.
  - Help window is updated to have 3-columns now.
  - Changed auto refresh to proceed only when there's an actual change.
  - JJ's colour palette is loaded from jj config at start up and applied to change_id, rest, diff renamed, diff modified, diff removed. This is the first step towards implementing colour themes for jjui.
  Fixes
  - Revisions view don't get stuck in loading state when the revset don't return any results.
  - Selections should be kept as is across auto refreshes.
  - Fixed various issues about bookmark management where delete bookmark menu items were not shown, and track/untrack items were shown incorrectly under certain circumstances #155 #156
  - Double width characters should not cause visual glitches #138
  - Fixed visual glitches when extending graph lines to accommodate graph overlays
