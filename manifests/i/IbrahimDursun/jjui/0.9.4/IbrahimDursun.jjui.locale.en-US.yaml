ReleaseNotes: |-
  A point release mostly made of community contributions. Thanks to all the contributors (via code or feedback or reporting issues) ❤️
  I have been most working on the v0.10 refactoring, so that's why this release is delayed for quite some time and I also didn't get my full focus as I have been maintaining two different codebases.
  Here are some highlights of the changes in this release.
  - ui: jjui can do focus tracking (if it is supported by your terminal). jjui will refresh itself once it receives the focus back.
  - redo: Added support for jj redo which is bound to U key.
  - git: jj git push --changes can work on multiple revisions #321
  - inline describe: Pressing alt+e in the inline describe will launch the description editing in your configured $EDITOR #317
  - split: Pressing alt+s will pass --parallel to the split command #324
  - megamerge: Due to popular demand megamerge has been renamed to set_parents.
  - squash: pressing alt+enter will apply the command with --ignore-immutable.
  - rebase: pressing e will toggle --skip-emptied argument.
  Let me know if something is broken and enjoy!
