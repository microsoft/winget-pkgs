ReleaseNotes: |-
  This release contains some minor improvements and bug fixes.
  - Help window is now searchable. #334
  - changed preview to run in the background while getting the diff contents to improve UI responsiveness. #336
  - fix: async command executor used to append --color always to the end of the command to get colourful output but this broke some commands that expect arguments. This change moves the --color always to the beginning of the command. #339
  - Added pgup and pgdown bindings to the revisions view so that you can jump down/up without having to press j/k multiple times. #347
  - improved handling of bookmarks that contain -- characters in their name. jj returns these bookmarks with quotes which jjui didn't handle well. #346
  - JJUI_CONFIG_DIR is changed to match the documentation where it will load the configuration from $JJUI_CONFIG_DIR/config.toml rather than $JJUI_CONFIG_DIR/jjui/config.toml #343
  - ace jump didn't highlight change ids in some template configuration. It should highlight change ids and commit ids correctly now.
