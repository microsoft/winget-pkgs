ReleaseNotes: |-
  🎉 This release enhances performance and introduces stability improvements in log parsing and command execution. It also takes back some of the stability by adding basic mouse support.
  Features
  📈 Performance Improvements
  Implemented frame-rate limited rendering (capped at 120 FPS) to significantly improve application performance by deferring view generation until the next frame tick. This addresses the slowest path in the application - view generation - making it much more responsive
  🐭 Mouse Support
  - Clickable and scrollable revisions view (excluding operations) (#391)
  - Clickable and scrollable op log view
  - Draggable and scrollable (vertically + horizontally) preview pane
  - Scrollable diff window
  - Replaced custom viewport with bubbles/viewport for more responsive rendering (#396)

  🔎 Preview
  - Replaced surrounding border with divider for more preview space (#396)
  Operation Log (oplog)
  - Added jj op revert functionality with R key binding (#400)
  Revset Handling
  - Pressing up arrow in empty revset field now sets the current revset (#284)
  - Fixed mismatch where empty revset input would use config default instead of session default from -r flag. Now correctly updates CurrentRevset to session default instead of empty string (#399)
  Details View
  - Allow quitting from details view when quit key is pressed (e.g. q)
  Bug Fixes
  Rendering Issues
  - Fixed double rendering of inline describe content when next line contains only revision line. Added revisionLineRendered tracking flag to properly sequence the description overlay rendering (#403, #369)
  - Fixed viewport adjustment when PageDown moves cursor below viewport. The renderer now continues rendering until it reaches the focused item, ensuring proper viewport adjustment (#395)
  - Fixed PageUp/Down navigation at top and bottom of revset when less than one page remains. Now includes early return with feedback message when already at boundary (#387, #386)
  - Removed incorrect space trimming in renderer (#393)
  Log Processing
  - Applied partial fixes to prevent out-of-order row updates in log streamer
  Details View
  - Handle cases where conflict markers span multiple lines (#398)
  - Ignore virtual selection on refresh (#381)
  Operation Log (oplog)
  - Fixed an issue in operation ID detection (#380, #377)
  Command Execution
  - Added a mechanism for restoring failed commands to input field, allowing retries without retyping (#392)
  Template System
  - Enhanced jj log parsing using native template prefixes for better change ID and commit ID detection. Fixes issues when bookmarks are "HexLike" (#358, #228, #372)
