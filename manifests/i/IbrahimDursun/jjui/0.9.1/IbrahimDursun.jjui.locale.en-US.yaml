ReleaseNotes: |-
  This was supposed to be a maintenance release but it is packed with new features thanks to all the contributors!
  Phew, another release which was supposed to be a minor maintenance release but to be honest, I didn't much other than implementing flash messages and lane tracing.
  All the remaining features are implemented by contributors: @vic @zerowidth @penryu Thanks!
  New Features
  ðŸŽ‰ Flash messages
  jjui now shows the output of the commands as flash messages. Success messages disappear after 4 seconds, and failure messages stay sticky and can be dismissed with esc.
  ðŸŽ‰ Fuzzy file search
  Pressing ctrl+t opens up the fuzzy file search. Choosing one file from the list will change the revset to show all changes made to that file. #203
  Additionally, when the fuzzy file search is open, you can use ctrl+t again to turn on preview mode to see the contents of the file and the changes made to the file.
  ðŸŽ‰ Ace jump
  Similar to how vim's ace jump works, pressing f will highlight the first character of each change id (only non-hidden, non-conflicting, and non-root) or each commit id and typing the letters until an unambigous revision is found will jump the cursor to that revision.
  ðŸŽ‰ (experimental) Lane tracing
  This is an experimental feature and currently disabled by default, but you can enable it with the following configuration:
  [ui.tracer]
  enabled = true
  When tracing is enabled, lanes that the currently selected revision in are highlighted and out of lane revisions are fainted.
  ðŸŽ‰ Restore from evolog
  While in the evolog view, you can now press r to restore the selected evolog into the target revision you select.
  The operation will run equivalent of the following command:
  jj restore --from <selected evolog commit id> --into <selected target revision change id> --restore-descendants
  As a result of this new functionality, evolog key bindings turned into a table with the following defaults:
  [keys.evolog]
    mode = ["v"]
    diff = ["d"]
    restore = ["r"]
  ðŸŽ‰ Preview window at the bottom of the UI
  Pressing shift+p will move the preview window to the bottom of the screen. This can be made the default position with the following configuration:
  [ui.preview]
  show_at_bottom = true
  ðŸŽ‰ Force apply
  Performing an operation on an immutable revision returned an error in jjui. Now you can use alt+enter to force the command to ignore immutable revisions. (i.e. add --ignore-immutable argument)
  Default key binding configuration is like the following:
  [keys]
  force_apply = ["alt+enter"]
  ðŸŽ‰ Log batching
  Log batching will only load the first 50 revisions and load the next chunk if you scroll past the 50th revision. Previously, jjui loaded the whole logs before it displayed the revisions. This new method should reduce the start up times greatly if you are working with large repositories. It almost has no effect if you are working with small repositories.
  This has been an experimental feature for a while, turned off by default, behind the experimental_log_batching_enabled configuration option.
  In this release it is turned on by default, but the configuration location has been moved to the following and you can still turn it off if you like:
  [revisions]
  log_batching = false
  Minor Changes
  Light and Dark theme syntax
  Theme configuration now allows choosing different themes for light and dark themes.
  [ui.theme]
  light = "my-light-theme"
  dark = "my-dark-theme"
  Previous syntax is still supported, which will set light and dark to be the same value.
  [ui]
  theme = "my-theme"
  Conflict markers in details view
  Details view now show conflict markers next to the conflicted files.
  Make default log format and revset configurable
  jjui reads and uses the default revset and the log format as they are configured in jj.
  You can now override these values with the following configuration:
  [revisions]
  template = 'builtin_log_compact' # overrides jj's templates.log
  revset = ""  # overrides jj's revsets.log
  Confirmation dialogs show menu option shortcuts in the status bar
  Previously, you needed to know pressing y for yes and n for no. These shortcuts now are displayed in the status bar.
  New placeholders for commands
  The following new place holders are added:
  - $commit_id
  - $checked_commit_ids
  - $checked_files
