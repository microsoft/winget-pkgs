ReleaseNotes: |-
  New: redesigned user interface in the configuration editor; browser picker displays icons graphically and sorts them based on frequency of use; if there is more than one rule match in different browsers, UI will ask which one you want instead of using the first one.
  Improved: even thought there are more features in this release, it’s considerably smaller in size and faster.
