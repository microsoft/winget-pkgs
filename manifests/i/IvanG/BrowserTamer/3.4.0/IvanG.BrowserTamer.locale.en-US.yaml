ReleaseNotes: |-
  New
  - When editing browser profiles, you can optionally add your own custom arguments to pass to the browser (see extra args). Thanks to @AJolly for the idea.
  - URL Picker has an option to turn off recording of "popularity".
  - Documentation website is now live. It's small and simple, but allows to add more structured content, unlike blog pages.
  - Ability to hide browsers from configuration window was added. This affects both configuration and picker, so you won't see browsers you are not interested in.
  - Rules can be reordered by simply pressing ⬆️ or ⬇️ keys on the keyboard. Thanks to @maluht for the idea in #13.
  - When editing rule, you can jump to next edit box with tab or previous with shift+tab.
  - Status bar shows number of browsers, profiles, and configured rules.
  - GitHub releases publishes SHA-256 checksums.

  Improvements
  - Updating custom browser name will also update it in browser list as you type.
  - Other cosmetic pedantic improvements.

  Bugs Fixed
  - Picker would not work if you enable "frameless window" but pick a browser that does not support this feature. Browser list now also indicates if browser supports frameless feature. Thanks to @D3XX3R in #20.
  - Tray icon tooltip was not displaying. It should have shown application name and version number.
