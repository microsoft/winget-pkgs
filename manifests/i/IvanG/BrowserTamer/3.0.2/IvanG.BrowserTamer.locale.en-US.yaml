ReleaseNotes: |-
  New Features:
  ! License terms updated so that you don't have to buy me a cake (including vanilla) or assign your first-born child. You are obliged to buy me a coffee though, which is cheaper than cake.
  Bugs Fixed:
  - CPU usage metric is unreliable and is temporarily removed.
