ReleaseNotes: |-
  New
  - Match rules support regular expressions syntax.
  - Support for Firefox Containers added! Firefox containers link redirection works with Open external links in a container by Denys H extension or my own Browser Tamer extension.
  - Added Firefox integration extension (link available from Help menu) and published source code for Chromium and Firefox extensions.
  - Added native support for Waterfox. This means BT will treat Waterfox just like Firefox, including support for profiles, private mode, containers and the rest.

  Improvements
  - config.ini is slightly simpler - removed open_cmd and vdf keys as they are not required anymore.
  - Browser profiles are sorted by the order they appear in the browser itself instead of alphabetically.
  - Chromium browsers have a convenience toolbar button that links to browser store to download optional integration extension.
  - Visual: "incognito" modes are marked with a visual icon.
  - Firefox: profile discovery skips default profile which is intended for some kind of alpha testing and has no meaning to a normal user. default-release profiles is now displayed as Primary as this is exactly what it is.
  - Infrastructure: release notes are removed from application code and replaced by a link to GitHub to avoid duplication and gradually increasing application size as they grow.

  Bugs Fixed
  - health check: if BT is installed as browser but to a different directory than you are launching from, validation was still succeeding.
  - health check: status icon was not updating after health is fixed from dashboard.
