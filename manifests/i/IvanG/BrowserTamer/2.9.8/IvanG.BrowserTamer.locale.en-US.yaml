ReleaseNotes: |-
  New Features:
  ! BT will automatically shut-down if not used for 30 minutes to consume even less resources. You can disable that in settings, but I'm not sure why you would do that'.
  Improvements:
  + Browser uptime is displayed as a part of browser stats
  + Browser profile overlays in the picker are rounded similar to how Chromium paints them.
  + Multi-window interface
  Bugs Fixed:
  - Change Log was trimming older entries so you couldn't see them at all.
  - Picker Enabled setting was always ignored and picker was shown regardless
  - Uninstaller completely removes all traces of BT from the system
