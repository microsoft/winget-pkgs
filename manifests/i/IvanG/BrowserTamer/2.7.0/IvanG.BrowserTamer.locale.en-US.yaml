ReleaseNotes: |-
  New: added system notification icon - click to open configuration, right-click for more options.
  Bug fixed: Sometimes URL picker will show only when “ctrl” is pressed.
  System improvements: using windows messaging instead of named pipes which would trigger antivirus false positive sometimes. Also executable size is now even smaller.
