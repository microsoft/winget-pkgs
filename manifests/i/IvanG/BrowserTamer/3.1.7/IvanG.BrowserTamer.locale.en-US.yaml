ReleaseNotes: |-
  New Features
  - You can run in truly portable mode (where config.ini is stored alongside bt.exe) by creating an empty '.portable' file in the same directory. Thanks to @maluht in #6.

  Improvements
  - Various code stability improvements
  - Added 'Add' button to the main UI, to emplasise you can add your custom browser. Previously it was available only from the File menu.

  Bugs Fixed
  - BT would crash on start of configuration window for new installations due to expecting at least one browser to be registered.
