ShortDescription: A free, open-source software suite for editing and manipulating digital images
Description: |-
  ImageMagick® is a free, open-source software suite, used for editing and manipulating digital images. It can be used to create, edit, compose, or convert bitmap images, and supports a wide range of file formats, including JPEG, PNG, GIF, TIFF, and Ultra HDR.
  ImageMagick is widely used in industries such as web development, graphic design, and video editing, as well as in scientific research, medical imaging, and astronomy. Its versatile and customizable nature, along with its robust image processing capabilities, make it a popular choice for a wide range of image-related tasks.
  ImageMagick includes a command-line interface for executing complex image processing tasks, as well as APIs for integrating its features into software applications. It is written in C and can be used on a variety of operating systems, including Linux, Windows, and macOS.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Merged
  - try pngalpha if png16malpha not available #8034
  Commits
  - beta release fe966f5
  - negate SSIM similarity image 225b65d
  - cosmetic 66985e8
  - TIFFGetFieldDefaulted doesn't work for TIFFTAG_PHOTOMETRIC so we need to use TIFFGetField instead. b64d7a9
  - Remove heic:max-image-size-pixels option and use our limits instead. c4afe0b
  - fix issue with similarity search of two images of same dimensions 62cb29b
  - for NCC metric, identical is 1 not 0 4130489
  - Only divide the value once when scaling quantum to an unsigned char. This is probably already optimized by the compiler but this change makes our intent more clear. fb883b5
  - restore output of PSNR metric fae1740
  - special similarity one-off if image and reconstruction have same dimensions 221e702
  - don't encode URI '/' 8f23ea7
  - scale PSNR output by 100 6c69f79
  - scale PSNR by 48.1647 4071458
  - revert special case where target and reconstruction is the same dimensions 9224c0d
  - special case where target and reconstruction are same size f060e09
  - improve detection of RLE decoding e4df167
  - strip thumbnail URI of decorators 934d3f9
  - respect filename:literal define for both input and output filenames 1b0f75e
  - revert e6be257
  - PSNR metric returned incorrect results for spatial, FFT worked fine 4678062
  - remove debug statement 1872f0a
  - Set the max_color_profile_size using GetMaxProfileSize instead. 27d8f79
  - Added missing typecast. 7ee7ea3
  - release 8209e84
