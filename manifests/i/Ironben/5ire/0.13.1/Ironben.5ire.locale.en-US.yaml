ShortDescription: A Sleek AI Assistant & MCP Client
Description: |-
  Simplicity and user-friendliness are at the core of our design. We understand the importance of an intuitive interface and have ensured that even novice can find it extremely easy to harness the power of these large language models.
  Key Features
  1. Support Tools via MCP Servers
  MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications. Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect your devices to various peripherals and accessories, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools.
  With tools, you can access the file system, obtain system information, interact with databases, access remote data, and more, rather than just having a simple conversation.
  We have created an open marketplace for MCP Servers. it empowers users to discover exceptional tools while offering a streamlined process for sharing their own MCP server creations.
  2. Local Knowledge Base
  We have integrated the bge-m3 as our local embedding model, which excels in multilingual vectorization. 5ire now supports parsing and vectorization of docx, xlsx, pptx, pdf, txt, and csv documents, enabling storage of these vectors to power robust Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities locally.
  3. Usage Analytics
  By keeping track of your API usage and spending, you can gain a better understanding of how much you're spending on the API and make informed decisions to optimize your use of the service.
  4. Prompts Library
  The prompt library provides an effective way to create and organize your own prompts. These prompts are highly versatile, thanks to their support for variables.
  5. Bookmarks
  You can bookmark each conversation, and even if the original messages are deleted, the saved bookmarked content remains unaffected.
