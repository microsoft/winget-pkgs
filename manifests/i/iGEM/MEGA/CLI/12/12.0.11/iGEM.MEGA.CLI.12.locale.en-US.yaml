ShortDescription: Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis
Description: Genome sequencing is generating vast amounts of DNA sequence data from a wide range of organisms. As a result, gene sequence databases are growing rapidly. In order to conduct efficient analyses of these data, there is a need for easy-to-use computer programs, containing fast computational algorithms and useful statistical methods. The objective of the MEGA software has been to provide tools for exploring, discovering, and analyzing DNA and protein sequences from an evolutionary perspective.
