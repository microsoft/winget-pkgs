ShortDescription: Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis
Description: Genome sequencing is generating vast amounts of DNA sequence data from a wide range of organisms. As a result, gene sequence databases are growing rapidly. In order to conduct efficient analyses of these data, there is a need for easy-to-use computer programs, containing fast computational algorithms and useful statistical methods. The objective of the MEGA software has been to provide tools for exploring, discovering, and analyzing DNA and protein sequences from an evolutionary perspective.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Updates
  - The installers for Windows operating systems are now code-signed.
  Bug Fixes
  - Ancestral sequence inference when using the UCSC 46-species tree has been updated to maintain the correct tree rooting. This is part of the mutation diagnosis analysis.
  - Fixed size and positioning of components when using the Calibration Editor on high dpi monitors.
  - Refactored naive mapping of taxa groups that was sluggish for very large data.
  - Fixed an access violation when using the prototyper to generate a .mao file for Reltime with branch lengths.
