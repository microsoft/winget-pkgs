ReleaseNotes: |-
  ILSpy 9.x is based on .NET 8.0. All artifacts except the self-contained distribution are built framework-dependent, which means .NET 8.0.x or later must be installed prior to starting ILSpy. Note that ILSpy 9.1 also allows a later runtime via #3391.
  New Language Features
  - Update pattern-detection to Roslyn 4.13
  Enhancements
  - #1572: Do not generate variable names that match C# keywords.
  - #2716: Add an option to allow sorting custom attributes
  - #3377: Extend error information if multiple assemblies with the same (short) name are selected when creating a solution file.
  - #3393: Option to turn off smooth scrolling
  - #3399: Add module filename as ToolTip of AnalyzerEntityTreeNode
  - #3440: Added support for evaluation-order-preserving reference type check
  - #3316: Add "variable scopes" to improve naming local variables and anonymous method parameters
  Contributions
  - Add support for array initialization based on RuntimeHelpers.CreateSpan<T> (see #3380 by @ds5678)
  - Load resource stream outside of delegate (see #3389 by @snorrk)
  - Allow ILSpy to launch, when net8.0 is not installed, but a later version (see #3391 by @nil4)
  - Fix nested namespace directories (see #3449 by @ds5678)
  - Fix #3402: System.NullReferenceException on right click on .NET 9 (see #3403 by @tom-englert)
  - Add an option to turn off smooth scrolling (see #3405 by @tom-englert)
  - Use type hint in pointer arithmetic (see #3413 by @ds5678)
  - Improve UI for primary constructors on non-record types (see #3455 by @ds5678)
  - Fix exception when writing resx files without adding any resources (see #3418 by @jwfx)
  - Enhance null handling in switch transformations (see #3422 by @ds5678)
  - Don't include generic constraints in generated explicit overrides (see #3443 by @ds5678)
  - Improve generation of not equals check (see #3425 by @ElektroKill)
  Bug fixes
  - Fix #2269: LocalFunctionDecompiler misplaces nested local functions in ctors
  - Fix #3322: Add missing checks for equality comparison
  - Fix #3378: Navigation shortcuts (Alt-Left and Alt-Right) don't work when TreeView has focus
  - Fix #3381: Make sure that selectedNode is still selected when focus is deferred in IsActive property changed handler.
  - Fix #3383: more aggressively transform object initializers on structs
  - Fix #3384: add special case for null-literal conversions in optional argument handling.
  - Fix #3385: Allow address uses of structs in using transform, if the reference is passed to an in parameter.
  - Fix #3392: uses of init-setters must use object-initializer syntax.
  - Fix #3401: Multiple problems when exporting an assembly as project
  - Fix #3414: Apply latest session settings before saving upon closing the main window
  - Fix #3342: Wrong null check in MethodVirtualUsedByAnalyzer
  - Fix #3450: Fix "Clear assembly list" not actually persistent.
  - Fix #3432: Do not include delegate construction use-sites in DetermineCaptureAndDeclarationScopes.
  - Fix attributes tooltip of GenericParam metadata table
