ShortDescription: Automated exchange of data between cloud applications, databases and files on Windows, MacOS and Linux devices.
Description: Invantive Data Hub transports data between cloud applications, relational databases and files in one integrated solution.

Invantive Data Hub reliably handles large volumes of data on Windows, MacOS and Linux. The headless capability eases integration with the task scheduler of choice such as Windows Task Scheduler or the Linux cron daemon.
