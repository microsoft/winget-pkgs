ShortDescription: PresenceLight is a solution to broadcast your various statuses to light bulbs.
Description: 'PresenceLight is a solution to broadcast your various statuses to various kinds of smart lights. Some statuses you can broadcast are: your availability in Microsoft Teams, your current Windows 10 theme, and a theme or color of your choosing. What PresenceLight does is leverage the Presence Api, which is available in Microsoft Graph, allowing to retrieve your presence without having to be tethered. This could potentially allow someone to update the light bulb from a remote machine they do not use.'
