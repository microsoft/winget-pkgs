ShortDescription: Polyglot Data Modeling for SQL and NoSQL databases, APIs, and storage formats
Description: |-
  Hackolade Studio is an intuitive yet powerful application to perform the visually data modeling and schema design of many SQL and NoSQL databases, APIS, and storage formats.
  Hackolade Studio combines the graphical representation of collections in an Entity Relationship Diagram, with the graphical representation of the JSON Schema definition of each collection in a hierarchical schema view. Together, these graphical representations provide the schema model for data-at-rest and data-in-motion, plus the documentation of that model. The application is specifically designed around the powerful nature of JSON nested sub-objects and denormalization.
  The software facilitates the work of, and the dialog between analysts, architects, designers, developers, testers, DBAs, and operators of systems that are based on such technologies. It also can generate schema scripts and documentation in a variety of machine-readable formats (DDLs, JSON Schema, Avro, Parquet, Protobuf, ...) as well as database instances, or human-readable formats such as HTML, Markdown, and PDF reports.
  Instead of having to find data structures tacitly described in the application code, the creation of a database model helps to evaluate design options beforehand, think through the implications of different alternatives, and recognize potential hurdles before committing sizable amounts of development effort. A database model helps plan ahead, in order to minimize later rework. In the end, the modeling process accelerates development, increases quality of the application, and reduces execution risks.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Compare & Merge: improved message to clarify when no alter script is generated in delta model via CLI due to no changes impacting the database
  - ERDV: adapted all ERDVs to accurately reflect changes when an entity is moved to another container which is initially not present in the ERDV
  - ERDV: added adapter to redraw relationships based on shortest path between entities while keeping the anchor position on each entity boxes
  - Polyglot: added display of block and group custom properties for derived relationships
  - XSD reverse-engineering: set “resolve references” to true by default for Erwin source
  - Avro: added use of UDT technical name for schema forward-engineering when referencing UDT Enums
  - BigQuery, CockroachDB, Db2, Hive, MariaDB, MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, Redshift, SQL Server/Azure SQL, Synapse, Teradata, YugabyteDB: added possibility for views to be based on another view (not just on a table)
  - PostgreSQL: added support for single unique constraint options in the alter script of delta models
  - SQL Server/Azure SQL: removed extraneous space in comment formatting of DDL forward-engineering
  - Snowflake: extend ability to select more file extensions (.pem, .p8, .crt, .cert) when setting up key-pair authentication
  - Snowflake: added more user-friendly message in case of missing or invalid passphrase when setting up key-pair authentication
  - Synapse: removed extraneous ASC keyword in generated script
  - Synapse: added reverse-engineering of (composite) Unique Key constraints
