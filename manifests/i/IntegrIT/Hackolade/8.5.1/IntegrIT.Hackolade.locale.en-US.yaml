ShortDescription: Polyglot Data Modeling for SQL and NoSQL databases, APIs, and storage formats
Description: |-
  Hackolade Studio is an intuitive yet powerful application to perform the visually data modeling and schema design of many SQL and NoSQL databases, APIS, and storage formats.
  Hackolade Studio combines the graphical representation of collections in an Entity Relationship Diagram, with the graphical representation of the JSON Schema definition of each collection in a hierarchical schema view. Together, these graphical representations provide the schema model for data-at-rest and data-in-motion, plus the documentation of that model. The application is specifically designed around the powerful nature of JSON nested sub-objects and denormalization.
  The software facilitates the work of, and the dialog between analysts, architects, designers, developers, testers, DBAs, and operators of systems that are based on such technologies. It also can generate schema scripts and documentation in a variety of machine-readable formats (DDLs, JSON Schema, Avro, Parquet, Protobuf, ...) as well as database instances, or human-readable formats such as HTML, Markdown, and PDF reports.
  Instead of having to find data structures tacitly described in the application code, the creation of a database model helps to evaluate design options beforehand, think through the implications of different alternatives, and recognize potential hurdles before committing sizable amounts of development effort. A database model helps plan ahead, in order to minimize later rework. In the end, the modeling process accelerates development, increases quality of the application, and reduces execution risks.

  - ERD Display Options: added keeping toolbar menu open after selection, until mouse is moved out of the fram
  - Object Browser: added option in contextual menu to sort ERDVs alphabetically
  - Compare & Merge: removed extraneous Relationships tab in lower half of screen, as information is available in more details in upper half
  - Compare & Merge: enhanced filter "Show only differences" to hide unchanged group properties in lower half of screen
  - Compare & Merge: added collapsing of unchanged group properties, when filter set to "Show all properties"
  - Documentation: added tolerance during generation for missing references to external definitions
  - Polyglot: added possibility to define UDT so that it could be derived in CockroachDB, PostgreSQL, and YugabyteDB physical models
  - Windows installer: enhanced to provide alternative installation folder and avoid that privileges force Inno Setup to install in AppData, plus updated for Windows 10+ and x64 compatibility
  - Workgroup: pass the matching repository root folder when retrieving stashes and tags
  - Oracle: added fallback query to fetch table columns meta information without SELECT permission
  - PostgreSQL: added support for column-level check constraints
  - PostgreSQL:  introduced flexibility in script generation for controlling constraints in CREATE scripts (3 choices: "In CREATE statement", "In separate statement" or "Ignore"), controllable from Tools > Options > Forward-Engineering parameters, plus from forward-engineering lower tab and via Tools > Forward-Engineer menu
  - YugabyteDB: removed enum, composite, range and domain data types from the data type list to enforce user-defined types for proper declaration in generated scripts
