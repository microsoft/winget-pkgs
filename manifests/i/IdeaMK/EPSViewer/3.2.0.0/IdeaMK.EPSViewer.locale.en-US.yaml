  EPS Viewer is a free for use software tool.

There are two types of EPS file. One type is a vector based graphics file that can be opened and easily edited in any vector based programs. Second type is EPS photo file, flattened, set resolution "picture" type file. Second type can be opened in Photoshop or other program for image editing.

  There are several drawing programs and vector graphic editing applications that supports EPS file extensions and these file are usually used as a standard means for transferring image data between different operating systems (Windows, Linux, MAC OS).
  EPS Viewer despite converting in other file formats, it supports resizing of EPS image. EPS file contains instructions for creating lines, points, areas and colors. This is very important because with this, EPS images can be resized (enlarged or reduced) without losing any quality.
