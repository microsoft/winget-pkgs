ShortDescription: A program for calculating, comparing and plotting thermophysical properties of secondary refrigerants.
Description: |-
  SecCool is a program for calculating, comparing and plotting thermophysical properties of secondary refrigerants.
  SecCool is a package of programs consisting of three parts:
  - SecCool Properties. Program with user interface, allowing to calculate fluid properties with different concentrations, calculating friction and pressure drops in secondary side piping systems, and comparing different fluids.
  - SecCool Datafit. Program for adding new secondary refrigerants to the package
  - SecCool API. Two Windows 32-bit and 64-bit DLLs which can be used in your own programs, one DLL specifically for EES (Engineering Equation Solver, by F-Chart Software), and one general-purpose DLL.
  The SecCool package is developed as part of the project DESIK (Energirigtig design og regulering af sekundærsiden på indirekte køleanlæg med naturlige kølemidler) financed by ELFORSK R&D (#334-001). The project period was from 2003-04-01 to 2005-12-31. Maintenance and hosting of the project since then has been done by IPU.
