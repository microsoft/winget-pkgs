ShortDescription: A simulation tool for calculating and comparing yearly energy consumption of refrigeration and heating systems.
Description: |-
  Pack Calculation Pro is a tool to guide investment decisions for commercial/industrial refrigeration systems, as well as heat pumps.
  Whether you are retrofitting an existing refrigeration or heating system, or creating a new system from scratch, Pack Calculation Pro can provide a thorough comparison of different solutions.
  You can compare different system designs, refrigerant choices and control strategies/settings based on yearly energy consumption, cost (Life Cycle Costing), and global warming impact (Total Equivalent Warming Impact) – and of course on ability to deliver the cooling/heating demand every hour of the year.
  We kick-start your calculations by reducing the amount of data you should provide, among others by using load profiles and weather data to calculate the performance. We select well-proven default values for most coefficients and parameters, while allowing you to customize these defaults, import your own cooling/heating load profile data, to meet your specific needs.
  Our comprehensive database of commercially available compressors, maintained in cooperation with OEMs, makes it possible to compare performance of different products using a single definition for the operating conditions.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Ejector cycles:
    - Dimensioning of vapour ejectors, low-pressure-lift and high-pressure-lift.
    - Major improvements to all ejector cycle calculations.
  - Rating points UI:
    - State point diagrams, table and log(p)-h diagrams fully implemented for most cycles. Supporting flooded evaporators.
    - Log(p)-h diagram shows all available properties at mouse cursor position.
  - Refrigerant data:
    - R290 (propane) data updated, to allow operating at high condensing temperatures in heat pumps.
