ShortDescription: Provide remote desktop support or access unattended computers.
Description: ISL Light enables you to remotely control Windows, Mac and Linux computers, as well as various mobile devices, over the Internet. Provide fast remote support to your clients or access your unattended computers, even behind a firewall or a NAT proxy. While you do not need authentication to join an existing session, you do need a valid ISL Online account to initiate a new remote desktop session.

  New Features
  Default dashboard tab now set to “Last active tab” by default
  In the previous version of ISL Light, we introduced a new setting under the Default Dashboard configuration, which determines which tab is shown after logging in. The setting, called Last Active Tab, ensures that if users exit the application while on the Computers tab, the same tab will be shown upon relaunching and logging in. The same behavior applies if the Session tab was active before closing the application. This option is now the default value for the Default Dashboard setting.
  Add SNI support for AutoTransport in permissive SSL mode
  The AutoTransport methods wsstun-direct, wsstun-proxy, https-direct, and https-proxy were updated to include Server Name Indication (SNI) during the SSL handshake.
  This change improves compatibility with third-party load balancers such as Cloudflare, which rely on the hostname being sent as part of the handshake.
  Update to mbedTLS 2.28.10
  The internal mbedTLS library has been updated to version 2.28.10.
  Upgrade to libdatachannel 0.22.6 and libjuice 1.5.9
  We upgraded libdatachannel to version 0.22.6 and libjuice to version 1.5.9.
  Bug Fixes
  Multiple monitor button behavior
  An issue was identified when using the multiple monitors feature (opening each remote monitor in a separate view). Although separate views were created, the monitor selection was incorrect—view one would select monitor 1, but view two would show the entire desktop. This functionality has been redesigned to correctly assign each view to the respective remote monitor.
  Monitor shortcuts not working with multiple monitor views
  In case users used multiple monitors functionality ( each remote monitor in it’s own view ), the monitors shortcuts did not work. Support for monitor shortcuts was added, so users are now able to switch between monitors also when they are using multiple monitors functionality.
  Always enable TLS for AT MUX channels
  Previously, some MUX channels were not protected by a TLS session. TLS is now always enabled for all MUX channels.
  Change dots to underscores for filename on Linux
  In previous versions, Linux filenames used dots as delimiters in the version string. This caused an issue when the build number was below 10, as Linux systems sometimes interpreted the file as a manual page and opened it in a text editor. Filenames now use underscores instead of dots, ensuring the application always starts correctly.
  Incorrect copyright
  When checking the file properties of the downloaded ISL Light application, users would see incorrect copyright information. This issue has been resolved. The application’s details now correctly display XLAB d.o.o. as the copyright.
  One-time password prompt appearing incorrectly
  If ISL AlwaysOn was configured to support both one-time password and native-only authentication (e.g., Windows, macOS, or Linux account passwords), ISL Light would incorrectly show a one-time password prompt—even when native-only authentication was active. The connection prompt has been redesigned to hide the one-time password input in such cases.
  Removed “Verify your email” screen during signup
  Previously, after clicking the Sign up button in the ISL Light application, a browser would open, and ISL Light would display a “Verify your email” screen. This intermediate screen has been removed. Now, clicking Sign up simply opens the signup page in the browser, while ISL Light remains on the login screen.
  Fix icon copy in secure part on macOS
  On macOS, resources could be injected in a way that caused copying to the destination folder to fail. This occurred because the operation was appended in the unsigned part of the package. It is now allowed in the signed part, enabling proper execution in the unsigned portion.
  Other fixes and improvements
  Bug fixes, security updates, missing translations, and other general improvements.
