ShortDescription: Easily create reports based on account information downloaded daily from Isabel 6.
Description: |-
  With Isabel Offline Reporting (IOR) your company or organisation can count on a very advanced reporting solution for your Isabel 6 electronic banking.
  Research has demonstrated that, from a customer's point of view, the local storage of account information is one of the major benefits of IBS5 (Isabel Business Suite 5.0, the predecessor of Isabel 6). Due to this local information storage, quick searches can be made and detailed reports can be generated. To facilitate the change to Isabel 6 and to guarantee the excellent performance and continuity of your reports, Isabel makes an offline reporting program available.
  Isabel Offline Reporting stands for a state-of-the-art reporting program with the same functionalities (and more) than reporting in IBS5.
