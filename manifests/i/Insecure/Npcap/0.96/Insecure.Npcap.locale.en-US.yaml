ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Set the *IfType, *MediaType, and *PhysicalMediaType registry values for the
    Npcap Loopback Adapter. The values set should reduce the amount of configuration
    that Windows attempts to do on the adapter, preventing it from being labeled
    "Unknown Network."
  - Record the ID of the Npcap Loopback Adapter in the registry when creating it,
    instead of only in the installer. This allows users to remove and create the
    adapter with NPFInstall directly, without requiring a reinstallation of Npcap.
  - Expand the Npcap public license to allow 5 installations rather than only 1.
  - Fix memory layout and accounting when writing Radiotap headers in raw 802.11
    monitor mode. Fixes #1001, #1028, and #1036.
