ShortDescription: Redirect any Windows/MacOS TCP and UDP traffic to HTTP/Socks5 proxy
Description: ProxyBridge is a lightweight, open-source universal proxy client (Proxifier alternative) that provides transparent proxy routing for applications on Windows and macOS. It redirects TCP and UDP traffic from specific processes through SOCKS5 or HTTP proxies, with the ability to route, block, or allow traffic on a per-application basis. ProxyBridge fully supports both TCP and UDP proxy routing and works at the system level, making it compatible with proxy-unaware applications without requiring any configuration changes.
