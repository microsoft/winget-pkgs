ShortDescription: Redirect any Windows/MacOS TCP and UDP traffic to HTTP/Socks5 proxy
Description: ProxyBridge is a lightweight, open-source universal proxy client (Proxifier alternative) that provides transparent proxy routing for applications on Windows and macOS. It redirects TCP and UDP traffic from specific processes through SOCKS5 or HTTP proxies, with the ability to route, block, or allow traffic on a per-application basis. ProxyBridge fully supports both TCP and UDP proxy routing and works at the system level, making it compatible with proxy-unaware applications without requiring any configuration changes.

  ℹ️ Platform Updates
  Linux support postponed. Linux support was initially planned for this release but has been postponed due to significant development challenges. Implementing feature parity with Windows and macOS requires substantial architectural work and effort. After initial development attempts encountered multiple technical issues, we decided to focus on stabilizing the Windows and macOS versions first. Linux support remains in our roadmap, but no release timeline has been finalized. See commit 6dfed95 for details.
