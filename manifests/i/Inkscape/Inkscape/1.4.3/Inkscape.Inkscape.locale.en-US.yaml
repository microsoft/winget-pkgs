ShortDescription: A professional vector graphics software which runs on Linux, macOS and Windows desktop computers.
Description: |-
  Inkscape is a Free and open source vector graphics editor for GNU/Linux, Windows and macOS. It offers a rich set of features and is widely used for both artistic and technical illustrations such as cartoons, clip art, logos, typography, diagramming and flowcharting. It uses vector graphics to allow for sharp printouts and renderings at unlimited resolution and is not bound to a fixed number of pixels like raster graphics. Inkscape uses the standardized SVG file format as its main format, which is supported by many other applications including web browsers.
  It can import and export various file formats, including SVG, AI, EPS, PDF, PS and PNG. It has a comprehensive feature set, a simple interface, multi-lingual support and is designed to be extensible; users can customize Inkscape's functionality with add-ons.
  The Inkscape project has a growing international user community, and many learning materials exist to help get you started with your creations. Help and support is provided by the community, and there are lots of ways for you to get involved if you want to help improve the Inkscape project.
  Inkscape is a member of the Software Freedom Conservancy, a US 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. Contributions to Inkscape are tax deductible in the United States.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Inkscape 1.4.3 is maintenance and bugfix release, which brings you fixes for many critical or irritating bugs, and even a few new features.
  It is also a bridge release in the sense that it can be used to convert the planned Inkscape 1.5 multipage file format to the pre-1.5 multipage format. Versions lower than Inkscape 1.4.3 will not be able to interpret pages created in Inkscape versions 1.5 and upwards. Opening a document in Inkscape 1.4.3 and saving it will convert it to the current ('old') page format (MR #7608).
  Background: While the 'old' format of pages in Inkscape is a custom addition that only works in Inkscape, the new format will make use of the svg:view element, which is standardized and can work in other SVG viewers, too. Find more information about this in MR #7525.
  The most important fixes and changes in this release are:
  - 24 crash/freeze fixes many of which prevented users from opening certain files or exporting certain objects with Inkscape 1.4.2
  - almost 100 bug fixes and small improvements, among them:
    - JPEG/JPG export works again on Windows.
    - The problem with user interface text showing up as rectangles ('tofu') instead of letters if certain fonts are installed on macOS is finally resolved.
    - Ungrouping big groups is faster again.
    - All pasting options ('on page', 'width'/'height'/'size'/…) are now accessible from the right-click menu on canvas.
    - The Measure tool snaps again at its end point, so you can make accurate measurements again.
    - The LPE dialog now offers to convert Line, Polyline or Polygon SVG objects to paths before applying a path effect to them
    - When resizing the Inkscape window, the buttons in the Commands bar (copy, paste, open, dialog shortcuts) show up one by one instead of waiting for the window to get big enough to show the second half at once.
    - When converting strokes to paths, patterns and gradients are no longer lost.
    - Aligning on a circle or arc now works more reliably.
    - Text on Path now also works with rectangles.
    - Many improvements have been made to the PDF import.
    - Results from path operations no longer end up at the bottom of the object stack unexpectedly and the Split Path operation has learnt to better handle nested shapes.
    - The current layer by default is now the one where you have last selected an object (might need a preferences reset to apply).
    - Whether the current page is changed when you select an object on it has been made optional.
    - You can now make small changes to how Inkscape looks without needing to modify the full theme file.
    - The bug that sometimes made it impossible to make gradients and patterns fully opaque has been prevented from reaching adulthood (it has been around since 2007!).
  - and 25 updated interface languages as well as 13 updated documentation languages!

  Known Issues
  If you're experiencing a crash when dragging a dialog tab on Linux while using Wayland, you can work around that by starting Inkscape with the command GDK_BACKEND=x11 inkscape. Learn more
  If certain PDF files crash Inkscape when trying to load them, you can try to workaround the issue by downloading Inkscape 1.4.2 and using that to open and convert them to SVG before working with them. Learn more
