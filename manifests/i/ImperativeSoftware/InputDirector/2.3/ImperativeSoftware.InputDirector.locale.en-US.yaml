ReleaseNotes: |-
  Input Director v2.3 is available for download.
  New features include:
  - Profiles - A profile encapsulates the client systems, their configurations, and the monitor layout. Profiles are useful for many different situations, such as:
  - Using the same computer across different locations, each with their own set of computers
  - If one or more computers alternate between a varying number of connected monitors
  - If a monitor is shared between two computers, different profiles can be configured and assigned hotkeys to quick switch between them
  - Quick switch between profiles from the ID context menu, by hotkey or via the new command line tool
  - Auto switch between profiles when the number of monitors connected to the Director changes
  - A new command line tool makes it easy to query and drive Input Director directly or via a script
  - Command line integration can be disabled from the Security tab in the application
  - If using monitor numbers when editing a system's monitor layout, Input Director will display each monitor number on the monitor
  - A What's New window will pop-up once with information on the latest release when upgrading
  - Defaulted applying the Windows enhanced pointer precision setting, when directing clients, to false on new installs
  - Fixed bug that could block transitions in the corners of a screen
  - Input Director will now notify when disabling itself due to remote desktop being active and display options to re-enable or change its behaviour
  - Upgraded OpenSSL library to v3.3.1
  - Minor bug fixes
  I'd like to thank all the volunteers for kindly giving their time to beta test v2.3, including Clifton, tongshinboan, Stormy, Steve Rumsby, Suresh, Jeff R., et. al
