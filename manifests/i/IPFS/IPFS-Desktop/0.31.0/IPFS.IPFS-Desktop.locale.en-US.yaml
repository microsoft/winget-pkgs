ShortDescription: An unobtrusive and user-friendly desktop application for IPFS on Windows, Mac and Linux.

Use IPFS Desktop to get acquainted with IPFS without needing to touch the terminal â€” or, if you''re already experienced, use the powerful menubar/taskbar shortcuts alongside the command line to make your IPFS workflow faster.'
