  ðŸš¨ Improved gateway error pages with diagnostic tools
  Gateway error pages now provide more actionable information during content retrieval failures. When a 504 Gateway Timeout occurs, users see detailed retrieval state information including which phase failed and a sample of providers that were attempted:

  - Enhanced error details: Timeout errors now display the retrieval phase where failure occurred (e.g., "connecting to providers", "fetching data") and up to 3 peer IDs that were attempted but couldn't deliver the content, making it easier to diagnose network or provider issues.
  - Retry button on all error pages: Every gateway error page now includes a retry button for quick page refresh without manual URL re-entry.
