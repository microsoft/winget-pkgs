  Highlights
  🧊 Updated Kubo
  See Release Notes for Kubo v0.39.0 for the full list of changes, key highlights below:

  ⚡ Share Files Instantly
  Previously, after adding files to IPFS Dsktop, it could take 30+ seconds before friends could find and download them. Now, when you add files or folders, they become discoverable on the network almost immediately (typically under a second).
  This means you can share a link right after the upload finishes and it will just work.
  🔌 Your Node Stays Reachable After Router Restarts
  Home routers occasionally restart or lose their settings. Before, this would silently break your node's connectivity, forcing you to restart IPFS Desktop manually.
  Now, IPFS Desktop automatically recovers its network port settings when your router comes back online. Your node stays reachable without any intervention.
  📡 Smarter Content Announcements
  The way your node tells the network about your files has been redesigned. The new "sweep" system:
  - Uses less memory and bandwidth, less likely to kill your inexpensive router
  - Announces content at a steady pace instead of bursts that could slow down your internet
  - Remembers progress between restarts, so it picks up where it left off instead of starting over
  This is especially helpful if you're self-hosting a lot of files on a regular home internet connection.
  🎨 Updated WebUI
  The Web UI has been updated to v4.10.0.
  Fixed: Diagnostics logs now show full details
  The Diagnostics screen introduced in v0.46.0 had a bug where log entries were missing important details.
  This is now fixed - what you see in the WebUI matches what you'd see running ipfs log tail directly.
