ReleaseNotes: |-
  This release focuses on speed, reliability, and giving you more control over your workflow.
  ⚡ Performance Boost
  We’ve made major performance improvements throughout Loop, making everything feel faster and more responsive.
  📥 Drag & Drop Emails
  By popular demand, we’ve added drag-and-drop support in the middle view.
  🪟 Open Threads in a Popup
  Double-click on any thread in the middle view to open it in a separate window — perfect for multitasking and working across multiple conversations at once.
  ✂️ Improved Copy/Paste
  We’ve enhanced copy and paste functionality in the composer for a smoother editing experience.
  You can also now copy just parts of an email subject — or the whole thing — with ease.
  📝 Edit Contact & Hide/Show
  You can now edit contact details directly and easily hide or show contacts as needed.
  ⚠️ Sync Warnings
  We’ve added clear warnings if there are any issues with syncing, so you’ll always know when something needs your attention.
  🛑 Upcoming Deprecation
  In the following weeks, versions 7.4.x and older will be deprecated.
  We strongly recommend updating to ensure the best performance and full feature support.
  ⬅️ Need to roll back?
  If you have any issues with this version, you can download the previous one here —
  but not before you reach out at support@intheloop.io or from within the app 😉
