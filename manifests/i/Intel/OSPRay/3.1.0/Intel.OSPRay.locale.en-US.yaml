ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Principled and Luminous materials support emissive textures
  - Add native support for disc and oriented disc geometry
  - Add support for mirror repeat and clamp to edge texture wrap modes
  - GPU device now also supports motion blur
  - Improve noise in reflections of ThinGlass
  - Improve adaptive accumulation: working with GPU, fix correlations
  - Fix indirectly seen albedo and normal buffer
  - Fix artifacts when using specular texture for Principled
  - Fixes for PixelFilter
      - Parameter was ignored (always using the default Gaussian)
      - Avoid a shift/misalignment within the pixel for first sample
  - Fix empty image on Windows when focusDistance=0
  - Fix missing SDK headers for ISPCDevice*
  - The new minimum versions of dependencies:
      - Embree v4.3.1
      - Open VKL v2.0.1
      - Open Image Denoise v2.2 (better quality with fine details, support AArch64 CPU on Linux)
      - ISPCRT v1.23.0 (uses environment variable ISPCRT_GPU_DRIVER to select GPU to run on when multiple (i)GPUs are present)
      - rkcommon v1.13.0 (fixes crash using GPU and emissive geometry)
