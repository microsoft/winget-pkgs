ShortDescription: A gaming performance overlay and telemetry application to monitor and measure your gaming experience.
Description: |-
  PresentMon is a set of tools to capture and analyze the high-level performance characteristics of graphics applications on Windows.
  PresentMon traces key performance metrics such as the CPU, GPU, and Display frame durations and latencies; and works across different graphics API such as DirectX, OpenGL, and Vulkan, different hardware configurations, and for both desktop and UWP applications.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  New Features
  Enhancements
  - Implemented paced playback of ETL files from the service, allowing the service to process ETL files at realtime cadence
  - Added automated test that uses paced ETL playback to test dynamic metric polling API
  - Enhanced the flash injection to maintain a connection with the injected code and update settings in realtime
  - Added a rainbow bar option for flash injection to help identify frames
  - Added the ability to size the flash injection background independent of foreground flash rectangle
  - Added the ability to run PresentMon client headless via CLI to perform .csv frame captures
  - Added CLI option to list/browse available stats, metrics, and devices
  - Enhanced cooperation between clients in multi-client scenarios (telemetry and ETW flush periods)
  - Added the ability to capture ETL trace logs from PresentMon client UI (experimental, primarily for issue reporting)
  - Enabled logging up to verbose level in production without requiring special build parameters (also added new Verbose2 level)
  - PresentMon Installer upgrade fixes to allow for better upgrade experience and silent installations
  - Enhanced PresentMon console ULT suite

  Metrics
  - MsBetweenSimulationStart - BETA support - Enabled but still ironing out some issues.
  - MsPCLatency - BETA support - Enabled but still ironing out some issues.

  Bug Fixes
  - Fixed injection sometimes skipping drawing flash when clicking rapidly
  - Fixed bug in Streamer component (IPC ring buffer) that could lose frames in rare circumstances
  - Enhanced present event processing in CompletePresent when handling lost presents.
  - Fixed frame type bug when processing composed presents
  - Fixed small error in overlay AnimationError calculation.
