ReleaseNotes: |-
  New Features
  - Overhauled the ETW backend to reduce event latency from 1000ms => ~30ms; overlay now displays data instantly without 1 second lag
  - Added a new click-to-photon metric that only tracks mouse button events; renamed previous click-to-photon metric to "all-input-to-photon"
  - Improved input latency reporting so that input falling on dropped frames is attributed to the next displayed frame rather than being ignored
  - Enabled the client to gather log data from the service and increased log coverage, particularly at the "debug" severity level

  Bug Fixes
  - Fixed column labels for summary stats file #330
  - Fixed rare crash due to a race condition #340
  - Fixed bug occurring when selecting a non-default adapter #256
