ReleaseNotes: |-
  New Features
  - Added frame generation tracking support for Intel XeSS XeFG and AMD Fluid Motion Frames. The Displayed FPS metric now tracks both application and generated frames in the FPS calculation. In addition PresentMon will report the type of frame using the FrameType metric.
  - Added support for Intel XeLL and introduced a new metric called Instrumented Latency, which uses driver-based markers to accurately represent latency from frame start to when the frame is on the display.
  - Added ability to configure service logging via registry
  - Added Animation Time metric which is the time the CPU started animation work on a frame

  Bug Fixes
  - Fixed issue where PresentMon would fail initialization the first time it is run after reboot
