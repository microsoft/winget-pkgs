ShortDescription: A DNS forwarder
Description: |-
  mosdns is an extensive DNS forwarder. Users can customize their DNS handling logic on demand.
  mosdns comes with:
  - Matcher:
    - Match request pattern: domain, type, source IP, etc.
    - Match response pattern: response IP, CNAME, etc.
  - Functions:
    - UDP, TCP, DoT, DoH (H3 supported), DoQ Client and Server.
    - Cached responses (ECS not supported).
    - Automatically determines if a domain name is a dual-stack domain and then blocks IPv4/6 requests without affecting pure IPv6/4 domains.
    - Append preset ECS to requests.
    - Modify the TTL of the response.
    - Set IP for the domain name.(hosts)
    - Return a response with a specific IP. (blackhole)
    - Replace (redirects) the requested domain name. Requested domain A but return a record for domain B. (redirect) (redirect)
    - Manually construct a response containing arbitrary records. (arbitrary)
    - Countercheck a mosdns-processed domain name with an IP. This can be done in response to a PTR request or through the HTTP interface. (reverse_lookup)
    - Dynamic routing: Write response IPs to ipset and nftables.
