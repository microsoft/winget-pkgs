ReleaseNotes: |-
  ✅ Increased max log size from 150MB to 1GB (there is also rotation so we can store until 2GB).
  ✅ Fix a bug that caused some files and folders from not being deleted.
  ✅ Fix a bug that was causing a folder to not being created. If a folder existed previously in that path we couldn't create it again.
  ✅ Add a retry wrapper to all requests. Now, if a request has a network error or a 429 error retry until the request can be made or if it has a server error 5XX, retry 3 times. The delay between requests is multiplied by 2. First, 5s, then 10s, and so.
  ✅ Remove duplication of requests. When the same request is made multiple times reuse the same request to make the application more performant and reduce the server workload.
  ✅ Add abort to requests and handle successfully the response.
  ✅ Improve and simplify the way we upload moved files.
