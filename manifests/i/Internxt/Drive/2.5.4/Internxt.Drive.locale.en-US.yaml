ReleaseNotes: |-
  ✅ Manage server and network issues: For a more reliable application, we've started handling request issues differently depending on their cause. For example, when it's a network issue, we create an issue in "Settings" -> "Issues" to let the user know there's a connection problem.
  ✅ Fix for device creation: Related to the above, we were ignoring the type of error that occurred when trying to create a new device (it could be our fault or a network issue), which could result in duplicate devices. We now only create a device when necessary and ignore duplicate devices due to network or server issues.
  ✅ Issue if the file is too large: We've now added an issue in "Settings" -> "Issues" when trying to upload a file larger than 20 GB to backups.
  ✅ Cache: We've added a caching library to the UI (@tanstack/react-query) to start delivering a smoother, more performant experience in the UI.
  ✅ Antivirus progress fix: Fix a bug that caused the anitivirus progress to go above 100%.
