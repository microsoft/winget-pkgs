ShortDescription: With IBM Aspera you can transfer files from web apps or directly through this app once you connect your IBM Aspera servers to it.
Description: |-
  Aspera for desktop is a transfer client that powers high-speed file transfers between your computer and Aspera transfer servers. When used with a website that is integrated with Aspera, Aspera for desktop allows you to start uploads and downloads directly from the browser.
  Does your company use Aspera?
  Once you downloaded and installed Aspera for desktop, you are ready to get started. Open a web browser of your choice and navigate to your company's website that integrates with Aspera. The desktop app seamlessly integrates with websites and allows you to perform high-speed file transfer directly through your browser. Follow the instructions provided on the website to start transferring files.
  Why do I need to use a desktop app to transfer files?
  Users that are familiar with Google Drive or Box might be used to downloading and uploading files directly in the web browser without the need for a separate desktop application. However, web browsers are limited in the functions they provide for file transfers and often result in slow transfers and poor performance.
  When integrating with Aspera, websites are able to offer users faster file transfers regardless of file size or physical distance. While Aspera does offer install-free solutions, the Aspera desktop app provides users with the best end to end high-speed file transfer experience. Additionally, the desktop app provides these features:
  - High-speed file transfer
    Reliably and securely transfer large files or directories at maximum speed regardless of network conditions or physical distance.
  - Manage transfers
    View past history and current transfer progress with the ability to pause and resume transfers. When used with Shares, the desktop app lets users transfer shared files faster and more reliably.
  - Remotely view and manage content
    Sign in to your IBM Aspera on Cloud (AoC), IBM Aspera Faspex 5, or IBM Aspera High-Speed Transfer Server (HSTS) accounts directly from the desktop app to browse and manage your account content.
  - And much more!
