  PVRTexTool gives you a wide array of tools and features for pre-processing your textures for efficient rendering, giving you more time to make your textures look as good as they should.

  PVRTexTool supports all core texture formats in Vulkan, OpenGL ES, and DirectX 11.1 as well as the PVR format, optimised specifically for PowerVR hardware.

  PVRTexTool is able to output to PVR, KTX, KTX2, ASTC, and DDS files, giving it a wide range of compatibility with most graphics applications. This lets it slide easily into your workflow, regardless of what youâ€™re working on. In particular is our PVR format, which not only has a fully public specification, but also supports custom metadata and even comes with optimised resource-loading code available as part of the SDK Framework.
  
  Compressing your textures is as easy as a few clicks and gives you full control thanks to your limitless range of options, including but not limited to: PVRTC, ASTC, ETC, BASISU, and DXT/BC.

  As well as compressing your textures for memory-optimal usage, PVRTexTool also comes with a plethora of processing options for working with textures:
  - MIP map generation
  - Normal map generation
  - Texture arrays
  - Font-to-texture generation
  - Border generation and colour bleeding
  - Cubemap generation
