Description: |-
  PVRCarbon gives developers deep insight into how their application behaves by recording, playing back, and analysing their application’s graphics API usage.

  By capturing the OpenCL, OpenGL ES, and Vulkan API calls made by an application, users can see exactly where bugs or errors in their system comes from, backed up by our static analysis, frame debugging, and C++ export features. These can then be exported and played back on any other compatible device, allowing for multi-platform testing and debugging with ease.

  The PVRCarbon GUI remote recorder allows you to capture an application’s API calls without having to install any libraries or edit configuration files. Simply connect to the device over USB or via local network, and recording can be started and stopped on-demand, over any number of frames, letting you control exactly what gets captured, meaning you can isolate and determine the cause of any issues.
