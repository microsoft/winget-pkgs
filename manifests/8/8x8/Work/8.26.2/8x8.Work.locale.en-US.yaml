ReleaseNotes: |-
  With version 8.26, we’ve introduced new enhancements that make calling more flexible, improve accessibility, and enhance overall usability—especially for users without 8x8 Meet access.
  Expanded conference calling access
  - Users without an 8x8 Meet license can now initiate conference calls directly from the desktop app. Broader collaboration is now possible without requiring additional licenses.
  Improved accessibility
  - Screen reader support has been enhanced in 8x8 Frontdesk and general areas, offering a smoother experience for users who rely on assistive technologies.
