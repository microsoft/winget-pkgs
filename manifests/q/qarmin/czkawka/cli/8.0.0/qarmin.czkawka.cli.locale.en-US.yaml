  Legend:
  - libraw in name - app is compiled with libraw feature and require libraw package sudo apt install libraw on ubuntu
  - heif in name - require libheif-dev to be installed to be able to read use heif images
  - gui - gtk version of app
  - cli - command line version of app
  - krokiet - slint version of app
  - console - windows version, that shows console in background - usable to find problems
  - gtk_46, gtk_410 - gtk version used to build
  - minimial appimage - this version does not contain gtk-related libraries and they are taken from the system, so it has requirements almost identical to the regular version. Use only if you have problems with the regular version or know what you are doing
  - winversion, linversion - the application has been compiled on Windows or cross-compiled on Linux. Both versions should work exactly the same, but the Windows version requires the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable package to be installed (it should be already installed on most Windows OS)
  Other:
  - Snap builds are not available, due error during build Environment validation failed for part 'czkawka': 'cargo' failed with error code 1.
  - Mac heif builds are also not available, due linker problem - https://github.com/qarmin/czkawka/actions/runs/11186720416/job/31102310566
