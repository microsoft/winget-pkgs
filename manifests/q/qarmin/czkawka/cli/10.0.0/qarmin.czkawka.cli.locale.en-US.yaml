ReleaseNotes: |-
  Version 10.0.0 - 18.08.2025r
  Breaking changes
  Users
  - Some languages now have unified names in Crowdin (e.g. es → es-ES). The GUI may not find them and will fall back to the default language.
  - Cache files now use memory limits and are incompatible with previous versions.
  - Cli image filter argument changed from faussian to gaussian
  Devs
  - stop_flag is now required argument in most of the core functions
  - Visibility of some core functions has been reduced to pub(crate)
  - The modules in czkawka_core have been split and reorganized a bit — imports need to be adjusted, although the actual behavior and item names should not be changed too much

  - Replaced println/eprintln with logging functions - #1478

  External
  - There is a new unofficial Tauri-based frontend for Czkawka - Czkawka Tauri
  - Czkawka 8.0.0 is now available in Debian Sid - Cli/Gui Gtk
  CI
  - Compilation for 32-bit targets is now checked in CI
  - Czkawka binaries are now checked for reproducibility in CI
  Prebuilt binaries
  - AppImage binaries are no longer provided due to random bugs (not present in other packaging formats) and minimal added value compared to prebuilt Linux binaries or Flatpak
  - HEIF Mac binaries are now provided
  - CI now builds Linux binaries on Ubuntu 22.04 instead of 20.04(github removed 20.04 images)
  - musl builds of czkawka_cli are now provided instead of eyra builds (slightly easier to maintain). GUI builds are not included due to limitations of musl and eyra :(
  - Prebuilt Windows console binaries are no longer provided — logs are now saved to a file, which is easier to read than terminal output
  - Skia opengl and vulkan backends are provided for Krokiet on Linux(no binaries on Windows, because don't know how to replace sed)
  - Prebuilt binaries are now build with lto fat instead lto thin and codegen-units=1 to greatly reduce binary size(~25% smaller binaries)

  Legend:
  - If you are a beginner and don't know which version to use, start with one of these depending on your OS (if they don’t work, try different builds):
    - Windows – windows_krokiet_on_linux, windows_czkawka_gui_gtk_46
    - Mac – mac_krokiet_x86_64, mac_krokiet_arm, mac_czkawka_gui_x86_64, mac_czkawka_gui_arm
    - Linux – linux_krokiet_skia_opengl_x86_64, linux_krokiet_x86_64, linux_czkawka_gui_x86_64
  - krokiet – graphical version of the app (recommended over the GTK version)
  - gtk_gui – graphical GTK version of the app
  - cli – command-line version of the app
  - gtk_46, gtk_412 – GTK versions used to build the Windows app. On some systems gtk_46 works, on others gtk_412, so choose the one that works on your computer.
  - arm, x86_64 – CPU architecture. Most Windows/Linux uses x86_64, while on Mac the arm version is becoming the most common choice. (To run the app, you need to use the correct one.)
  - heif, raw, avif – additional features that require extra libraries installed on the OS
  - skia_opengl, skia_vulkan – alternative Linux backends for Krokiet; may fix some issues like blurry fonts
