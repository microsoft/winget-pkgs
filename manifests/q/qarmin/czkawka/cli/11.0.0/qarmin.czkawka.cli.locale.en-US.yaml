ReleaseNotes: |-
  Version 11.0.0 - 14.02.2026r
  Breaking changes
  Users
  - The Czkawka GUI config file was migrated from a custom, broken format to JSON. All settings must be configured again. The old TXT file is not removed and can be used as a reference.
  - In broken files mode, file type is no longer stored in cache. Existing cache files are incompatible with this version and will be automatically regenerated.
  - The Similarity Preset enum in similar images mode was replaced with an integer argument Max Difference in range 0-40.
  - HEIF images are now rotated only once instead of twice. Existing cache may contain incorrectly rotated images and should be regenerated by removing cache(but this requires manual intervention).
  Devs
  - Public API functions were slightly adjusted to avoid unnecessary cloning and referencing of copyable types.
  - Similarity variables were renamed to Difference.
  - Applications must call register_image_decoding_hooks(); at startup to enable reading HEIF and JXL images.

  - Krokiet Windows binaries with the Skia backend are now available, this only works with MSVC build and requires Visual C++ Redistributable
  - Intel Mac binaries are now built with the latest available macOS version, currently 15
  - Windows prebuilt binaries now bundle libEGL and libGLES, which fixes issues running GTK 4.12 builds on some systems, GTK 4.6 builds are no longer provided
  - Krokiet macOS OpenGL binaries are deprecated due to outdated and broken Apple OpenGL drivers, Skia Vulkan binaries are now provided and recommended
  - Some Linux binaries are now built on Ubuntu 24.04 to support a newer libheif-rs with improvements, including reading images with pixel formats other than rgb8

  Legend:
  - If you are a beginner and don't know which version to use, start with one of these depending on your OS (if they don’t work, try different builds):
    - Windows – windows_krokiet_on_linux, windows_czkawka_gui_gtk_46
    - Mac – mac_krokiet_skia_vulkan_x86_64, mac_krokiet_skia_vulkan_arm64, mac_czkawka_gui_x86_64, mac_czkawka_gui_arm64
    - Linux – linux_krokiet_skia_opengl_x86_64, linux_krokiet_x86_64, linux_czkawka_gui_x86_64
  - krokiet – graphical version of the app (recommended over the GTK version)
  - gtk_gui – graphical GTK version of the app
  - cli – command-line version of the app
  - gtk_46, gtk_412 – GTK versions used to build the Windows app. On some systems gtk_46 works, on others gtk_412, so choose the one that works on your computer.
  - arm, x86_64 – CPU architecture. Most Windows/Linux uses x86_64, while on Mac the arm version is becoming the most common choice. (To run the app, you need to use the correct one.)
  - heif, raw, avif – additional features that require extra libraries installed on the OS
  - skia_opengl, skia_vulkan – alternative Linux backends for Krokiet; may fix some issues like blurry fonts
