ReleaseNotes: |-
  Added
  - VS Code: You can now make quick-lint-js messages fun and insulting with the quick-lint-js.snarky setting (disabled by default). (Implemented by vegerot.)
  - Using Greek question mark (;, U+037E) instead of a semicolon (;, U+003B) now reports [E0457][] ("this is a Greek Question Mark, not a semicolon (';')"). This diagnostic is also reported for similar-looking characters like ǃ (which should be !) and ﴾ (which should be ().
  - TypeScript: Decorators on abstract classes are now parsed. (#1194)
  Fixed
  - TypeScript: (): RT<T>=>null (with no spaces in >=>) now parses correctly. (Fixed by vegerot.)
  - Fixed E0718 falsely diagnosing valid code. (#1192, #1199)
  - quick-lint-js no longer crashes in the presence of symbolic links and directory junctions on Windows. (#1182)
  - Fixed a read buffer overflow (possibly leading to a crash) when checking whether short identifiers containing Unicode escape sequences are keywords. (x86 and x86_64 only.) (#1191)
