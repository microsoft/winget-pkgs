ReleaseNotes: |-
  qBittorrent v5.0.1 was released.
  Libtorrent 1.2.x users who stuck with it due to memory usage issues, you might want to try the libtorrent 2.0.x variant and change the disk IO type to the new option "Simple pread/pwrite". Memory usage issues should be eliminated with it. More info in PR #21300.
  WINDOWS: If you like a native UI look and feel and don't care about dark mode use the System Qt style in the Settings (Behavior category). If you want the best possible dark mode support use the Fusion Qt style (it should be the default already).
