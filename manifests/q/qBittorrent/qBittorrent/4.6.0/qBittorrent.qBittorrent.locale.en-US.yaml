ReleaseNotes: |-
  qBittorrent v4.6.0 was released.
  A lot of work has been done for version 4.6.0. The changelog below includes the most notable changes for end users along with the author for each change. Also, I want to thank all the users, like thalieht and xavier2k6, who constantly help with testing PRs and doing bug triaging.
  WINDOWS: Only Windows 10+ is now supported.
  SECURITY NOTICE: WebUI users YOU MUST change the default Webui credentials (aka "adminadmin") when exposing the WebUI to the Internet. There are reports(1, 2, 3, 4) that this is possibly exploited in the wild. This will be remedied in a followup release where the default credentials will be disabled and a credentials change will be forced.
  macOS: Builds are self-signed now. It should help with macOS permissions dialogs.
