Description: |-
  Before sharing sensitive and/or confidential files from your NAS, use File Station to encrypt them into .qenc files. Recipients can then decrypt these files using the QENC Decrypter. Only those with the password will be able to decrypt, view, and use the encrypted files.
  Files that have been encrypted and compressed using Hybrid Backup Sync can also be decrypted and decompressed using the QENC Decrypter.
