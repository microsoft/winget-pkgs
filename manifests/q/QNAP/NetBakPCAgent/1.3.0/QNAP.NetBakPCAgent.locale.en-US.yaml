ReleaseNotes: |-
  [Important Notes]
  - NetBak PC Agent has been renamed to HDP PC Agent. This name change is part of a unified naming strategy across QNAP's backup product line and reflects the product's alignment with the HDP (Hybrid Data Protection) ecosystem. Existing features or configurations are not affected.
  - Older versions of the operating system require manually installing .NET Framework 4.7.2.
  [New Features]
  - HDP PC Agent can now be deployed across multiple PCs that use Windows AD GPO.
  - Settings for performing full backups have been added to backup schedule settings and include flexible weekly and monthly scheduling options and backup failure behavior options.
  - The UI has been comprehensively improved with a new look & feel, more streamlined navigation, and increased overall usability.
  [Enhancements]
  - Windows backups now consume less storage without any loss of data integrity or restore reliability. Note: certain system files are now excluded from snapshots.
  - Added an option to automatically wake up a sleeping PC at a scheduled time so that HDP PC Agent can complete backup jobs.
  - If logging into a NAS which is in a high availability cluster, HDP will automatically redirect you to login to the cluster IP (CIP), making the login process more convenient and improving job continuity after a switchover.
  [Fixed Issues]
  - HDP PC Agent now successfully connects to the NAS without showing errors even if the Bareos configuration file on the PC is corrupted.
  - HDP PC Agent now successfully connects to the NAS when the PC contains a faulty hard drive.
  - HDP PC Agent no longer fails to sometimes backup the C: volume with the error “Failed to synthesize the backup volume”.
  - Fixed issues that occur when creating HDP PC Agent boot drives and improved error handling during the USB drive preparation step.
  - Improved handling when backing up PCs whose volumes contain partial cluster damage, reducing unexpected backup failures.
  - The HDP PC Agent app now displays a helpful error message when the application opens informing Windows domain users that they do not have the required Windows permissions to run HDP PC Agent.
  - Fixed several issues involving network connection and backups, improving overall job stability.
