The Windows version provides “Storage Plug & Connect” functionality, allowing the QNAP NAS to be used as a PC network drive or virtual disk for convenient data storage. You can also use the "Media Upload" feature to save NAS system resources by performing media file transcoding on your local PC before uploading them to the NAS.
