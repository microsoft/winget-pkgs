  Improvements
  - Positions in reads that do not match the reference in read mappings are displayed using the defined mismatch colors at all zoom levels, rather than just when zoomed in.
  - Data downloaded from an AWS S3 bucket via a CLC Server AWS Connection using the "Download and Save..." option in the Remote Files tab can be  downloaded to a CLC Server location or to disk (a CLC Server import/export directory). Previously such downloads could only be saved to a CLC Server location.
  - Using the right-click "Upload to This Folder" menu option in the Remote Files tab, data for upload to AWS S3 buckets can be selected from CLC data locations and the local file system. When logged into a CLC Server with one or more valid AWS Connections, data for upload  can also be selected from CLC Server locations, and, when an AWS Connection configured on the CLC Server is selected, data can also be uploaded from CLC Server import/export directories. Previously data could only be selected from CLC data locations.
  - Improvements made to better support licensing handling for CLC Workbenches run on hardened Linux environment where execution in TEMP is not allowed.
  - Various minor improvements
  Bug fixes
  - Fixed an issue where BLAST at NCBI could fail if the 'Mask low complexity regions' option was unchecked.
  - The background color of the 3D Molecule Viewer can again be specified in the Side Panel settings when working with a Molecule Project. This setting was absent in CLC Genomics Workbench 25.0 and 25.0.1.
  - Fixed a bug where table rows removed from a selection could be silently added back into the selected set if the table was subsequently sorted based on column values.
  - Fixed an issue affecting the second or subsequent use of Associate Data Automatically when associating data with rows of a CLC Metadata Table using the Prefix or Suffix matching scheme. If no changes were made when launching Associate Data Automatically the second or subsequent time in a given Workbench session, the "Exact" scheme was used instead of the selected scheme. The first use of this functionality was unaffected by this problem.
  - Various minor bugfixes

    - CVE-2025-21502
