ReleaseNotes: |-
  Improvements
  - The ClusteredNR peptide database is available to search using BLAST at NCBI.
  - Various minor improvements
  Bug fixes
  - Fixed an issue in Detect and Refine Fusion Genes where reads were incorrectly discarded during the refinement step in cases where an exon flanking the breakpoint was the same length or shorter than the "Breakpoint distance" specified for the analysis. The default distance is 10. This fix leads to an increase in fusion crossing reads and 5'/3' read coverage for affected exons. The issue was most likely to impact fusions with novel exon boundaries.
  - Fixed an issue where Structural Variant Caller for Long Reads could report the sequence of an insertion inaccurately, where the start of the insertion was most impacted. Affected sequences were supported by only a small fraction of reads, and were most likely to be observed in noisy, high-coverage datasets.
  - Fixed an issue causing QC for Sequencing Reads to fail when the input contained a very small number of long sequences, relative to the total number of sequences in the analysis, and the only output from the analysis was the supplementary report.
  - CVEs fixed in this release include:
    - CVE-2025-30749
    - CVE-2025-50106
    - CVE-2025-24855
    - CVE-2025-27113
    - CVE-2025-30754
    - CVE-2025-50059
    - CVE-2025-30761
    - CVE-2025-48924
    - CVE-2025-49128
    - CVE-2025-52999
    - CVE-2025-25193
    - CVE-2025-24970
  Reference data related
  - Macaca fascularis T2T-MFA8v1.1 was made available for download using Download Genomes in CLC Genomics Workbench 25.x on July 9, 2025.
  - Effective July 16, 2025, Download Pfam Database downloaded Pfam 37.4. That update affected downloads using this version and earlier versions of the software.
  Changes
  The bundled Java version is Java 21.0.8, where we use the JRE from the Azul OpenJDK builds.
  Advanced notice
  - Correct Long Reads (legacy) will be retired in a future version of the software.
  - The policy property ‘run_on_workbench_when_server_is_available’ will be retired in a future release. Please use the workbench_save_to_server policy instead.
