ShortDescription: Hosts network licenses for QIAGEN CLC applications
Description: |-
  The CLC Network License Manager hosts network licenses for QIAGEN CLC applications.
  Network licenses are checked out when client software starts running, and are checked back in when the software is closed. This allows a single license to be used on different machines at different times. For modules (commercial plugins), a network license is only checked out at the time the first tool delivered by that module is launched in a given Workbench session. If people wish to run a licensed application while offline, they can borrow a license for a certain period of time.
  Access to and reserving of licenses for particular users or machines can be configured, as can the maximum number of licenses that can be used by certain users, groups, or sets of machines, and the maximum length of time a license can be borrowed.
  Network licenses are required if the CLC software is installed on systems with more than 64 cores, or if the software will be accessed remotely
