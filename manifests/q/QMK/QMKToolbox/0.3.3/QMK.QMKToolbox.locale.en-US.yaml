ReleaseNotes: |-
  Important Note for Windows Users
  dfu-programmer v1.0.0 has dropped support for libusb-win32 (libusb0) in favour of libusb-1.0. As such the driver installation has been updated to designate WinUSB for Atmel DFU bootloader devices. You may need to manually uninstall the libusb0 driver for existing bootloaders on your machine.Important Note for macOS Users
  Although the Toolbox itself will run on Apple Silicon Macs, the flasher binaries are still Intel-based and do not work. Installing Rosetta may help, but this has not been tested.
  - [Windows] Fixed bug where some USB devices would not be detected properly (#476)
  - [Windows] Improved extraction of flasher binaries (#478)
  - Downgraded avrdude to 7.0 due to issues on Windows (#475)
  - Refactored HID Console code to allow for Raw HID device detection (#473)
