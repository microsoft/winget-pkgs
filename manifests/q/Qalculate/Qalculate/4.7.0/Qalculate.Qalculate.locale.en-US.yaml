ShortDescription: A highly versatile desktop calculator, with support for units, physical constants, uncertainty propagation, symbolic calculations, etc.
Description: |-
  Qalculate! is a multi-purpose cross-platform desktop calculator.
  It is simple to use but provides power and versatility normally reserved for complicated math packages, as well as useful tools for everyday needs (such as currency conversion and percent calculation).
  Features include a large library of customizable functions, unit calculations and conversion, physical constants, symbolic calculations (including integrals and equations), arbitrary precision, uncertainty propagation, interval arithmetic, plotting, and a user-friendly interface (GTK, Qt, and CLI).

ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Support for custom default angle unit, e.g. turn, arcsec, arcmin
  - Append default angle unit (instead of always radians) when converting value without unit to angle unit
  - More consistent addition and removal of angle unit from function arguments
  - Always interpret ./, .*, and .^ as entrywise operators if user intention is unclear
  - Change order of operations to place entrywise and ordinary operators on the same precedence level
  - Add function, kron(), for Kronecker product, and constants for Pauli matrices
  - Add radius to planets dataset and update other properties
  - Support replacement of unknown variables within variable values
  - Fix besselj(0, 0)
  - Fix incomplete calculation in tan() with try exact approximation
  - Fix 0/0=0 equality (do not return true) and output of 2/0 (and similar)
  - Fixes and improvements for newtonsolve() and secantsolve()
  - Fix segfault when MathStructure is deleted after Calculator, and in destructor of calculated DynamicVariable (called from Calculator destructor)
  - Do not save mode on exit if "-defaults" command line switch where used
  - Minor bug fixes and feature enhancements
