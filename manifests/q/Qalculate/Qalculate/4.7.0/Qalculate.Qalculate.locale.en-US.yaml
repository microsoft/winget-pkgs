ShortDescription: A highly versatile desktop calculator, with support for units, physical constants, uncertainty propagation, symbolic calculations, etc.
Description: Qalculate! is a multi-purpose cross-platform desktop calculator. It is simple to use but provides power and versatility normally reserved for complicated math packages, as well as useful tools for everyday needs (such as currency conversion and percent calculation). Features include a large library of customizable functions, unit calculations and conversion, physical constants, symbolic calculations (including integrals and equations), arbitrary precision, uncertainty propagation, interval arithmetic, plotting, and a user-friendly interface (GTK, Qt, and CLI).

# Agreements:
ReleaseNotes: |-
  Changes
  â€¢ Support for custom default angle unit, e.g. turn, arcsec, arcmin
  â€¢ Append default angle unit (instead of always radians) when converting value without unit to angle unit
  â€¢ More consistent addition and removal of angle unit from function arguments
  â€¢ Always interpret ./, .*, and .^ as entrywise operators if user intention is unclear
  â€¢ Change order of operations to place entrywise and ordinary operators on the same precedence level
  â€¢ Add function, kron(), for Kronecker product, and constants for Pauli matrices
  â€¢ Add radius to planets dataset and update other properties
  â€¢ Support replacement of unknown variables within variable values
  â€¢ Fix besselj(0, 0)
  â€¢ Fix incomplete calculation in tan() with try exact approximation
  â€¢ Fix 0/0=0 equality (do not return true) and output of 2/0 (and similar)
  â€¢ Fixes and improvements for newtonsolve() and secantsolve()
  â€¢ Fix segfault when MathStructure is deleted after Calculator, and in destructor of calculated DynamicVariable (called from Calculator destructor)
  â€¢ Do not save mode on exit if "-defaults" command line switch where used (CLI)
  â€¢ Allow multiple actions for keyboard shortcuts (GTK, Qt)
  â€¢ Add toggle precision, and min, max, or min and max decimals to available shortcut and button actions (GTK, Qt)
  â€¢ Add option to exclude units for unformatted ASCII copy (GTK, Qt)
  â€¢ Add optional value to copy result action, allowing expression copy and formatting selection (GTK, Qt)
  â€¢ Fix copy unformatted ASCII when local digit group separator is same as selected decimal separator (GTK, Qt)
  â€¢ Add option to automatically copy result (Qt)
  â€¢ Always set (primary) selection clipboard contents when whole expression is selected or selection is cleared, e.g. after calculation (Qt)
  â€¢ Improve support dark mode and high contrast modes, and change default style to Fusion, on Windows (Qt)
  â€¢ Minor bug fixes and feature enhancements
