ShortDescription: A highly versatile desktop calculator, with support for units, physical constants, uncertainty propagation, symbolic calculations, etc.
Description: |-
  Qalculate! is a multi-purpose cross-platform desktop calculator.
  It is simple to use but provides power and versatility normally reserved for complicated math packages, as well as useful tools for everyday needs (such as currency conversion and percent calculation).
  Features include a large library of customizable functions, unit calculations and conversion, physical constants, symbolic calculations (including integrals and equations), arbitrary precision, uncertainty propagation, interval arithmetic, plotting, and a user-friendly interface (GTK, Qt, and CLI).

ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Concise (e.g. "1.2345(67)") and relative (e.g. "5+/-2%") notation for output and input (disabled by default for concise notation) of interval
  - Optimize rest of unit expression when converting to partial (insufficient) expression (e.g. 18MA×100ns to J = 1.8 J/V)
  - Round high precision intervals enclosing integers for integer arguments
  - Add support for specifying position of sign bit in floating point functions
  - New derived units: Debye, C·m, Daraf, F^-1, V/C, N/C, kcal, kcal/g, kJ
  - Use international foot as base unit for rod
  - Fix fibonacci() for non-integers and recursive use
  - Fix unit matching for speed units (and possibly other)
  - Minor bug fixes and feature enhancements
