ShortDescription: A highly versatile desktop calculator, with support for units, physical constants, uncertainty propagation, symbolic calculations, etc.
Description: |-
  Qalculate! is a multi-purpose cross-platform desktop calculator.
  It is simple to use but provides power and versatility normally reserved for complicated math packages, as well as useful tools for everyday needs (such as currency conversion and percent calculation).
  Features include a large library of customizable functions, unit calculations and conversion, physical constants, symbolic calculations (including integrals and equations), arbitrary precision, uncertainty propagation, interval arithmetic, plotting, and a user-friendly interface (GTK, Qt, and CLI).

  Qalculate! is a multi-purpose cross-platform desktop calculator.

Features include a large library of customizable functions, unit calculations and conversion, symbolic calculations (including integrals and equations), arbitrary precision, uncertainty propagation, interval arithmetic, plotting, and a user-friendly interface (Gtk, Qt, and CLI).
  Changes:
  - New functions: reshape(), circshift(), replacePart()
  - Functions mergevectors() and area() renamed to slice() and part()
  - v[i, ...]=... syntax for assignment of part of matrix/vector variable
  - Improve language handling for functions, units, and variables
  - Limit the range of supported arguments in bessely, besselj, binomial, and igamma functions (to avoid segfault and very slow unabortable calculations)
  - Do not try to calculate exact result with automatic approximation for expressions with iterative functions
  - Fix compilation without Readline
  - Fix segfault with entrywise operation on column vector and an empty vector
  - Fix handling of single quotation marks
  - Fix use of options "ignore locale" and "language" in command line arguments
  - Option to change the default currency
  - Limit time used for dual calculation with time command line argument to same limit as without
  - Fix use of options "ignore locale" and "language" in command line arguments
  - Minor bug fixes and feature enhancements
