ShortDescription: A highly versatile desktop calculator, with support for units, physical constants, uncertainty propagation, symbolic calculations, etc.
Description: |-
  Qalculate! is a multi-purpose cross-platform desktop calculator.
  It is simple to use but provides power and versatility normally reserved for complicated math packages, as well as useful tools for everyday needs (such as currency conversion and percent calculation).
  Features include a large library of customizable functions, unit calculations and conversion, physical constants, symbolic calculations (including integrals and equations), arbitrary precision, uncertainty propagation, interval arithmetic, plotting, and a user-friendly interface (GTK, Qt, and CLI).

  Qalculate! is a multi-purpose cross-platform desktop calculator. It is simple to use but provides power and versatility normally reserved for complicated math packages, as well as useful tools for everyday needs (such as currency conversion and percent calculation). Features include a large library of customizable functions, unit calculations and conversion, symbolic calculations (including integrals and equations), arbitrary precision, uncertainty propagation, interval arithmetic, plotting, and a user-friendly interface (Gtk, Qt, and CLI).
  Changes:
  - Improve speed of sort(), rank(), and mode() functions (and other dependent functions)
  - Parse ± before implicit multiplication when not preceded by number (e.g. "7 km ± 5m")
  - Always consider x^(a + b) equivalent to x^a × x^b (fixes "x^(y + z) − x^y × x^z")
  - Simplify (x = a || x ≥ a + 1) and (x ≤ a || x ≥ a + 1), and similar, when x and a are integers (fixes "abs(x − 1) = abs(1 − x)")
  - Do not remove duplicate whitespace characters from text strings (in quotation marks)
  - Add exact values for multiples of pi/12 (15°) in sin() and cos(), and tan(7/12pin)
  - Fix floating point conversion when comma is used as decimal separator
  - Fix (almost) endless loop with increasingly complex equations in some cases when x + x^(1/a) is transformed to x = (b − x)^a)
  - Fix and improve function() function
  - Fix loading of approximate variable with both approximate and exact values (e.g. in vector)
  - Fix missing parenthesis for exact number shown as approximate in vector
  - Fix conversion to non-unit expression beginning with zero (when not before decimal separator) or minus
  - Fix exchange rates updated after calculation of expression with only one currency
  - Fix segfault in some corner cases when converting approximate units before uncertainty calculation
  - Fix crash on Windows during output of extremely small or large (> 10^323228497) floating point number
  - Remove intltool build dependency
  - Fix compilation with readline < 7.0 and mpfr < 4.0
  - Do not show calculate-as-you-type result for incomplete object name (e.g. "integ" interpreted as "int(e × g)")
  - Ellipsize large matrices and vectors when a subset of output, e.g. in a failed function, in qalc
  - Completion for commands and options
  - Do not show result for variable assignment when --terse and --file are used
  - Minor bug fixes and feature enhancements
