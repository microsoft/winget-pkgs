ReleaseNotes: |-
  It's been just about a year since the last stable release, 0.0.96.1, and so here comes new stable version. It's relatively modest on updates in Quaternion codebase but a lot has happened in the underlying library, libQuotient. In case you haven't seen the beta release notes, most prominent changes are laid out here.
  Dependencies
  Aside from the the toolchain requirements bumped up (as usual, if your compiler and standard library is no more than 1-2 years old it should work), this is the first stable release that requires Qt 6 - Qt 6.4 or newer, specifically. Quaternion also requires libQuotient 0.9.2 (the latest library release, as of this writing) or newer 0.9.x. Only most prominent changes brought in by the new library version are mentioned below; see release notes for libQuotient 0.9 and subsequent maintenance releases for other changes, and for details.
  Driven by libQuotient 0.9, Quaternion is now always built with E2EE; moreover, E2EE is always enabled at runtime, unlike 0.0.96 where you had to switch it on from the login dialog. Unfortunately, key verification is still not ready, and E2EE usability is increasingly limited in Matrix on unverified clients; hopefully, this feature will arrive in 0.0.97.1.
  Most of work in this release has been spent on porting and modernizing the code to Qt 6 and libQuotient 0.9, and so is not really visible. That said, visuals of the login dialog (since beta 2) and the room timeline were refreshed a bit. As always, feedback is welcome!
  Changes
  - See beta 2 release notes for changes introduced earlier
  - feature: E2EE is always on now (3bb54b1 by @KitsuneRal)
  - feature: Quaternion no more uses reply fallbacks (aka mx-reply tags) to show replied-to text; the actual event is loaded in-place instead, with a link to its original position in the timeline (first introduced in beta 2, further polished in 373fbd8 and 886337f by @KitsuneRal)
  - feature: the shuttle scroller has got a new look, and the scroll-to buttons are now shown as overlays on top of the scroller, shuttle or classic (#927 by @KitsuneRal)
  - feature: Forgetting a room from the room list now requires to confirm the action (#907 fixing #236 by @dymoksc)
  - feature: Room creation dialog now allows to remove invitees from the list, not only add them (#908 fixing #650 by @dymoksc)
  - feature: Tweaks and minor artefact fixes in the room timeline (#926 by @KitsuneRal)
  - change: Starting from 0.0.97, Quaternion uses a new application id: io.github.quotient_im.Quaternion - that is compliant with Flathub requirements for verification (#905 fixed by @KitsuneRal); see beta 1 release notes for the details
  Thanks
  @dymoksc has made his first two contributions in this release (#907 and #908) - thank you!
