ReleaseNotes: |-
  While it is mainly "just" a maintenance release for 0.0.97, it includes one major feature that was long missing: Quaternion can finally be verified as a proper E2EE device (f03ffd0 by @KitsuneRal). For now, you have to start the flow from Quaternion, the other way is not implemented yet; but it unblocks a bit more seamless usage of Quaternion in encrypted rooms. (The next major upgrade over this would be quotient-im/libQuotient#820 landing in libQuotient.) Other changes:
  - Using an unread-messages icon in systray when messages arrive and Quaternion is not an active window (#818 by @Tamaranch and 5844253, 778a181, ecda04a by @KitsuneRal)
  - The total number of loaded messages in the timeline, as well as the number of messages from the current viewport to the sync edge, are now displayed in the scroller area (c02c4b4)
  - Fix assertion failures (=crashes in Debug builds) on some images in the timeline (76fcc9a, fixes #934)
  - Reply timestamps are now shown next to the reply text, not above the replied-to text (f245fe8)
  - Even better blending of reaction buttons into the timeline (3097660)
  - As usual, smaller fixes and tweaks across the codebase, but this time also in some translated strings (translators, check out your languages in our Lokalise project)
  Unless mentioned otherwise, all changes are by @KitsuneRal.
  New Contributors
  Thanks to @Tamaranch for being patient enough with their first contribution (#818) - took me 2 years to integrate it!
