ShortDescription: A Qt-based IM client for Matrix
ReleaseNotes: |-
  - @rpallai for a few more improvements on the timeline
  - @shunf4 for the original drag-n-drop of files implementation
  - @chmeeedalf for fixing a crash on sending a pasted image
  - #851 (fixing @857) and #852, both by @rpallai, fix a few issues with selecting text in the timeline.
  - #854 by @rpallai, allows to choose whether you want to use plain-text pasting or rich-text pasting when you press Ctrl-V; the alternative mode is available via Shift-Ctrl-V.
  - #858 (fixing #830) - login sessions not marked for persistence through restarts are explicitly logged out at exit (assuming the exit is clean, not due to a crash), invalidating the respective access tokens instead of leaving them valid, even if orphaned.
  - #859 (fixing #820) - the external URL is now correctly shown when using the German translation.
  - #868 by @chmeeedalf (fixing #867) - images coming from, e.g., a web browser are correctly pasted as images rather than (ultimately empty, because of Matrix protocol restrictions) HTML.
  - 447d8ec adjusted the colours used in the timeline for state events to be more discernible.
  - #643 ported the timeline code to Qt Quick Controls 2, which is the only version of Qt Quick Controls available in Qt 6.
    As a side-effect of it, AppImages are now disfunctional due to a packaging issue (#876) - unless someone comes up and fixes that, the code in CI that makes AppImages for development builds will be removed sometime later in the year.
  - b655369 (fixing #688) makes sure to cancel a network request if it was waiting too long for a user confirmation on an SSL certificate warning; previously Quaternion tried to move on with the request although Qt has deleted the related objects, resulting in a crash.
  - 2c5c077 (fixing #881) and 1cb19b6 (fixed #849) addressed issues with rich text handling in the message input.
  - c7cffcca - instead of showing URLs for links and other supporting information for stuff in the timeline in the status bar, tooltips are used in most such cases now.
  - 96debe0c and 28eef67 (together fixing #787) introduced logging categories to Quaternion - in the same vein as in libQuotient that uses them since version 0.6 - README has the list of categories to filter.
    This helps, in particular, with avatar request logs that can be quite verbose.
  - 441d275 (fixing #711) removed heavy animation code that made scrolling with a mouse wheel a pain on some systems.
  - fe77c7 (fixing #529) adds ability to re-dock room and user lists from the menu, as it wasn't possible to re-dock it using the window system, e.g. on Wayland.
  - 7eac2e5 (fixing #777) - Quaternion now relies on libQuotient code to fetch member avatars for the timeline; as a result, room-specific member avatars are used in the timeline now, instead of global avatars taken from the user profile as it was before.
  - #889 (fixing #731) - Qt translations are now included in the macOS bundle generated by CI.
  - #891 (fixing #835) - Fixes and improvements around drag-n-drop of files and content onto the message input.
  - 4ce59f7e fixed a possible crash when switching rooms from different accounts
