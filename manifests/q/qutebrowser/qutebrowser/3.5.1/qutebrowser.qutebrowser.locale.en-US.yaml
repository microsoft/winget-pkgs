ReleaseNotes: |-
  Deprecated
  - QtWebKit (legacy) support got removed from CI and is now untested. If it breaks, it’s not going to be fixed, and support will be removed over the next releases.
  - Qt 5 support is currently still tested, but is also planned to get removed over the next releases. Same goes for support for older Qt 6 versions (likely 6.2/6.3/6.4 and perhaps 6.5, see #8464).
  Changed
  - Windows/macOS releases now bundle Qt 6.9.1, including many graphics-related bugfixes, as well as security patches up to Chromium 136.0.7103.114.
  Fixed
  - A bogus "wildcard call disconnects from destroyed signal" warning from Qt is now suppressed.
  - PDF.js now loads correctly on Windows installations with broken mimetype configurations.
  - A "Ignoring new child …" debug log message which got spammy with Qt 6.9 is now removed.
  - A unknown crash (possibly related to using devtools) due to weird (Py)Qt behavior now has a workaround.
  - No "QtWebEngine version mismatch" warning is now logged anymore with newer Qt 5.15 releases (but you should still stop using Qt 5).
  - The PDF.js version can now correctly be extracted/displayed with newer PDF.js versions.
  - The qute-bitwarden, -lastpass and -pass userscripts now properly avoid a DeprecationWarning from the upcoming 6.0 release of tldextract. The previous fix in v3.5.1 was insufficient.
