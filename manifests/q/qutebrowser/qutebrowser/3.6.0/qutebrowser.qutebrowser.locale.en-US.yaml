ReleaseNotes: |-
  Added
  - The :version info now shows additional information:
    - The X11 window manager / Wayland compositor name (mostly useful for bug/crash reports).
    - Loaded WebExtensions (partial support landed in QtWebEngine 6.10, no official qutebrowser support yet).
  - Support for hinting elements which are part of an (open) shadow DOM.
  Changed
  - The qutedmenu userscript now sorts history by the last access time.
  - Hardware accelerated 2D canvas is now enabled by default on Qt 6.8.2+, as graphic glitches with e.g. PDF.js and Google Sheets should be fixed nowadays. If you still run into issues, please report them and set qt.workarounds.disable_accelerated_2d_canvas to always to disable it again.
  - Changes to binary releases:
    - Windows and macOS releases are now built with Qt 6.10.0, which is based on Chromium 134.0.6998.208 with security patches up to 140.0.7339.207.
    - Windows and macOS releases are now built with Python 3.14.
    - Windows releases are now built on Windows Server 2022 (previously 2019), which might break compatibility with older Windows releases (untested).
    - If using mkvenv.py on Linux, note that Qt now requires glibc v2.34 (v2.28 previously). This is available down to Ubuntu 22.04 LTS and Debian Bookworm (oldstable), so this should not affect most users of desktop distributions.
  Fixed
  - Fixed crash if two new downloads start while a download prompt is already open (#8674).
  - Fixed exception when closing a qutebrowser window while a download prompt is still open.
  - Hopefully proper fix for some web pages jumping to the top when the statusbar is hidden (#8223).
  - Fix for the page header being shown on YouTube after the fullscreen notification was hidden (#8625).
  - Fix for videos losing keyboard focus when the fullscreen notification shows (#8174).
  - The workaround for microphone/camera permissions not being requested with QtWebEngine 6.9 on Google Meet, Zoom, or other pages using the new <permission> element now got extended to Qt 6.9.1+ as it’s still not fixed upstream. (#8612)
  - The package version for Jinja 3.3+ is now correctly displayed in :version.
  - Fixed crash with Qt 6.10 (and possibly older Qt versions) when navigating from a qute:// page to a web page, e.g. when searching on qute://start.
  - On Wayland with Qt ⇐ 6.9, EGL_PLATFORM=wayland is now set by qutebrowser to get hardware rendering. Qt 6.10 includes an equivalent fix (#8637).
  - Added workaround for per-domain User-Agent header not being used on redirects (#8679).
  - Added site-specific quirk for gitlab.gnome.org agressively blocking old Chromium versions (and thus QtWebEngine) (#8509).
  - Using :config-list-remove with an invalid value for the respective option type now corrently displays an error instead of crashing.
