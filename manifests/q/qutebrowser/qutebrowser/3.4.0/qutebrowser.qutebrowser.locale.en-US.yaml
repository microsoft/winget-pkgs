ReleaseNotes: |-
  Removed
  - Support for Python 3.8 is dropped, and Python 3.9 is now required. (#8325)
  - Support for macOS 12 Monterey is now dropped, and binaries will be built on macOS 13 Ventura. (#8327)
  - When using the installer on Windows 10, build 1809 or newer is now required (previous versions required 1607 or newer, but that’s not officialy supported by Qt upstream). (#8336)
  Changed
  - Windows/macOS binaries are now built with Qt 6.8.1. (#8242)
  - Based on Chromium 122.0.6261.171
  - With security patches up to 131.0.6778.70
  - Windows/macOS binaries are now using Python 3.13. (#8205)
  - The .desktop file now also declares qutebrowser as a valid viewer for image/webp. (#8340)
  - Updated mimetype information for getting a suitable extension when downloading a data: URL.
  - The content.javascript.clipboard setting now defaults to "ask", which on Qt 6.8+ will prompt the user to grant clipboard access. On older Qt versions, this is still equivalent to "none" and needs to be set manually. (#8348)
  - If a XHR request made via JS sets a custom Accept-Language header, it now correctly has precedence over the global content.headers.accept_language setting (but not per-domain overrides). This fixes subtle JS issues on websites that rely on the custom header being sent for those requests, and e.g. block the requests server-side otherwise. (#8370)
  - Our packaging scripts now prefer the "legacy"/"for older browsers" PDF.js build as their normal release only supports the latest Chromium version and might break in qutebrowser on updates. Note to packagers: If there’s a PDF.js package in your distribution as an (optional) qutebrowser dependency, consider also switching to this variant (same code, built differently).
  Fixed
  - Crash with recent Jinja/Markupsafe versions when viewing a finished userscript (or potentially editor) process via :process.
  - scripts/open_url_in_instance.sh now avoids echo -n, thus running correctly on POSIX sh. (#8409)
  - Added a workaround for a bogus QtWebEngine warning about missing spell checking dictionaries. (#8330)
