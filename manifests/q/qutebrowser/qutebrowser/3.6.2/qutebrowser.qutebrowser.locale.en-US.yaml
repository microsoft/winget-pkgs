  Changed
  - Windows and macOS releases now ship with Qt 6.10.1, which include security patches up to Chromium 142.0.7444.162.

  - The version info now includes the Wayland compositor name if wayland-client is available under a different name than libwayland-client.so (#8771).
  - The list of Chromium extensions in --version / :version now uses the correct Chromium data profile, also fixing a crash with Qt 6.10.1 (#8785).
