  What's Changed
  splash-40
  🚀 Features
  - Users can now create simple projects straight within QField!
  - Feature forms now have a “read” mode design when the form is not editing a feature maximizing readability
  - A brand new pie menu is available when tapping on the location marker offering shortcuts to key actions tied to positioning such as starting or stopping tracking sessions, locking the coordinate cursor or map canvas to the current position, etc.
  - A visual progress user interface appears when uploading QFieldCloud attachments.
  - Imported projects – from a URL, from a compressed ZIP sent via email or messenger, etc. – can now be converted into a cloud project directly within QField.
  - Project translations are now supported.
  - Online legend graphics for WMS and AMS are now display in the side dashboard’s legend area.
  - Copy/paste/cut operations on vector features across layers are now supported.
  - Polymorphic relationship support.
  ✨ Improvements
  - A refreshed user interface offers a less intimidating experience for newcomers as well as a more focused one for long-time users.
  - The feature form has received tons of improvement from unifying the looks of editing widgets across all of QField to adding visual hints of lesser known functionalities such as the ability to resize the form via header bar’s dragging.
  - The feature form has gained support for two additional widgets: the spacer widget and the color editor widget.
  - Jumping to your current location, re-centering on a vector layer feature, or going to a coordinate is now animated to provide users with greater spatial awareness.
  - A new infinity grid is visible where the map canvas has not yet had time to render.
  - Topological editing has been improved, with the ability to avoid overlap with geometries beyond the immediate neighbors of the feature being edited.
  - The project folder view now allows for images and PDFs to be manually deleted by users.
  - Averaged positioning and tracking sessions will reject bad accuracy readings when accuracy indicator’s requirement are enforced.
  - Tons of improvements on the cloud projects list screen including the ability to push changes and synchronize projects directly from the list and visual indicators showing pending changes yet to be pushed and available remote updates.
  🤖 Android improvements
  - The background positioning service will only be turned on when tracking sessions are active.
  🧩 Plugin framework
  - New set of APIs providing plugin authors with the ability to add new layers to the currently opened project as well as creating memory layers from scratch.
  - Map canvas’ Z range filtering now exposed to plugins.
  New Contributors
