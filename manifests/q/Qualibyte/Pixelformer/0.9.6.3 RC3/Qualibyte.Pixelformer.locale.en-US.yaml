ShortDescription: A bitmap editor specifically optimized for creating, modifying, and converting small and medium-sized images
Description: |-
  Pixelformer is a bitmap editor, specifically optimized for creating, modifying, and converting small and medium-sized images, such as icons, buttons, web graphics, sprites, etc.
  Pixelformer is faster, smaller, easier, more precise, and often more efficient than large bitmap editing tools; at the same time it is more powerful and less limited than classic simple icon editors.
  So you need to create, edit, crop, resize, or convert icons or other small images? Pixelformer can help. Even if you prefer a sophisticated high-end image editor for creating graphics, Pixelformer would be a useful tool for doing fast edits, final tweaks, conversions, and optimizations.
