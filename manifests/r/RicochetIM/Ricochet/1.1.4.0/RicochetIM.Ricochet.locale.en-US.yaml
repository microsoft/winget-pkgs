ShortDescription: Ricochet is an experimental kind of instant messaging that does not trust anyone with your identity, your contact list, or your communications.
Description: Ricochet is a peer-to-peer instant messaging system built on the Tor Network hidden services. Your login is your hidden service address, and contacts connect to you (not an intermediate server) through Tor. The rendezvous system makes it extremely hard for anyone to learn your identity from your address.
