ReleaseNotes: |-
  We’ve made it easier to collaborate with your teammates — even if they’re not using Spark. Here’s what’s new:
  - Shared Accounts with Office 365 and Outlook: Now you can collaborate with your team using the accounts you already rely on.
  - Slack integration: Keep your teammates in the loop without leaving Spark. Share important emails as links with our Slack integration.
  - Plenty of under-the-hood fixes and improvements. They’re certainly smaller, but no less mighty.
  As always, if you have any questions or feedback, reach out at support@sparkmailapp.com.
