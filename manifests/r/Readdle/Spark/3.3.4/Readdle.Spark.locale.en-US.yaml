  Good news, everyone! The next update is here:

  - You can now drag and drop priority emails to other folders in the sidebar. This makes sorting through emails and organizing them much more efficient and intuitive
  - We've added a zoom option to Spark, making it easier for you to read and interact with content, no matter your vision needs.
  - We know how important it is to be able to quickly and easily send emails, so we've added support for 'mailto:' links and the 'make as default mail app' option.
  - Fixed various bugs and stability issues.

  If you need us, you can find us at support@sparkmailapp.com
