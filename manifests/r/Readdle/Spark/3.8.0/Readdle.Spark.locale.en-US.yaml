  Introducing a fantastic update with a long-wished-for feature – Templates!
  Draft. Save. Reuse.
  Spark simplifies the entire process with Templates, saving time and allowing you to communicate with confidence. Say goodbye to repetitive typing or copying from old emails. Your templates are saved and synced across all your devices, ensuring accessibility and consistency wherever you go.

  Moreover, our Templates are supercharged with AI.
  Use +AI to draft new email templates faster and beat writer’s block. Refine the phrasing, eliminate mistakes, and adjust the tone.
  What’s more, when replying to emails, +AI will adapt a template to match incoming email content.
