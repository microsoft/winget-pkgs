ReleaseNotes: |-
  This update includes:
  - Improved calendar sync on desktop: Spark now properly syncs actions from the web version of the calendar, ensuring a smoother experience across devices.
  - Better composer shortcuts: Fixed an issue where actions and shortcuts wouldn’t work if the composer wasn’t in focus. Now, shortcuts like Send work seamlessly without requiring extra clicks to refocus.
  - Fixed UI issues: Resolved flickering in Split View and fixed an issue where To/CC/BCC fields were reset when applying an email template.
  - Shared Inbox & navigation fixes: "Assigned to me" emails now appear in the Unified Inbox, and closing the calendar returns you to the correct email account.
  - Additional bug fixes and improvements: Various optimizations, including correct username updates for team accounts and eliminating endless loading when assigning emails.
