  You asked for it, and we delivered! Spark Desktop now has major improvements to folder management, making organizing your emails easier and more intuitive than ever. You'll find significant updates to the sidebar and Command Center.
  Improved Sidebar Organization
  - Clearer Hierarchy: Your main account in the sidebar now displays a nested folder structure, making it much easier to see your folders and subfolders at a glance.
  - Starred Folders: Star important folders (and their subfolders!) to pin them to the top of your sidebar for quick access.
  - Automatic Sorting: Folders are now sorted alphabetically for effortless organization.
  Faster Folder Navigation with the Command Center
  - Jump to Folders: You can quickly navigate to any folder using the shortcut Ctrl + G (Windows).
  - Recent Folders Memory: Spark now remembers your recently selected folders when moving emails, saving you time and clicks.
  - Improved Folder Path Display: Long folder paths are now shortened in the middle (instead of the end) for improved readability.
  You can also now choose the language for the +AI Summary in the popup window. It will automatically use the same language as your email, but you can change it before generating the summary. Additionally, you can remove and rename contact suggestions. We've also redesigned the Settings for better readability and easier, faster navigation.
  - Resolved an issue where long contact names in emails grouped by sender would disrupt the split view layout at the minimum width of the mail list.
  - Enhanced the Drag and Drop (DnD) functionality within the sidebar for a more intuitive user experience.
