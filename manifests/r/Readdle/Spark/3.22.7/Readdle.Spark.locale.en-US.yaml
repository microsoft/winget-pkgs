  We'd like to present some minor but mighty improvements to Spark.
  This update includes:
  - Added a shortcut for the fast switching to Meeting Notes in the sidebar: Ctrl+Shift+3.
  - +AI Translate (part of Premium): It now better detects and remembers the last translation language used, offering it as the default for subsequent translations.
  - Automatic calendar account detection when connecting to Google Meet from meeting pop-up.
