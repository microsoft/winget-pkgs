  We're excited to bring you the latest updates to Spark, designed to enhance your email experience.
  New Features:
  - Mention Recipients in Emails: You can now easily mention recipients directly within the body of your emails. Type "@" followed by the recipient's name to bring their attention to a specific part of your message. Spark will automatically add this email to the “To” field.
  - Reorder Templates: Organize your email templates to fit your workflow! In Spark Settings > Templates, you can now drag and drop to reorder your saved templates, ensuring your most frequently used ones are always at your fingertips.
  - Use System-Wide Shortcuts: Use your standard shortcuts for everyday actions: Print, Search, New Email.
  Resolved:
  - Drag-and-Drop Email Addresses: We fixed an issue where the email address was automatically copied when you dragged and dropped it into the To field.
