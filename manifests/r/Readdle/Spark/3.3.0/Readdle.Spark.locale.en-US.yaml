  Our salutations to everyone in 2023!
  We’re back to you with the first in this year update that is focused on new features and improvements to Spark:

  * Drag & Drop your way to a super organized mailbox - now you can easily move emails to the folders on the sidebar with a simple Drag & Drop.
  * Resize sidebar - you can now resize the sidebar to suit your needs.
  * Lookin’ good - we’ve added new backgrounds for Home Screen and replaced system dialogs with custom ones to make it more eye-pleasant.
  * Date-time rules - now Spark supports your local date format.

  Thank you to everyone who got in touch with us at support@sparkmailapp.com
