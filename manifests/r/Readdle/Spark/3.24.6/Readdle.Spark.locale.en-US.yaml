ReleaseNotes: |-
  We’ve made several enhancements to improve your experience in Spark.
  - Introduced Group by Domain: Premium users can now group all emails from the same company or service, no matter the sender. This is helpful for tracking emails from different teams, systems, or contacts under the same domain. To group emails, open an email, click the sender’s email address, and enable Group by Domain.
  - Added a pop-up message for Outlook accounts: If IMAP is disabled on your Outlook account, Spark now shows steps on how to enable it and set it up smoothly.
  - Improved composer tooltips: We’ve renamed the “Arrange text around an image” tooltips in the composer for better clarity when formatting your emails.
  - Added the Empty All button in the Blocked folder to permanently delete unwanted emails.
  - Improved how printed or exported emails as PDFs display attachments: Spark now shows if an email contains attachments and lists their filenames.
  - Calendar improvements: You can now copy all attendees in the event viewer and access Duplicate, Copy, and Paste options from the event menu for quicker event management.
  - Lots of improvements and fixes in the composer.
