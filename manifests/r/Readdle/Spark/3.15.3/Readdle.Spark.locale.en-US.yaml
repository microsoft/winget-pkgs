  Hello everyone,

  In this update we’ve made some improvements and resolved several bugs:

  New Feature – Search by Sender.
  You can now search by sender in the Contact popup, Application menu, and Command Center.

  Fixes and improvements:
  - Unresponsive App: We fixed an issue where Spark could become unresponsive when interacting with specific emails.
  - Japanese and Chinese Comment Truncation: Fixed a bug that caused comments to get cut off when sending messages in Japanese or Chinese, instead of letting users switch between character types.

  Thank you for choosing Spark! We value your feedback. Please contact us at support@sparkmailapp.com with any questions or suggestions.
