  Hey everyone!
  There’s more than meets the eye in today’s small, yet mighty update to Spark:

  - Improved mini-calendar with clearer highlighting of current day and easier selection of month and year
  - The "Meet with..." feature now displays available slots for the entire week, with an updated design for a more cohesive look.
  - The "Meet with..." feature is now available in both Day and Month calendar views, offering broader usability.
  - Adjusted logic for calculating free time slots within the "Meet with..." feature
  - Updated the user interface for pending invitations to provide clearer status visibility.
  - Events now show a slight shift in creation date on the day view, enhancing timeline accuracy.
  - Fixed an issue where switching focus to another event preview while creating a new event could not cause an error.
