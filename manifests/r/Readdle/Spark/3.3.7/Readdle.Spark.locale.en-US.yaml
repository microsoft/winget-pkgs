  Hello everyone:

  - We just wanted to give you a quick heads-up that we've disabled the Winter backgrounds on Home Screen. While we loved the cozy vibes they brought during the holiday season, we figured it's time to give Spring a warm welcome with new exciting updates that will be delivered very soon!

  if you have any questions or suggestions, please, drop us a line at support@sparkmailapp.com
