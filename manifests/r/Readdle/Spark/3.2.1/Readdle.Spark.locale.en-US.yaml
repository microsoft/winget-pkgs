  Hey there!

  Last week we delivered the major update and today’s version has been polished to a fare-thee-well bringing with it a small number of important fixes:
  - Some AZERTY shortcuts didn’t work as expected, now they do.
  - Fixed several nasty bugs related to the new sidebar including some small design tweaks.
  - Fixed some localization issues.
  - Tons of tiny improvements and stability fixes.

  Thanks for your continuing feedback. We love hearing from you!
