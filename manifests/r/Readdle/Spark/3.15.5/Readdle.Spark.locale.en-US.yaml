  Hello,
  In this update we've made some improvements and resolved several bugs:

  Spark +AI Fixes:
  - Reduced AI token consumption in the 'My Writing Style' logic.
  - We addressed AI response issues, including incorrect references to previous correspondence and generating responses on behalf of the recipient instead of the sender.
  - Fixed an issue where the AI would rephrase the original email instead of creating a new reply.
  - Fixed a bug where AI ignored specific prompts.
  - Resolved an issue where AI added an extra signature when composing a new email.

  Thank you for choosing Spark! We value your feedback. Please contact us at support@sparkmailapp.com with any questions or suggestions.
