  Your Spark Team is back to you!

  Before the final rush of the season we wanted to provide you with one more update that brings a few long-waiting-for features, extra bug fixes, and performance improvements:
  - We reconsidered our approach to how you work with the sidebar and added some tweaks there. Now you can stick your sidebar and make it permanently visible for faster navigation across folders. Moreover, we added a neat vertical panel where you can pin the most usable folders without the need to keep the sidebar always open.
  - Old but gold. Added the print email feature. We know this feature is essential for many businesses so we tried to deliver it as fast as possible.
  - Added some scam protection. Now you can see the authentic web addresses while hovering on links in emails.
  - Added AZERTY and DVORAK keyboard layouts, so you can use the shortcuts with ease.
  - Numerous bugs and stability improvements.

  Thanks for your continuing feedback. We love hearing from you!
