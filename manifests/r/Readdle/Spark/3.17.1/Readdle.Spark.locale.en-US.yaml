  Hey everyone,

  We’re excited to introduce the new Meet with feature, now available in Spark Premium for Google Calendar accounts on Spark Mac and Windows platforms.

  What is “Meet with”?
  “Meet with” is a powerful tool that allows you to effortlessly find available time slots for appointments by searching across the calendars of all potential attendees. This feature extends the default Spark calendar functionality, making it easier than ever to coordinate meetings and events.

  Key Features:
  * Cross-Calendar Availability Search: Quickly find overlapping free time slots across the calendars of all meeting participants.
  * Seamless Integration: Works seamlessly with Google Calendar accounts, provided the calendars have been shared with you or the participants are part of your organization (work, school, etc.).
  * Enhanced for Teams: Ideal for scheduling within teams or organizations, ensuring everyone’s availability is considered.

  Thank you for choosing Spark! We value your feedback. Please contact us at support@sparkmailapp.com with any questions or suggestions.
