ShortDescription: Sky Simulator for Radio Astronomy
Description: |-
  There are dozens of good sky viewing programs for optical enthusiasts, but until now there has been a lack of modern sky viewing software for radio astronomy enthusiasts. Radio Eyes is not just a typical sky viewer that has mappings for radio objects. It is a tool to help you plan and execute your radio observations. Some of the features include:
  - RADEC and Dome type sky views.
  - Customizable catalogues of radio objects.
  - Separate pulsar catalog.
  - Load background maps for various frequencies.
  - Customize labels for presentation graphics.
  - Antenna beam object.
  - Develop drift scan tables.
  - Track objects.
  - Create active content from internet sources.
  - Switch to the views from other observatories.
  - Plot JPL Ephemeris data.
  - Show planets, stars, constellations.
  - Antenna positioning support.
  - Control your radiotelescope remotely.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  In addition to a number of bug fixes, this update has two
  new/improved tools under the Tools menu.

  The Fringe Calculator has significant updates.  It now works for
  calculating either object declination or fringe period. Two new
  plots are available.  Plot Fringe vs Declination gives you a
  look at how these parameters relate. Plot Fringe Pattern
  produces a graph of how the relative intensity of a signal
  changes during meridian transit. Plots are available for
  Phase Switched or Adding type instruments.

  A Dispersion Measure (DM) calculator has been added.  Given
  upper and lower frequencies and the time delay of signal
  appearance between them, DM is calculated. Also the
  expected delay for a given DM may be computed.

  A catalog of FRBs (fast radio bursta) from the CHIME group
  is now included.

  I am aware that some of the included Active Label files
  (.rls), no longer function due to website changes on
  their target URLs.  I am working on this.

  On Line Help has a new look.  Clear your old pages when
  using it.
