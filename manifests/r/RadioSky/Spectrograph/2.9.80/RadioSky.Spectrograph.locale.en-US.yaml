ShortDescription: Produce and View Radio Spectragrams
Description: Radio-Sky Spectrograph (RSS) is a free Windows program for recording and reviewing radio frequency spectragrams. RSS records consecutive snapshots of the power in each of up to 512 frequency channels. Data can be shared in real time over the internet or saved to disk for review. RSS can be connected to a number of different software defined radios (SDRs) by utilizing the appropriate intermediary programs. While originally written to support the Radio JOVE project below 30 MHz, this software can be used at any frequency your radio supports.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  This is an optional update

  This update fixes a number of bugs, especially
  in the drawing routines.

  ********Magnifier**********
  A magnifier option has been added and is available
  under the View menu item. If you use this option,
  it may request that you install the dot Net platform.
  Most will probably have this. If for any reason
  you wish not to install dot Net, don't use it.
  To configure the magnifier, right click on it.
  To capture a magnified image, point to it and
  type Alt+X to freeze the image, then right click
  on the image and select Save to a file or the
  Clipboard. Press Alt-X again to unfreeze. The
  magnifier is a seperate application and can be
  used without RSS.
