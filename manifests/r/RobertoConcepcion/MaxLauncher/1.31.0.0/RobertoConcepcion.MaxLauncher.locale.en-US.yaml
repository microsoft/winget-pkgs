Description: |
  MaxLauncher is a simple tabbed launcher that was designed to reduce the amount of time to find and run a program.
  It is capable of creating multiple data files, each of which can have a maximum of 10 tabs.
  Each tab and button is assigned a key(eg. F1-F10, 0-9, A-Z, etc.) based on the current keyboard.
  Simply press the hotkey (eg. CTRL+`) to activate the program then press the key that corresponds to the program you want to run.
  MaxLauncher is a redesign of MadAppLauncher.
  A few key features such as the ability to delete a tab, support for themes, and portable use were added.
