ReleaseNotes: |-
  Additions
  - Added a new mdbook to replace the previous github wiki. It can be found in here (CI added on #119)
  - Added better error message for when a script doesn't have proper permissions to be executed
  - Added resolution of shared groups between different dotfile profiles
  - Added missing functionality in tuckr unset. Wildcards are now properly handled and the command is aware of conditional groups
  Fixes
  - Fixed unsupported groups not being displayed with tuckr status <group> when the base group doesn't exist
  - Fixed regression causing tuckr init to never work
  - Fixed custom groups not being detected (#114)
  - Fixed from-stow unable to find dotfiles path and crashing when a dotfiles dir already exists
  - Fixed validation for config files being skipped when the target is a directory (#118)
  - Fixed --adopt removing the wrong file sometimes (#118)
  - Fixed regression causing shared directory resolution to be finicky
  - Fixed regression where base groups could no longer be used if related conditional groups existed
  - Fixed the way hooks are spawned on windows so they're more inline with how they work everywhere else
  - Fixed groupis command not working properly on windows
  - Fixed files outside of group directories in Hooks causing a panic
