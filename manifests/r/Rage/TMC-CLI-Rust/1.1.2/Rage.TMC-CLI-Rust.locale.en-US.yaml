ShortDescription: CLI for students using the TestMyCode programming assignment evaluator.
Description: TMC CLI Rust is a command-line interface for TestMyCode (TMC), a programming assignment platform used by University of Helsinki and other educational institutions. This Rust-based tool allows students to manage their programming exercises directly from the terminal. Features include logging into TMC servers, downloading course exercises, running tests locally, submitting solutions for grading, sharing code for review via pastebin, and updating exercises. The CLI supports automatic updates and offers interactive menus for selecting organizations, courses, and exercises. It replaces the older Java-based TMC CLI with improved performance and cross-platform support for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
