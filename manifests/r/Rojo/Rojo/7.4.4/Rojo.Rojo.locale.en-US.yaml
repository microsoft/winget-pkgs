ReleaseNotes: |-
  This release fixes a crash caused by a recent Roblox change and an edge case caused by setting Archivable to false for one Instance but not setting it for anything else.
  Changes since Rojo 7.4.3
  Fixes
  - Fixed an issue with reading recently generated Lighting files
  - Archivable is now set to true by default when building to binary (rbxm/rbxl) files, which fixes an edge case where it was set to false for one Instance but not set for anything else
