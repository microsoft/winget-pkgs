ShortDescription: BitTorrent streaming software with no paws in the way—watch anime in real-time, no waiting for downloads!
Description: |-
  A pure JS BitTorrent streaming environment, with a built-in list manager.
  Imagine qBit + Taiga + MPV, all in a single package, but streamed real-time.
  Completely ad free with no tracking/data collection.
  This app is meant to feel, look, work and perform like a streaming website/app, while providing all the advantages of torrenting, like file downloads, higher download speeds, better video quality and quicker releases.
  Unlike qBit's sequential approach, seeking into data that hasn't been downloaded yet will prioritise downloading that data, instead of simply closing MPV.
  Designed to be a similar experience to using a streaming website with functionality akin to MALSync and AniSkip.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  - fix: continue watching on startup
  - chore: macOS-specific wording
  - chore: bump webtorrent to v2.6.3
  - chore: add missing tags
  - chore: show and focus
  - chore: update kitsu URL
  - chore: significant caching improvement
    - Improves the performance when caching queries; previously, it would take well over 15 seconds to cache media, and even longer if the cache was larger.
    - Instead of fetching each key individually, we fetch the entire cache and compare.
