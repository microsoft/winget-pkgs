ShortDescription: BitTorrent streaming software with no paws in the way—watch anime in real-time, no waiting for downloads!
Description: |-
  A pure JS BitTorrent streaming environment, with a built-in list manager.
  Imagine qBit + Taiga + MPV, all in a single package, but streamed real-time.
  Completely ad free with no tracking/data collection.
  This app is meant to feel, look, work and perform like a streaming website/app, while providing all the advantages of torrenting, like file downloads, higher download speeds, better video quality and quicker releases.
  Unlike qBit's sequential approach, seeking into data that hasn't been downloaded yet will prioritise downloading that data, instead of simply closing MPV.
  Designed to be a similar experience to using a streaming website with functionality akin to MALSync and AniSkip.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  - feat: update modal
    - Updates will no longer be "forced", the user will instead be prompted once an update is available. This can be dismissed and will not reappear until the app is restarted.
  - feat: Android updater
    - Adds support for easily updating via the Android app, exactly the same as desktop.
    - Streamlines the update process across all platforms.
  - fix: ghost torrents
    - Swapping the current torrent with a seeding/staging torrent would cause the current torrent to vanish, but still be in the background.
  - fix: extra seeding torrent
    - Seeding torrents were incorrectly calculated, resulting in an extra torrent seeding.
  - fix: unload not respecting persist files
    - Unloading via the miniplayer was causing the torrent to be bumped to staging/seeding even if persist files were disabled and the seeding limit had been reached.
  - fix: search dropdown z-index
  - fix: banner image reactivity
