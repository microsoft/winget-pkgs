ShortDescription: BitTorrent streaming software with no paws in the way—watch anime in real-time, no waiting for downloads!
Description: |-
  A pure JS BitTorrent streaming environment, with a built-in list manager.
  Imagine qBit + Taiga + MPV, all in a single package, but streamed real-time.
  Completely ad free with no tracking/data collection.
  This app is meant to feel, look, work and perform like a streaming website/app, while providing all the advantages of torrenting, like file downloads, higher download speeds, better video quality and quicker releases.
  Unlike qBit's sequential approach, seeking into data that hasn't been downloaded yet will prioritise downloading that data, instead of simply closing MPV.
  Designed to be a similar experience to using a streaming website with functionality akin to MALSync and AniSkip.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  - feat: torrent provider filtering
    - You can now add preferred torrent providers; these are considered equally for your best result.
    - The torrent order and preferred audio language will be prioritized over the preferred provider.
  - feat: expandable lists on Android
    - Adds a toggle to enable or disable expandable lists. Lists default to scrolling.
  - feat: preset themes
    - Adds the Default (AMOLED) theme.
    - Buttons, inputs, and toggles are now all properly reactive.
    - Fixes color issues with the Default (Dark) theme and many transparency issues.
    - Improves accessibility with tooltips on icon-only buttons.
  - feat: Spanish (Latin American) subtitle language
  - fix: missing subtitles
    - Primarily fixes missing subtitles from release groups like Yameii.
  - fix: external player auto-play
    - Fixes external player auto-play not functioning when loading a file or switching episodes.
    - Fixes external player reopening when clicking to play the episode before auto-play is triggered.
  - fix: file manager sorting and reactivity
    - Files in the file manager will now be properly grouped by series, sorted by season, and episode number.
    - Files that had their series change will immediately be reflected in the File Manager without having to re-open it.
  - fix: episode list scaling and summary
    - Fixes issues on Android where lines were partially cropped due to exceeding the summary size.
    - Summary is now properly limited to the max lines denoted by ellipsis.
  - fix: Android hover buttons
    - Buttons that change state when hovering on desktop should not be highlighted after clicking them on Android. Now they are properly deselected after performing the button action.
  - fix: airing series triggering section update
    - Series that are airing have a countdown to the episode, which would cause the section to update when they didn't need to after a new query was completed.
    - All unnecessary keys have been removed from media data to prevent section updates.
  - fix: indefinite dub delays
    - Dubbed series that have production suspended but have the sub finished will now properly show Dub production as suspended.
  - fix: stale schedule data
    - Fixes a very rare edge case that would result in the episode feeds or schedule not updating, resulting in stale data as the manifest is saved.
  - fix: incorrect regex
    - Resulted in torrent cards showing incorrect tags.
  - fix: janky overlay check
    - Each time a file is loaded to the player any active overlays were closed.
  - fix: dual audio torrent results
    - The exact audio type will now be the highlighted best result instead of Dual Audio. Dual Audio will only be used as a fallback if the exact audio type isn't found.
    - English Dub terms will now be properly filtered out if there is no English Dub for the series.
    - Adds Chinese Audio term and preferred audio type.
    - Fixes incorrectly detecting Chinese Dub as an English Dub.
  - fix: incorrectly detecting dual track as dual audio
    - Dual Track typically doesn't refer to multiple audio tracks and causes accuracy issues if we assume it does.
  - fix: filter media title before term mapping
    - Some media titles resulted in incorrect term mapping.
    - Example: Synduality Noir was detected as Dual Audio because it has Dual in the title name. Filtering the titles out before mapping the terms results in higher accuracy.
  - fix: implement OAV filtering
    - Fixes resolving series that include OAV in their title.
  - fix: detecting episode number in title
  - fix: modal overflow
  - fix: only child preview card
  - fix: duplicate genres in query
  - fix: description regex
  - chore: improve zero episode management
    - Fixes edge cases with zero episodes affecting the file manager.
    - Zero episodes will now be displayed, and allow the episode number to be changed.
    - A series with more than 1 episode but the file is missing its episode number will automatically show the episode number as zero so it can be changed.
    - Changing a series that has a zero episode will change the target file if it's a zero episode without modifying the others.
  - chore: offline improvements
    - Allows for offline searches for already seen media.
    - Hides missing media from recommendations and relations.
    - Fixes errors being thrown, will now show the nothing found message.
    - Improves the accuracy of offline detection, which prevents constantly spamming Cloudflare.
    - Adds 404 images for missing banners, covers, episodes, and other icons.
  - chore: improve miniplayer
    - Adds a border to the miniplayer to improve visibility.
    - Fixed miniplayer scaling, the miniplayer now scales as a ratio to the size of the app window to prevent crowding.
    - Fixes a lot of miscellaneous miniplayer bugs on Android.
  - chore: improve outage detection
    - Fixes a majority of issues when the Anilist API is down. Functionality will now be similar to offline mode.
    - You will be able to search, view, play, load torrents, resolve media, and view the schedule for any series you have previously "seen".
    - Anything you haven't seen will be hidden and fail to resolve.
  - chore: rework following
    - The following section has been removed, as it was taking up too much space for providing nearly zero info.
    - User icons will be shown that when hovered or focused will show the user's profile and their current series stats.
  - chore: add safe area to cards
    - Added a safe area to notification and file manager cards behind the buttons/inputs on the card itself to prevent unintentional clicks to the card itself on Android.
  - chore: hide fast forward and rewind
    - Now properly hides these buttons when using an external player.
  - chore: add torrent button to episode list
    - Each episode card in the episode list under the anime details will now show a quick preview icon of the torrent status. This helps quickly identify pre-downloaded episodes.
  - chore: fuzzy subtitle match
    - Subtitles will be checked from the track name if not found in the track language.
  - chore: improve share and open buttons
    - Adds individual MyAnimeList and Anilist buttons to click to share or alt-click to open the webpage.
  - chore: fix incorrect batch search
    - Batch searches were returning cached results that didn't respect the Adult Content setting.
  - chore: hide focus elements
  - chore: better audio label order
