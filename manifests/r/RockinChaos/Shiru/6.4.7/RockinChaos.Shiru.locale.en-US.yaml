ShortDescription: Manage your personal media library, organize your collection, and stream your content in real time, no waiting required!
Description: |-
  A pure JS BitTorrent streaming environment, with a built-in list manager.
  Imagine qBit + Taiga + MPV, all in a single package, but streamed real-time.
  Completely ad free with no tracking/data collection.
  Unlike qBit's sequential approach, seeking into data that hasn't been downloaded yet will prioritise downloading that data, instead of simply closing MPV.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  - feat: add window restore button to tray menu
    - Adds a "Restore" option to the tray context menu that resets the window to its default size and centers it on the primary display.
    - This helps users recover from off-screen or incorrectly sized windows caused by display configuration changes or multi-monitor setups.
  - fix: auto-recover tray icon when destroyed
    - Prevents crashes when the tray icon is accidentally destroyed by users.
    - The app now automatically detects when the tray is missing or destroyed and recreates it.
  - fix: centralize and dedupe media requests
    - Fixes a rare edge case that would result in the requested media being missing from the cache.
    - If the requested media is missing from the cache, an attempt will now be made to fetch it in most cases.
  - fix: separate notch from system bar detection
    - Patches capacitor-plugin-safe-area to expose display cutout insets separately from system UI insets. This allows the app to accurately detect camera notches and position navigation elements correctly in landscape orientation.
  - fix: miniplayer position on settings page with active overlay
  - fix: batches incorrectly displayed as episode 0
  - fix: settings padding on Android
  - fix: episode number validation
  - chore: update deps
