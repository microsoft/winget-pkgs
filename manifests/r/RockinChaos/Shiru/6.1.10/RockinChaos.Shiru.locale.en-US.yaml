ShortDescription: BitTorrent streaming software with no paws in the way—watch anime in real-time, no waiting for downloads!
Description: |-
  A pure JS BitTorrent streaming environment, with a built-in list manager.
  Imagine qBit + Taiga + MPV, all in a single package, but streamed real-time.
  Completely ad free with no tracking/data collection.
  This app is meant to feel, look, work and perform like a streaming website/app, while providing all the advantages of torrenting, like file downloads, higher download speeds, better video quality and quicker releases.
  Unlike qBit's sequential approach, seeking into data that hasn't been downloaded yet will prioritise downloading that data, instead of simply closing MPV.
  Designed to be a similar experience to using a streaming website with functionality akin to MALSync and AniSkip.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  - fix: stalled torrents
    - Torrents were failing to progress when both urlList and url-list were present in the cache.
  - fix: episode card movie prompt
    - Was incorrectly showing the media instead of prompting to pick a torrent.
  - fix: Android episode summary
    - The progress bar on an episode would cut off the second line of the episode summary.
  - fix: external player progress
    - The duration of the video was being compared in minutes instead of seconds, resulting in a video being marked complete only after a few seconds of watch time.
    - Adds a fallback duration for media lacking duration (typically initial releases).
  - fix: Android torrent download location permissions
    - Now requests "All Files" access when setting a custom download location to resolve no permission errors when setting the location at the root level of the internal file system.
  - fix: Android EACCES on torrent path reset
    - Fixes a bug that occurs when resetting the torrent download location back to the default /tmp.
  - fix: miniplayer padding
  - fix: misc devtools issues
  - chore: improve notifications performance
    - Greatly improves the performance when sending MANY notifications, typically when starting up the app after not being used for several days.
    - Reduces the number of system notifications sent to the 20 most recent (in each batch), which silences noisy notifications. The in-app "local" notifications are not affected by this.
    - New notifications are processed in batches, improving performance.
    - Better deduplication when handling batch notifications, preventing the system from being spammed with RSS and Schedule notifications when RSS takes priority.
  - chore: bump to webtorrent v2.8.4
