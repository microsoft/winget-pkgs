ShortDescription: BitTorrent streaming software with no paws in the way—watch anime in real-time, no waiting for downloads!
Description: |-
  A pure JS BitTorrent streaming environment, with a built-in list manager.
  Imagine qBit + Taiga + MPV, all in a single package, but streamed real-time.
  Completely ad free with no tracking/data collection.
  This app is meant to feel, look, work and perform like a streaming website/app, while providing all the advantages of torrenting, like file downloads, higher download speeds, better video quality and quicker releases.
  Unlike qBit's sequential approach, seeking into data that hasn't been downloaded yet will prioritise downloading that data, instead of simply closing MPV.
  Designed to be a similar experience to using a streaming website with functionality akin to MALSync and AniSkip.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  - fix: prevent the app from being killed during playback on Android
    - Fixes the app being randomly killed during external player video playback. This was occurring due to new Android policies limiting the CPU usage on background apps.
    - Removes the battery optimization permission requirement for external playback.
  - fix: wide cover images
    - Fixes weird cover images that aren't a standard size, like Dr. STONE SCIENCE FUTURE Cour 2.
  - fix: Ooops! Dubbed Releases
    - Would occasionally occur when the cache is reset or when it is unable to find the respective media in the cache.
  - fix: dub filter
    - The Dub filter would break the user list search and was non-functional for general search.
  - fix: Android episode summary
    - Fixes description being cut off and skeleton card showing extra lines that aren't shown.
  - fix: discord-rpc
    - Fixes edge cases where rpc is shown when it shouldn't be.
    - rpc now properly shows after Discord restarts or when swapping profiles.
    - Fixes edge case where limited isn't respected until several seconds after startup.
  - fix: mapping rate limit
    - Adds rate limiting to mappings so data is resolved and returned rather than outright failing. May slightly increase how long you see skeleton cards when hammering the api.
  - fix: duplicate torrent edge case
  - fix: hide availability warning when seeding
  - fix: showing broken image
  - chore: improve player to external player
    - Heavily improves the external player functionality in relation to the built-in player. Functionality of the external player is triggered similarly to how the built-in player functions.
    - External player now only appears when you click to play the video (or if auto-play is enabled in settings) instead of forcing the external player to open as soon as the video loads.
    - Buttons that do not relate to the external player will now be hidden from the built-in player.
  - chore: improve schedule fetching
    - Dub/Sub/Hentai Home sections and Sub/Dub schedules will now only be fetched when a change is detected. This improves how quickly you see changes to the schedule and episodes added to the feed.
    - This heavily reduces data usage since checking for changes costs less than 1KB, whereas fetching the feeds constantly costs more than 1MB each interval.
  - chore: improve home sections
    - Modifying the sections in the settings will automatically update the home page without requiring an app restart.
    - If a section update is requested and the values are identical, the update will now be skipped.
  - chore: improve caching performance
    - Caching has been heavily improved, now much more performant and properly batches writes for queries and media.
  - chore: reduce torrent cache hits
    - Improves upon cache comparisons to reduce the number of times data is saved to the cache.
  - chore: improve bitfield caching
  - chore: reduce log size
