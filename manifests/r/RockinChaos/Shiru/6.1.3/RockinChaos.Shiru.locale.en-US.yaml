ShortDescription: BitTorrent streaming software with no paws in the way—watch anime in real-time, no waiting for downloads!
Description: |-
  A pure JS BitTorrent streaming environment, with a built-in list manager.
  Imagine qBit + Taiga + MPV, all in a single package, but streamed real-time.
  Completely ad free with no tracking/data collection.
  This app is meant to feel, look, work and perform like a streaming website/app, while providing all the advantages of torrenting, like file downloads, higher download speeds, better video quality and quicker releases.
  Unlike qBit's sequential approach, seeking into data that hasn't been downloaded yet will prioritise downloading that data, instead of simply closing MPV.
  Designed to be a similar experience to using a streaming website with functionality akin to MALSync and AniSkip.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  - feat: offline detection
    - WIP implementation of offline handling, giving a visual indicator.
    - Allows things to load quicker, knowing the data can't be fetched.
  - feat: torrent sorting
    - There are now six sorting options for torrent results; the auto-selected torrent will consider both this sorting option and your preferred audio language.
    - The six sorting options are;
      - seeders (default), sorts by most to least seeders.
      - smallest, sorts by smallest file size to largest file size.
      - best, sorts by most accurate results.
      - batch, sorts by batches first.
      - newest, sorts by newest uploads first.
      - oldest, sorts by oldest uploads first.
  - feat: dynamic extension loading
    - Heavily reworked extensions, they now load dynamically so search results will appear as each extension completes its query significantly decreasing wait times.
    - Extension queries are now cached for a little over 1 minute, closing the torrent search then re-opening it wont result in another long wait for results.
    - Torrent Search has been reworked to be clean and minimal with descriptive details. The auto-selected torrent is clearly visible, and the autoplay indicator is vibrant. If the previously selected torrent is the same as the auto-selected torrent, they will be merged for clarity.
    - Trusted sources are now visible under the extensions section in the settings when clicking to add a source.
  - feat: watch trailer button
    - You can now watch a full-screen interactive trailer (if available) by clicking the trailer button when viewing the anime details.
    - The button will automatically be hidden on series that do not have a readily available trailer.
  - feat: home section desktop drag scroll
    - All home sections are now drag scrollable on desktop.
    - Scrolling via buttons is no longer "spammable" allowing for proper smooth scrolling.
  - fix: player immersion
    - Resolves immersion issues with Android.
    - Immersion is now completely disabled when the video is paused; there was never really a good reason to be immersed in a black screen.
  - fix: shorts being detected as a movie
    - Shorts like the latest Lycoris Recoil were incorrectly detected as a movie due to the synonyms containing the movie phrase, which incorrectly disabled the episode number input box.
  - fix: showing incorrect episode data
    - Data typically for "second seasons" was being duplicated from the first season for episodes that haven't been released.
    - Instead of showing incorrect data for unreleased episodes, no data will be shown at all.
    - This change also simplifies episodes, only showing the next episode that will be released instead of all unreleased episodes.
  - fix: re-authentication
    - Attempting to re-authenticate the currently logged-in user would result in the app being bricked.
  - fix: airing schedule
    - Schedule would randomly have entries that were not airing due to too large of an exclusion query.
  - fix: wayland crashing
    - This fix primarily targets Linux Arch Wayland with systems running Intel Iris graphics.
  - fix: macOS tray and traffic lights
  - fix: duplicate Space tags
  - chore: desktop in-app authentication
    - Windows, Linux, and macOS login authentication will be done in-app rather than using an external browser that relies on custom protocols.
    - This now standardizes functionality across all platforms, including Linux.
  - chore: heavily reduce animations
    - Removed smooth scrolling, it was a nice gimmick but had way too many breaking edge cases and would fail to function during micro stuttering and across multiple platforms, e.g., MacOS and Android.
    - Removed page switching animations to improve page load times.
    - Expandable sidebar is now disabled by default and will potentially be phased out in later releases.
  - chore: speed up caching
    - Significant performance improvements for caching.
  - chore: implement file error toasts
    - Gives better feedback to end users when a torrent release doesn't contain a valid file, typically occurs when a torrent is a zip file.
    - Also allows for other miscellaneous errors that give feedback on why something isn't playing without viewing the console.
  - chore: many Android QoL changes.
    - Further improves the UI and navigation on Android devices.
    - Fixes a large majority of scaling issues when switching from portrait to landscape.
    - Fixes preview cards being off-screen.
    - Added the ability to disable preview cards (for small cards).
    - Major fixes for the search and schedule page (it was basically impossible to use due to clutter). An "Advanced Search" button has been added for small screens.
    - Preview cards will now show on focusing small cards for half a second (good for TV).
  - chore: reworked miniplayer
    - Makes the miniplayer a bit more intuitive with scaling, position, and easier-to-click buttons.
  - chore: implement proper desktop card offset
    - Toggle lists (recommendations and relations) now properly offset the preview card so it's not off-screen or hovering over the episode list.
  - chore: heavily rework window controls
    - Completely removes the craptastic implementation of custom window control buttons. This was causing way too many issues, from scalability to a lack of features like Windows snapping.
    - The visual appeal of the blurred background for the controls will remain, and icon readability has been improved.
  - chore: combined genres and tags search
    - The genres search box is now for both genres and tags, with identifying sections.
    - These are now fully scrollable, so you can see all available options.
    - Alt-clicking will now exclude that genre and/or tag from the search (or type the keyword starting with "!" e.g. "!Action").
  - chore: reworked search history
    - The airing schedule page and search page are now two separate filtered queries.
    - Filters on airing schedule and search page are now cached and saved, restarting the app will restore your previous search queries.
  - chore: improve toasts
    - Makes the button easier to click and shrinks the size of the toasts.
  - chore: improve section loading
    - Reduces the number of cards to be rendered, improving home page performance.
  - chore: shore more items
    - Toggle Lists (Relations and Recommendations) will now show the maximum number of possible items that can fit on a single row for the current screen size.
  - chore: dynamically update timers
    - Episode cards and the airing schedule will now have the timers updated every minute to reflect an accurate time rather than remaining static.
  - chore: reworked settings page scaling
    - Scales a lot better with smaller screens, now making it more user-intuitive.
  - chore: macOS only low-res tray icon
  - chore: improve search badges
  - chore: remove svelte-radix
  - chore: improve resize observing
  - chore: fix scoring placeholder
  - chore: update to webtorrent v2.6.7
