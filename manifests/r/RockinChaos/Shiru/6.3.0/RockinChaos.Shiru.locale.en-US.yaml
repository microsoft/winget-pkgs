ShortDescription: Manage your personal media library, organize your collection, and stream your content in real time, no waiting required!
Description: |-
  A pure JS BitTorrent streaming environment, with a built-in list manager.
  Imagine qBit + Taiga + MPV, all in a single package, but streamed real-time.
  Completely ad free with no tracking/data collection.
  Unlike qBit's sequential approach, seeking into data that hasn't been downloaded yet will prioritise downloading that data, instead of simply closing MPV.

- anime
- streaming

ReleaseNotes: |-
  - feat: adding local files for playback
    - In the torrent manager, you can now use the upload button to add local media files as a private torrent for local playback. These are copied to the cache under the shiru-local folder.
    - Selecting more than one file will create a batch.
    - The file picker also supports .torrent files to stage them for download.
    - Added a copy magnet link button in the torrent details.
  - feat: overhaul history navigation with sidebar support
    - Complete rewrite of the navigation/history system to unify back/forward behavior.
    - Adds full desktop support through clickable sidebar buttons.
    - Parent page/view restoration now ensures consistent UX without unexpected closures.
    - Fixes bad navigation behavior on Android with anime details view changes.
  - feat: macOS x64 codecs
    - The universal build now supports codecs on x64 and arm64.
  - feat: show my anime
    - Alt-clicking (right click or tap and hold) the hide my anime button in the search will now show only your anime.
    - Useful for only showing your anime on the airing schedule page.
  - feat: new app icon
    - Another big thanks to Ashtaka on Discord for designing the icon and logo.
  - fix: handle missing subtitle style blocks
    - The subtitle parser occasionally received headers without any style blocks, causing the track to not appear at all.
  - fix: aggressive title matching
    - Fixes certain series not being labeled Dual Audio.
  - fix: show multi-header release in episode list
    - Multi-Header releases like "May I Ask for One Final Thing?" will now show properly in the Episode List.
    - Dubs are also now considered for this, overriding any sub dates, as a dubbed episode wouldn't release before the sub.
  - fix: broken preview trailers
    - Trailers that are auto-played in preview cards will no longer show errors; if they fail, it will fall back to the banner image.
    - Fixes an edge case with trailers not functioning unless the cache is cleared.
    - Trailers now load faster.
    - Muting and unmuting the trailer from the preview card no longer restarts the trailer.
    - Preview Card banner and trailer are now 16:9 ratio.
  - fix: zero episode air date
    - Fixes "Dusk Beyond the End of the World" showing 1 episode ahead as already released due to the presence of the zero episode.
    - Fixes detecting the description of zero episodes.
  - fix: zero episode behavior
    - Torrent details now properly show zero episodes.
    - The previous episode button is now visible in the player when playing episode 1.
    - Clicking the watch button now plays the correct episode.
  - fix: showing duplicate or array resolution
    - Torrent cards were showing duplicate resolutions or multiple, but didn't get their own badge.
  - fix: Android drag scroll
    - Prevents interactable touch elements from triggering drag scroll.
  - fix: infinite scroll
    - Search page scrolling is now more consistent.
    - If you scroll to the bottom before the current batch query loads, it will automatically load the next batch after the current batch resolves.
  - fix: auto file select on rss feeds
    - Fixed RSS feeds incorrectly prompting for torrent selection when Auto-File Select was disabled.
  - fix: subtitles missing cjk glyphs
    - Noto Sans will now be used as the default font for subtitles whenever there are missing glyphs in the provided subtitle attachments.
  - fix: exclude trailers
    - Fixes trailers incorrectly being in the playable files list.
  - fix: focus preview cards
    - Improves the expected reactivity of preview cards, whether they should be shown or not, based on certain events..
  - fix: don't always verify OVA match
    - Verification when resolving OVA media will now fail if the file name is missing OVA or if the file name has OVA and the media is not an OVA.
  - fix: missing NCED and NCOP
    - Can't filter these out unless it's actually specified as an anime_type.
  - fix: start at the lowest unwatched id
    - Lowest unwatched was previously determined based on the format of the series, which would result in weird issues like OVA being before the main series.
    - We now get the lowest media id as ids are typically sequential.
  - fix: preserve episode and season when failing to resolve
    - Ensure files that initially failed to resolve keep their known episode and season values instead of relying on torrent name parsing, preventing misdetections like "1080p" as an episode number.
  - fix: failing to detect playable episodes
    - Series that are releasing but do not have an air date for the next episode would end up failing to detect how many episodes have already aired.
  - fix: check media status
    - Check if the media is marked as finished before stating X episode hasn't released.
  - fix: show episodes for movies
    - If a movie has multiple episodes, they will now be detailed rather than listing each as "Movie".
  - fix: replace timestamp-like chapter names
    - Better to use a placeholder than a confusing timestamp.
  - fix: resolving My Gift Lvl 9999 Unlimited Gacha
    - Resolves issues with release groups using the Mugen Gacha synonym.
  - fix: resolving Mr. Ginpachi's Zany Class
    - Was primarily an issue with subbed release groups using an incorrect Romaji title.
  - fix: resolving Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam
    - Some release groups used Z instead of Zeta for shorthand.

  - chore: hide toasts when fullscreen
    - Hides toasts while in fullscreen to avoid breaking immersion.

    - Fixes a lot of Linux issues, including the native title bar.
    - Improves overall app stability.
    - Removed release group exclusions from desktop.
  - chore: deprecate flags
    - Unfortunately, Chromium has disabled Windows-like smooth scrolling, so we can no longer rely on these for scroll behavior.
  - chore: implement batch guesses
    - If the detected hash for a series doesn't have an associated episode (unplayed batch), assume it is very likely accurate as the desired series.
  - chore: show buffering when unplayable
    - Instead of viewing a black screen wondering why nothing is happening, it will now be evident by the buffering until playback is fully ready.
  - chore: improve torrent card terms
    - Adds some missing terms and improves the cleaning of the displayed file name.
  - chore: rework progress sorting
    - Sorting by 'Your Progress' will now sort by distance to completion rather than by how many episodes you watched.
