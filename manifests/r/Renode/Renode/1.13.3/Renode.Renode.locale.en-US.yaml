ShortDescription: Renode is an open source software development framework with commercial support from Antmicro that lets you develop, debug and test multi-node device systems reliably, scalably and effectively.
Description: Renode is a development framework which accelerates IoT and embedded systems development by letting you simulate physical hardware systems - including both the CPU, peripherals, sensors, environment and wired or wireless medium between nodes.  It lets you run, debug and test unmodified embedded software on your PC - from bare System-on-Chips, through complete devices to multi-node systems.
