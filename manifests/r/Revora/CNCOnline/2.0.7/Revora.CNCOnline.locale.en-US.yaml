ShortDescription: C&C:Online is a GameSpy emulating server for modern Command & Conquer games.
Description: C&C:Online is a GameSpy emulating server for modern Command & Conquer games. It's based on our T3A:Online project for BFME, adapted to work for all the Command & Conquer games affected by the GameSpy closure (Generals, Zero Hour, C&C 3, Kane's Wrath, Red Alert 3). After registering on Revora and installing our launcher, you'll be able to continue playing the same way you could before the GameSpy shutdown.
