ReleaseNotes: |-
  Distributed as rtools44-6335-6327.exe and rtools44-aarch64-6335-6327.exe.
  GCC has been patched so that one can again use GCC from a mapped network drive. This did not work in 6104 due to a GCC change that woke up a bug in binutils. To avoid problems, it is still advisable to install all of Rtools to a local disk and use it from there.
  GCC has been patched to avoid a bug in the C++ library causing incorrect results of complex exponentiation.
  HDF5 is now built with Fortran support.
