ReleaseNotes: |-
  Distributed as rtools43-5948-5818.exe.

  gRPC and dependencies re2, abseil and c-ares have been added. Protobuf has been updated to 25.2. Rtools now include also the native protocol buffer compiler (protoc).

  A batch-file wrapper has been created for pkg-config to simplify use in some github action runners. See the documentation for more details (for R 4.3, for R-devel).

  The pkg-config configuration has been fixed to allow detection of expanded absolute paths, which improves output for some libraries (MXE packages).

  Packages linking httpuv now also need to link dbghelp, uuid and ole32. This affects one CRAN package, httpuv.

  Packages linking protobuf now also need to link the abseil libraries. The number of abseil libraries is large, but one may avoid the need for specifying them individually by using pkg-config.

  Code using xml2 may have to be updated to follow changes in the API. This required changes in one CRAN package, XML.

  Upstream MXE changes have been merged from fca881fdf19405f80252967c97590976f2c2b570, with numerous additional updates to selected MXE packages as detailed below.

  GCC has been patched to avoid a size limit for pre-compiled headers (PCH), back-porting a change from a later version. This change does not make static libraries incompatible.

  An experimental build of this version of Rtools43 for aarch64 is available from here and unstable experimental snapshots from here. See this blog post for initial information on the R on Windows/aarch64 (ARM64) efforts. No assumptions should be made on that the aarch64 Rtools (or R support) will stay in the current form. The links for the builds should be considered as temporary and currently the content replaces that from previous version of Rtools. The aarch64 support is only part of R-devel (not R 4.3).
