ShortDescription: Rtools is a toolchain bundle used for building R packages from source (those that need compilation of C/C++ or Fortran code) and for building R itself.
Description: |
  Rtools is a toolchain bundle used for building R packages from source (those that need compilation of C/C++ or Fortran code) and for build R itself. Rtools43 is used for R-devel, the development version of R since revision 83535 and is intended for R 4.3.0.
  Rtools43 consists of Msys2 build tools, GCC 12/MinGW-w64 compiler toolchain, libraries built using the toolchain, and QPDF. Rtools43 supports 64-bit Windows and UCRT as the C runtime.
  Compared to Rtools42, Rtools43 has newer versions of three core components: GCC, MinGW-w64, and binutils. It is therefore recommended to re-compile all code with the new toolchain to avoid problems. The code compiled by even earlier versions of Rtools is incompatible due to use of MSVCRT and has to be recompiled with Rtools43 for use in R packages.
