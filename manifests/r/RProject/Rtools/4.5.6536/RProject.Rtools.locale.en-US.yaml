ReleaseNotes: |-
  Distributed as rtools45-6536-6492.exe and rtools45-aarch64-6536-6492.exe.
  Compared to Rtools44 (release 6459), the core components have been updated: GCC to version 14.2.0 and binutils to version 2.43.1. In the aarch64 version of Rtools, LLVM has been updated to version 19.1.7. MinGW-w64 version 11.0.1 is still used because of numerical differences seen with version 12.0.0 (MinGW-w64 12.0.0 uses more of the math functions from UCRT than version 11.0.1).
  The build of curl now supports HTTP/2 via a new dependency, nghttp2. Therefore, packages linking to curl and not using pkg-config need to update their make files to explicitly link nghttp2. Packages using pkg-config for establishing the linking commands will now link nghttp2 automatically. Patches were provided to maintainers of the affected CRAN and Bioconductor packages.
  See Porting to GCC 14 for a detailed description of common issues encountered when fixing newly reported compiler errors and warnings. Note that R 4.5 by default selects the C23 standard, which is newer than the default in GCC 14.
  The version of Rtools for 64-bit ARM (aarch64) machines is still experimental. It lacks msmpi (not supported on aarch64) and yasm (does not support aarch64). The LLVM 19 flang (flang-new) Fortran compiler is experimental and cannot compile some of the CRAN packages. A number of CRAN and Bioconductor packages will have to be updated to support LLVM (or aarch64).
  The Rtools cross-compilers run on Linux (tested/used on 64-bit Intel): one version targets 64-bit Intel Windows and one targets 64-bit ARM Windows.
