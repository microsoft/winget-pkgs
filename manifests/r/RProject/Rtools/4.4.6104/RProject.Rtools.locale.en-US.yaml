ReleaseNotes: |-
  Distributed as rtools44-6104-6039.exe and rtools44-aarch64-6104-6039.exe.
  Compared to Rtools43 (release 5958), the core components have been updated: GCC to version 13.2.0, MinGW-W64 to version 11.0.1 and binutils to version 2.42.
  A number of R packages have to be updated to reflect changes in linking: common new dependencies include libdeflate, lerc, libpsl, brotli. Maintainers of affected CRAN and Bioconductor packages have been notified and provided with patches. Package authors may use pkg-config for establishing the linking commands, which should reduce the frequency of needed updates in packages.
  Some CRAN packages require to explicitly include <cstdint> with GCC 13. Package authors have been provided with patches. See Porting to GCC 13 for more information.
  Upstream MXE changes have been merged from a147a77503fc1933ba4196ad21025a99a0ba90b3., with additional updates as detailed below.
  This release of Rtools also includes a version for 64-bit ARM (aarch64) machines, based on LLVM (and libc++). Compared to the version for 64-bit Intel, it includes llvm 17.0.6 (and lacks gcc, binutils). Currently it also lacks msmpi (not supported on aarch64), yasm (does not support aarch64), gtk2 and libv8. The LLVM flang (flang-new) Fortran compiler is still experimental and cannot compile some of the CRAN packages. A number of CRAN and Bioconductor packages will have to be updated to support LLVM (or aarch64), some package maintainers were provided with patches.
  The Rtools cross-compilers run on Linux (tested/used on 64-bit Intel): one version targets 64-bit Intel Windows and one targets 64-bit ARM Windows.
