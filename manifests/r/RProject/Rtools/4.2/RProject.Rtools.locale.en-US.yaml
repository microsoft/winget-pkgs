ShortDescription: Rtools is a toolchain bundle used for building R packages from source (those that need compilation of C/C++ or Fortran code) and for building R itself.
Description: |
  Rtools is a toolchain bundle used for building R packages from source (those that need compilation of C/C++ or Fortran code) and for building R itself.  Rtools42 is used for R 4.2.x and currently for R-devel, the development version of R since revision 81360.  Rtools42 consists of Msys2 build tools, GCC 10/MinGW-w64 compiler toolchain and libraries and QPDF.  Rtools42 supports 64-bit Windows and UCRT as the C runtime.  The code compiled by earlier versions of Rtools is incompatible and has to be recompiled with Rtools42 for use in R packages.  Switching to UCRT allows to use UTF-8 as the native encoding on Windows.
