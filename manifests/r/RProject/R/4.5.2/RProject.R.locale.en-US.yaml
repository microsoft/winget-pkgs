ShortDescription: R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics.
Description: |-
  R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is a GNU project which is similar to the S language and environment which was developed at Bell Laboratories (formerly AT&T, now Lucent Technologies) by John Chambers and colleagues. R can be considered as a different implementation of S. There are some important differences, but much code written for S runs unaltered under R.
  R provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear modelling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, …) and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible. The S language is often the vehicle of choice for research in statistical methodology, and R provides an Open Source route to participation in that activity.
  One of R’s strengths is the ease with which well-designed publication-quality plots can be produced, including mathematical symbols and formulae where needed. Great care has been taken over the defaults for the minor design choices in graphics, but the user retains full control.
  R is available as Free Software under the terms of the Free Software Foundation’s GNU General Public License in source code form. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms and similar systems (including FreeBSD and Linux), Windows and MacOS.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  UTILITIES
  - R CMD check now handles archives with extension ‘.tar’ or ‘.tar.zstd’ (where zstd compression is supported by the R build).
  BUG FIXES
  - t.test(c(1:3, Inf)) and similar no longer produce an error but return a (still not so useful) "htest" result, fixing PR#18901, thanks to Jesse Alderliesten.
  - attr(., "tsp") <- val now uses getOption("ts.eps") instead of hardwired 1e-5; consequently, ts(.., ts.eps=*) now passes ts.eps to the "tsp" setting C code; both fixing a long-standing ‘FIXME’.
  - insertSource() now ignores the internal .packageName object, avoiding a superfluous message.
  - In static HTML help, links to vignette files from the default ‘doc/index.html’ page now also work for packages not installed in the default .Library, thanks to a report by Patrice Kiener.
  - fixInNamespace("S3method") failed to update the S3 methods table when the generic was not on the search path.
  - In plain-text help (Rd2txt), an initial newline from an Rd inline \eqn no longer breaks the paragraph.
  - hist(*, log = "x") now works without a warning, thanks to Martin Smith's PR#18921.
  - Subassigning "POSIXlt", i.e., <tdat>[i] <- val and <tdat>[[i]] <- val now rebalance as they should, thanks to Mikael Jagan's PR#18919.
  - <POSIXlt>[*] (re-)setting "balanced", fixing PR#18681 comment #7, thanks to Mikael Jagan.
  - All four of {col,row}{Sums,Means}(Z, na.rm=TRUE) now correctly work with complex Z where is.na(Re(Z)) differs from is.na(Im(Z)), fixing PR#18942, unearthed by Dirk Eddelbuettel.
  - Fix for glyph rendering on the quartz() device when there is other (“normal”) text drawn on the device. The problem was that the text transformation matrix was not reset so glyphs would be rendered incorrectly (often completely outside the device, i.e., not visible).
  - Functions install.packages() and download.packages() again consult option download.file.method when the download method is unspecified.
  - Tanguy Barthelemy and colleagues at the ‘R Dev Day’ following Rencontres R in May 2025 extended the help page of lm(), fixing PR#18058. As suggested by Thomas Soeiro, such notes were also added to the glm(), poly() and splines::bs() and ns() pages.
  - lbeta(1i, 1) now signals an error, as lbeta() is not implemented for complex, fixing PR#18946 from Ben Bolker and Kasper Kristensen.
  - The Cairo-based SVG device uses pt as the default document unit also with Cairo >= 1.17.8 (PR#18912).
  - pretty(*, eps.correct = 2) has been fixed, e.g., to avoid over 1 million length result for pretty(c(0, 1e-322), eps.correct = 2).
  - When "POSIXlt" date-time objects are NA-padded from subsetting or increasing length in the `[` or `length<-` methods, the "balanced" attribute is set to NA, now; noted in PR#18681, thanks to Mikael Jagan.
