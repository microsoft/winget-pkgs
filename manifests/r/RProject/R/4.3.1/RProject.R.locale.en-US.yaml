ShortDescription: R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics.
Description: |-
  R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is a GNU project which is similar to the S language and environment which was developed at Bell Laboratories (formerly AT&T, now Lucent Technologies) by John Chambers and colleagues. R can be considered as a different implementation of S. There are some important differences, but much code written for S runs unaltered under R.
  R provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear modelling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, …) and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible. The S language is often the vehicle of choice for research in statistical methodology, and R provides an Open Source route to participation in that activity.
  One of R’s strengths is the ease with which well-designed publication-quality plots can be produced, including mathematical symbols and formulae where needed. Great care has been taken over the defaults for the minor design choices in graphics, but the user retains full control.
  R is available as Free Software under the terms of the Free Software Foundation’s GNU General Public License in source code form. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms and similar systems (including FreeBSD and Linux), Windows and MacOS.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  C-LEVEL FACILITIES
  - The C-level API version of R's integrate(), Rdqags() in ‘Applic.h’, now returns the correct number of integrand evaluations neval, fixing PR#18515 reported and diagnosed by Stephen Wade.
  - The C prototypes for LAPACK calls dspgv and dtptrs in ‘R_exts/Lapack.h’ had one too many and one too few character length arguments — but this has not caused any known issues. To get the corrected prototypes, include
        #include <Rconfig.h> // for PR18534fixed
        #ifdef PR18534fixed
        # define usePR18534fix 1
        #endif
        #include <R_exts/Lapack.h>
    in your C/C++ code (PR#18534).

  INSTALLATION
  - Many of the checks of esoteric Internet operations and those using unreliable external sites have been moved to a new target that is not run by default and primarily intended for the core developers. To run them use
        cd tests; make test-Internet-dev

  BUG FIXES
  - .S3methods(), typically called from methods(), again marks methods from package base as visible.
    Also, the visibility of non-base methods is again determined by the method's presence in search().
  - tools::Rdiff() is now more robust against invalid strings, fixing installation tests on Windows without Rtools installed (PR#18530).
  - Fix (new) bug in hcl.colors(2, *), by Achim Zeileis (PR#18523).
  - head(., <illegal>) and tail(..) now produce more useful "Error in ...." error messages, fixing PR#18362.
  - Package code syntax on Windows is checked in UTF-8 when UTF-8 is the native encoding.
  - na.contiguous(x) now also returns the first run, when it is at the beginning and there is a later one of the same length; reported to R-devel, including a fix, by Georgi Boshnakov. Further, by default, it modifies only an existing attr(*,"tsp") but otherwise no longer sets one.
  - chol(<not pos.def>, pivot = <T|F>) now gives a correct error or warning message (depending on pivot), thanks to Mikael Jagan's (PR#18541).
