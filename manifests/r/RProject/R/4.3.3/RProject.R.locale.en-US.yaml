ShortDescription: R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics.
Description: |-
  R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is a GNU project which is similar to the S language and environment which was developed at Bell Laboratories (formerly AT&T, now Lucent Technologies) by John Chambers and colleagues. R can be considered as a different implementation of S. There are some important differences, but much code written for S runs unaltered under R.
  R provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear modelling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, …) and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible. The S language is often the vehicle of choice for research in statistical methodology, and R provides an Open Source route to participation in that activity.
  One of R’s strengths is the ease with which well-designed publication-quality plots can be produced, including mathematical symbols and formulae where needed. Great care has been taken over the defaults for the minor design choices in graphics, but the user retains full control.
  R is available as Free Software under the terms of the Free Software Foundation’s GNU General Public License in source code form. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms and similar systems (including FreeBSD and Linux), Windows and MacOS.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  NEW FEATURES
  - iconv() now fixes up variant encoding names such as "utf8" case-insensitively.
  DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT
  - The legacy encoding = "MacRoman" is deprecated in pdf() and postscript(): support was incomplete in earlier versions of R.
  BUG FIXES
  - Arguments are now properly forwarded to methods on S4 generics with ... in the middle of their formal arguments. This was broken for the case when a method introduced an argument but did not include ... in its own formals. Thanks to Hervé Pagès for the report PR#18538.
  - Some invalid file arguments to pictex(), postscript() and xfig() opened a file called ‘NA’ rather than throw an error. These included postscript(NULL) (which some people expected to work like pdf(NULL)).
  - Passing filename = NA to svg(), cairo_pdf(), cairo_ps() or the Cairo-based bitmap devices opened a file called ‘NA’: it now throws an error.
  - quartz(file = NA) opened a file called ‘NA’, including when used as a Quartz-based bitmap device. It now gives an error.
  - rank(<long vector>) now works, fixing PR#18617, thanks to Ilia Kats.
  - seq.int() did not adequately check its length.out argument.
  - match(<POSIXct>, .) is correct again for differing time zones, ditto for "POSIXlt", fixing PR#18618 reported by Bastian Klein.
  - drop.terms(*, dropx = <0-length>) now works, fixing PR#18563 as proposed by Mikael Jagan.
  - drop.terms(*) keeps + offset(.) terms when it should, PR#18565, and drop.terms() no longer makes up a response, PR#18566, fixing both bugs thanks to Mikael Jagan.
  - getS3method("t", "test") no longer finds the t.test() function, fixing PR#18627.
  - pdf() and postscript() support for the documented Adobe encodings "Greek" and "Cyrilllic" was missing (although the corresponding Windows' codepages could be used).
  - Computations of glyph metric information for pdf() and postscript() did not take into account that transliteration could replace one character by two or more (only seen on macOS 14) and typically warned that the information was not known.
  - rank(x) no longer overflows during integer addition, when computing rank average for largish but not-yet long vector x, fixing PR#18630, thanks to Ilia Kats.
  - list.files() on Windows now returns also files with names longer that 260 bytes (the Windows limit is 260 characters). Previously, some file names particularly with ‘East Asian’ characters were omitted.
  - cov2cor(<0 x 0>) now works, fixing PR#18423 thanks to Mikael Jagan and Elin Waring.
  - cov2cor(<negative diagonal>) and similar now give one warning instead of two, with better wording, fixing PR#18424 thanks to Mikael Jagan.
  - tools:: startDynamicHelp() now ensures port is in proper range, fixing PR#18645.
  - pbeta(x, a,b) is correct now for x=0 or 1 in the boundary cases where a or b or both are 0, fixing PR#18672 thanks to Michael Fay.
  - pmatch(x, table) for large table, also called for data frame row selection, dfrm[nm, ], is now interruptible, fixing PR#18656.
  - predict(<rank-deficient lm>, newdata=*) fix computing of nbasis, see Russ Lenth's comment 29 in PR#16158.
  - Added a work-around for a bug in macOS 14.3.1 and higher which prevents R plots in the Quartz Cocoa device from updating on screen.
