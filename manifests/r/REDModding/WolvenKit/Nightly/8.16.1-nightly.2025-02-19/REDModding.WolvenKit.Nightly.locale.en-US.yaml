ShortDescription: WolvenKit is an open-source modding tool for Cyberpunk 2077.
Description: WolvenKit is an open-source modding tool for Cyberpunk 2077. Our vision is to develop a standalone software which is capable of reading and writing all REDengine file formats. Additionally the WolvenKit application is designed to simplify and accelerate modding workflows. This repository was created to demonstrate how CDPR's proprietary REDengine reads and writes file formats.
