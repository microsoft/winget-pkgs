ShortDescription: Pull request monitoring app for Github
Description: |-
  Pullp is a tool to help you manage pull requests and reviews on your Github repositories, available for Mac, Linux and Windows.

  An interactive dashboard shows all the open pull requests for your chosen repositories and highlights where your review has been requested.
  This information syncs with Github every minute!
  To help you keep track of things, Pullp has configurable desktop notifications to keep you in the loop.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  - ‚ú® Draft PRs are now visually distinguished from "normal" PRs.
  - ‚ú® Extended the menu bar to include an option to open the Chrome devtools.
  - üèóÔ∏èUpgraded 10(!) major versions of Electron so now using the latest.
    This resolves an issue with Github's login process no longer supporting the version of Chrome that was bundled in the previous Pullp version.
    Significant rework was required to complete this upgrade so ü§û there are no bugs as a result!
  - üêõFixed a bug where a review request made to a team that you are a member of would not result in the PR being flagged as "your review requested" in the UI.
    This was due to an unexpected change made by Github in their API.
