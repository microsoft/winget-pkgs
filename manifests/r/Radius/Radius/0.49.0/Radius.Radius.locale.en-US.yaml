  Announcing Radius v0.49.0
  Today we're happy to announce the release of Radius v0.49.0. Check out the highlights below, along with the full changelog for more details.
  We would like to extend our thanks to all the contributors who helped make this release possible!
  Intro to Radius
  If you're new to Radius, check out our website, radapp.io, for more information. Also visit our getting started guide to learn how to install Radius and create your first app.
  Highlights
  Radius Resource Types (RRT) Enhancements
  Radius Resource types Connection
  Connection support between RRT->RRT is now available. For example, when connecting a Radius.Resources/webServices resource to a Radius.Resources/postgreSQL resource, the PostgreSQL properties are now included in the Recipe's context object. This makes it easier for platform engineers to reference these properties for creating secrets in Recipes.
  rad resource-type create
  The [rad resource-type create] (https://docs.radapp.io/reference/cli/rad_resource-type_create/) command now supports creating all specified resource types in the yaml definition at once.
  Multiple API versions
  RRTs now support multiple API versions. You can now version your custom resource types with the current date of your choice 2025-07-18-preview following the required format YYYY-MM-DD-preview
  Capabilities Improvements
  - The capabilities: ["SupportsRecipes"] property is deprecated and the Recipe support is enabled by default.
  - Introduced capabilities: ["manualResourceProvisioning"] to support externally provisioned resources. This lets developers connect to resources outside of Radius, while platform engineers expose them via RRTs without needing Recipes.
  Contour Ingress Controller support
  You now have full control over Contour during Kubernetes installation with rad install kubernetes:
  - Use --contour-disabled to skip installing the Contour ingress controller.
  - Use --contour-chart to install from a custom Helm chart. More information [here]https://docs.radapp.io/reference/cli/rad_install_kubernetes/)
  Breaking changes
  None
  Upgrading to Radius v0.49.0
  During our preview stage, an upgrade to Radius v0.49.0 requires a full reinstallation of the Radius control-plane, rad CLI, and all Radius apps. Stay tuned for an in-place upgrade path in the future.
  1. Delete any environments you have created:
     rad env delete <env-name>
  2. Uninstall the previous version of the Radius control-plane:
     rad uninstall kubernetes
  3. Visit the Radius installation guide to install the latest CLI, or download a binary below
  4. Install the latest version of the Radius control-plane:
     rad install kubernetes
