  Announcing Radius v0.50.0
  Today we're happy to announce the release of Radius v0.50.0. Check out the highlights below, along with the full changelog for more details.
  We would like to extend our thanks to all the contributors who helped make this release possible!
  Intro to Radius
  If you're new to Radius, check out our website, radapp.io, for more information. Also visit our getting started guide to learn how to install Radius and create your first app.
  Highlights
  Introducing in-place upgrades
  Radius can now be upgraded using the new rad upgrade command. The new command upgrades the Radius control plane while preserving existing environments and applications. There is also a rad rollback command. Read more in the Radius documentation.
  Enhancements to Radius resource types
  Properties on Radius resource types can now be arrays of objects. You can also now specify an enum type to validate inputs prior to deployment.
  The YAML file schema for resource type definitions changed. name is now namespace. For example, when you use rad resource-type create -f types.yaml to create a new resource type, the types.yaml file must have namespace: Radius.Resources rather than name: Radius.Resources on line one.
  Offline installation
  Radius can now be installed in an offline environment using the rad install command or via the Helm chart by setting location of the Radius containers via the global.imageRegistry and global.imageTag parameters.
  Breaking changes
  The name property in resource type definition YAML file is now namespace. See the Radius resource type section above for details.
  Upgrading to Radius v0.50.0
  You can upgrade to this release by upgrading your Radius CLI then running rad upgrade kubernetes. Only incremental version upgrades are supported. Consult the upgrade documentation for full details.
