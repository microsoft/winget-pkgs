  Announcing Radius v0.51.0
  Today we're happy to announce the release of Radius v0.51.0. Check out the highlights below, along with the full changelog for more details.
  We would like to extend our thanks to all the contributors who helped make this release possible!
  Intro to Radius
  If you're new to Radius, check out our website, radapp.io, for more information. Also visit our getting started guide to learn how to install Radius and create your first app.
  Highlights
  Purge behavior updated for uninstall command
  The existing --purge flag for rad uninstall kubernetes has been updated. When this flag is now specified in the command, all Kubernetes resources created by Radius, including resources created as a part of application deployments, will be deleted. For more information, please refer to the CLI documentation.
  Progress status feedback added to application deletion command
  The rad app delete command has been updated to show deletion progress and confirmation summary in the console output. This fix addresses a usability concern where app deletion operations that take a bit more time make it look like the CLI is frozen. For more information, please refer to the CLI documentation
  ACI deployments now use dynamic resource group location
  Previously, when deploying ACI resources, Radius used a hardcoded WestUS3 location as that was one of the first locations to have the ACI NGroups feature available. This has been fixed where the resource group's location is now dynamically retrieved and used throughout the ACI Environment creation and resource deployment process. See the how-to guide for more information on deploying to ACI using Radius.
  Breaking changes
  Contour ingress controller installation disabled
  Radius no longer automatically installs the Contour ingress controller during rad install kubernetes or rad init. This change is due to Bitnami's deprecation of their public container registry, which affects the availability of Contour images.
  Applications that rely on Radius Gateway resources for ingress functionality will need to manually install and configure a Contour ingress controller before deploying Gateway resources. For more information on how to install Contour, please consult the Contour documentation. Note that Contour may not have updated their documentation yet given the recency of this issue, so we'd also recommend consulting their community discussion on this matter.
  This change is temporary while we evaluate alternative ingress controller options and repository sources.
  Upgrading to Radius v0.51.0
  You can upgrade to this release by upgrading your Radius CLI then running rad upgrade kubernetes. Only incremental version upgrades are supported. Consult the upgrade documentation for full details.
