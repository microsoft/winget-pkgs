  Announcing Radius v0.48.0
  Today we're happy to announce the release of Radius v0.48.0. Check out the highlights below, along with the full changelog for more details.
  We would like to extend our thanks to all the contributors who helped make this release possible!
  Intro to Radius
  If you're new to Radius, check out our website, radapp.io, for more information. Also visit our getting started guide to learn how to install Radius and create your first app.
  Highlights
  Radius Resource Types
  Radius now enables Platform Engineers to define custom Resource Types for use by developers within their enterprise. This is a major step forward, giving platform engineers much greater control over the specific implementation and deployment of cloud resources. Resource Types also make it dramatically easier for developers to follow best practices for security, compliance, and cost management. With Resource Types, developers work with higher-level, familiar abstractions defined by their organization, simplifying workflows and reducing cognitive load. Check out the tutorials to create a PostgreSQL resource type and to create a composite Recipe for a web service resource type.
