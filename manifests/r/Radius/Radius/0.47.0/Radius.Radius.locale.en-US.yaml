  Announcing Radius v0.47.0
  Today we're happy to announce the release of Radius v0.47.0. Check out the highlights below, along with the full changelog for more details.
  We would like to extend our thanks to all the new and existing contributors who helped make this release possible!
  Intro to Radius
  If you're new to Radius, check out our website, radapp.io, for more information. Also visit our getting started guide to learn how to install Radius and create your first app.
  Highlights
  rad version command now also displays control plane version
  The rad version command in the Radius CLI has been updated to display both the CLI version on your machine and the control plane version running in your cluster. This change aims to provide clearer information for users to keep track of versions of the different Radius tools they have installed.
  Gateway Route timeouts configuration
  A timeoutPolicy object has been added to the routes property in the Gateway resource, allowing users to configure custom timeout settings for their Gateway routes. This change offers improved control over request handling to enhance application performance, e.g. adding flexibility for accommodating long-running HTTP calls. For more details, please see the updated Gateway resource reference.
  Deploy Radius applications to Azure Container Instances (ACI)
  Support for deploying applications to Azure Container Instances (ACI) is now available. You can now use Radius to provision an ACI compute environment then, without needing to modify your app definition, deploy applications and containers to the ACI environment. Radius provisions on your behalf all the necessary Azure infrastructure required to run your application. To try this feature, check out the ACI how-to guide.
  Breaking changes
  None.
  Upgrading to Radius v0.47.0
  During our preview stage, an upgrade to Radius v0.47.0 requires a full reinstallation of the Radius control-plane, rad CLI, and all Radius apps. Stay tuned for an in-place upgrade path in the future.

     rad env delete <env-name>
