  Announcing Radius v0.43.0
  Today we're happy to announce the release of Radius v0.43.0. Check out the highlights below, along with the full changelog for more details.
  We would like to extend our thanks to all the new and existing contributors who helped make this release possible!
  Intro to Radius
  If you're new to Radius, check out our website, radapp.io, for more information. Also visit our getting started guide to learn how to install Radius and create your first app.
  Highlights
  DeploymentTemplate Controller
  A new Kubernetes controller in Radius called the DeploymentTemplate Controller is now available that will allow users to deploy resources defined in Bicep manifests using Kubernetes tooling using Radius. This controller was added to enable integrations with GitOps platforms like Flux, which will be available in a future release. Please see the DeploymentTemplate Controller design document for more details.
  Preparations for using PostgreSQL as the Radius database
  In the near future, the Radius data store will be migrated from etcd to a PostgreSQL database. In preparation for this, the Helm chart for installing Radius now includes deploying PostgreSQL to the Kubernetes cluster. There are no changes to Radius when installed via rad init.
  You can follow the progress of moving the Radius data store in this issue.
  rad CLI command for creating new resource types
  We have added a CLI command rad resource-type create to create new resource-types in Radius. This was added to enable resource extensibility in Radius. The end-end functionality of creating and deploying a user-defined resource type will be available in a future release. Learn more from the UDT technical design document

     rad env delete <env-name>
  2. Uninstall the previous version of the Radius control-plane:
     rad uninstall kubernetes
