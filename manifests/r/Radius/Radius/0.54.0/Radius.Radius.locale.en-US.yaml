  Announcing Radius v0.54.0
  Today we're happy to announce the release of Radius v0.54.0. Check out the highlights below, along with the full changelog for more details.
  We would like to extend our thanks to all the new and existing contributors who helped make this release possible!
  Intro to Radius
  If you're new to Radius, check out our website, radapp.io, for more information. Also visit our getting started guide to learn how to install Radius and create your first app.
  Highlights
  Fixed rad workspace show errors when no current workspace exists
  The rad workspace show command was updated to provide a more user-friendly experience when no workspace is currently set. Instead of returning an error, the command now logs an informational message to guide the user. See the CLI docs for more details.
  Fixed rad credential show azure command
  Previously, the rad credential show azure command would always throw an error due to a nil pointer dereference when attempting to display Azure Service Principal credentials. This has been fixed so that the command will now successfully display Azure credentials that you've configured for Radius.
  Breaking changes
  None.
