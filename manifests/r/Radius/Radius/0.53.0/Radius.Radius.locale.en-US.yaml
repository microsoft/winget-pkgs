  Announcing Radius v0.53.0
  Today we're happy to announce the release of Radius v0.53.0. Check out the highlights below, along with the full changelog for more details.
  We would like to extend our thanks to all the new and existing contributors who helped make this release possible!
  Intro to Radius
  If you're new to Radius, check out our website, radapp.io, for more information. Also visit our getting started guide to learn how to install Radius and create your first app.
  Highlights
  Contour ingress controller installation re-enabled
  Thanks to the newly available Contour Helm Charts, Radius has re-enabled installation of the Contour ingress controller during rad install kubernetes or rad init. This means that you no longer need to manually install and configure a Contour ingress controller before deploying Gateway resources.
  Improved Environment deletion experience
  The rad env delete command has been enhanced to make Environment cleanup safer and more transparent. It will now show different prompts for deleting empty vs. populated Environments to help users understand what will be deleted. Furthermore, progress messages during deletion operations have been added to provide clearer progress information during the deletion process.
  New contributors
  Welcome to our new contributors who have merged their first PR in this release!
  - @koksay made their first contribution in #10614
  - @DariuszPorowski made their first contribution in #10771
  Upgrading to Radius v0.53.0
  You can upgrade to this release by upgrading your Radius CLI then running rad upgrade kubernetes. Only incremental version upgrades are supported. Consult the upgrade documentation for full details.
