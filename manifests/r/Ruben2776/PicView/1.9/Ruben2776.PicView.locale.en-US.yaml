ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Introducing a new bottom image gallery that replaces the full-screen gallery and can be utilized in normal window mode.
  - Added support for .thm images, which are used as thumbnails for video files.
  - Expanded support for additional image formats: .fpx, .pcd, and .flif.
  - Updated the file filtering functionality for the Open File Dialog (accessible via Ctrl + O), providing a more refined selection experience.
  - Enhanced visual feedback to indicate active windows more effectively.
  - Korean language updated by @VenusGirl in #110.
  - The full-screen option now opens on the current monitor for improved convenience.
  - Addressed issues with scrolling to the selected image from the first start-up and when performing drag & drop operations with the gallery open.
  - Rectified the keyboard shortcut for flipping images to correctly reflect the orientation of the flip buttons and ensure that the image is flipped back when moving to the next image, if it was already flipped.
  - Resolved the resize function, ensuring it occupies the entire window size when the window is resizable.
  - Made minor updates to UI color schemes for improved visual aesthetics.
  - Fixed the application persisting to run after quitting when the thumbnails are loading in the background.
