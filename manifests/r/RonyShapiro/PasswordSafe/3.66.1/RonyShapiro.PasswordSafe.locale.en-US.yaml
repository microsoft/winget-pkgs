ShortDescription: PasswordSafe - popular secure and convenient password manager
Description: |-
  Password Safe is a password database utility.

  Like many other such products, commercial and otherwise, it stores your passwords in an encrypted
  file, allowing you to remember only one password (the "safe combination"), instead of all the
  username/password combinations that you use.
