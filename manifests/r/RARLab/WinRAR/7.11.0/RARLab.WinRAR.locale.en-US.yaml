ShortDescription: Compress, Encrypt, Package and Backup with only one utility
Description: |-
  - WinRAR is a powerful compression tool with many integrated additional functions to help you organize your compressed archives.
  - WinRAR puts you ahead of the crowd when it comes to compression. By consistently creating smaller archives, WinRAR is often faster than the competition. This will save you disk space, transmission costs AND valuable working time as well.
  - WinRAR supports all popular compression formats (RAR, ZIP, CAB, ARJ, LZH, TAR, GZip, UUE, ISO, BZIP2, Z and 7-Zip).
  - WinRAR is ideal for multimedia files. WinRAR automatically recognizes and selects the best compression method. The special compression algorithm compresses multimedia files, executables and object libraries particularly well.
  - WinRAR allows you to split archives into separate volumes easily, making it possible to save them on several disks.
  - WinRAR is also ideal if you are sending data through the web. Its AES 256-bit encryption and its authenticated signature technology will give you the peace of mind you have been looking for.
  - WinRAR is a trial product, meaning you have the chance to thoroughly test it. The program can be used absolutely free of charge for 40 days!
  - WinRAR licenses are valid for all available language and platform versions. If you have purchased several licenses, you can even mix versions to meet your own personal needs.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  1. If "Add to archive..." Explorer context menu command is applied to
       multiple archives in the disk root, for example, d:\arc1.rar
       and d:\arc2.rar, WinRAR will propose arc1_rar.rar default name
       for a new archive. Previous version proposed arc1.rar, updating one
       of selected archives instead of creating a new one.

    2. Bugs fixed:

       a) WinRAR 7.10 failed to update solid archives containing a folder
          record placed before a file record. It issued the checksum error
          message and aborted processing.

          As a result of this fix, this version preserves the original position
          of such folders after updating and doesn't move them to the end
          of archive as WinRAR 7.10 did;

       b) when extracting a file from CAB archive over an existing file,
          existing files were overwritten, but not truncated.
          So if existing file was larger than extracted, existing file data
          had been left at the end of the extracted file;

       c) if SFX module from "Advanced SFX options" dialog was stored
          in the compression profile, it was applied as is, even if archive
          format was changed after selecting the profile. It could result
          in SFX module mismatching the archive format;

       d) choosing a value in bytes from drop down list associated
          with archive dialog "Split to volumes, size" field didn't set
          units to bytes automatically;

       e) if SFX "TextDone" command was used together with "Silent"
          and "TempMode" commands, the completion message was sometimes
          displayed behind other opened windows;

       f) if symlink pointing at an executable was started from WinRAR shell,
          the executable Mark of the Web data was ignored. We are thankful
          to Shimamine Taihei of Mitsui Bussan Secure Directions, Inc
          for reporting this issue.
