ShortDescription: Compress, Encrypt, Package and Backup with only one utility
Description: |-
  - WinRAR is a powerful compression tool with many integrated additional functions to help you organize your compressed archives.
  - WinRAR puts you ahead of the crowd when it comes to compression. By consistently creating smaller archives, WinRAR is often faster than the competition. This will save you disk space, transmission costs AND valuable working time as well.
  - WinRAR supports all popular compression formats (RAR, ZIP, CAB, ARJ, LZH, TAR, GZip, UUE, ISO, BZIP2, Z and 7-Zip).
  - WinRAR is ideal for multimedia files. WinRAR automatically recognizes and selects the best compression method. The special compression algorithm compresses multimedia files, executables and object libraries particularly well.
  - WinRAR allows you to split archives into separate volumes easily, making it possible to save them on several disks.
  - WinRAR is also ideal if you are sending data through the web. Its AES 256-bit encryption and its authenticated signature technology will give you the peace of mind you have been looking for.
  - WinRAR is a trial product, meaning you have the chance to thoroughly test it. The program can be used absolutely free of charge for 40 days!
  - WinRAR licenses are valid for all available language and platform versions. If you have purchased several licenses, you can even mix versions to meet your own personal needs.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  1. Another directory traversal vulnerability, differing from that
       in WinRAR 7.12, has been fixed.

       When extracting a file, previous versions of WinRAR, Windows versions
       of RAR, UnRAR, portable UnRAR source code and UnRAR.dll can be tricked
       into using a path, defined in a specially crafted archive,
       instead of user specified path.

       Unix versions of RAR, UnRAR, portable UnRAR source code
       and UnRAR library, also as RAR for Android, are not affected.

       We are thankful to Anton Cherepanov, Peter Kosinar, and Peter Strycek
       from ESET for letting us know about this security issue.

    2. Bugs fixed:

       a) WinRAR 7.12 "Import settings from file" command failed to restore
          settings, saved by WinRAR versions preceding 7.12;

       b) WinRAR 7.12 set a larger than specified recovery size for compression
          profiles, created by WinRAR 5.21 and older.
