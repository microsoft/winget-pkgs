ShortDescription: Compress, Encrypt, Package and Backup with only one utility
Description: |-
  - WinRAR is a powerful compression tool with many integrated additional functions to help you organize your compressed archives.
  - WinRAR puts you ahead of the crowd when it comes to compression. By consistently creating smaller archives, WinRAR is often faster than the competition. This will save you disk space, transmission costs AND valuable working time as well.
  - WinRAR supports all popular compression formats (RAR, ZIP, CAB, ARJ, LZH, TAR, GZip, UUE, ISO, BZIP2, Z and 7-Zip).
  - WinRAR is ideal for multimedia files. WinRAR automatically recognizes and selects the best compression method. The special compression algorithm compresses multimedia files, executables and object libraries particularly well.
  - WinRAR allows you to split archives into separate volumes easily, making it possible to save them on several disks.
  - WinRAR is also ideal if you are sending data through the web. Its AES 256-bit encryption and its authenticated signature technology will give you the peace of mind you have been looking for.
  - WinRAR is a trial product, meaning you have the chance to thoroughly test it. The program can be used absolutely free of charge for 40 days!
  - WinRAR licenses are valid for all available language and platform versions. If you have purchased several licenses, you can even mix versions to meet your own personal needs.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  1. "Settings/General" dialog page is split to "Settings/Interface"
        and "Settings/System" pages. Dialog navigation uses vertical tabs
        instead of horizontal.

     2. WinRAR sets the dark interface mode if "Color mode" option
        in "Settings/Interface" is set to "Dark". This option can enable
        dark and light modes unconditionally or use Windows color mode settings.

     3. "Large memory pages" option in "Settings/System" dialog and -mlp
        command line switch enable using 2 MB memory pages instead of
        default 4 KB, when allocating large memory areas in RAR archive
        format compression and extraction routines.

        It allows to improve archiving and, in some cases, extraction speed.
        Typically the performance gain is more significant for bigger
        compression dictionaries and slower compression methods.

        This feature requires "Lock pages in memory" privilege
        and if it is missing, WinRAR proposes to assign it to the current
        user account, making it available for other software too.
        Windows restart is necessary to activate the newly assigned privilege.

     4. "Zone value only" option in "Settings/Security" dialog controls
        if archive Mark of the Web propagation includes only the security zone
        value or all available fields.

        While additional fields, such as a download location or IP address,
        might help to identify a file source, they can be a privacy concern
        if file is shared with other persons.

     5. Switch -om[-|1][=list] controls Mark of the Web propagation
        in WinRAR and console RAR command line mode.

     6. Windows Vista and 32-bit Windows are not supported anymore.
        WinRAR requires Windows 7 x64 or later.

        Unlike WinRAR, 32-bit self-extracting modules are still provided
        as a part of 64-bit installation package.

     7. "Auto", "Always on" and "Disable" choices are now available
        for "Delta compression" and "Executable compression" options
        in "Advanced compression parameters" dialog.

        To improve the compression speed, "Auto" applies these options
        depending on the compression method, such as disabling them
        for "Fastest" and "Fast" methods. Use "Always on" to enable them
        for all methods.

     8. Name of environment variable to store the default set of RAR switches
        is changed from "RAR" to "RARINISWITCHES". It is rather typical
        for batch scripts to use "RAR" environment variable name to store
        RAR executable pathname, which led to the name conflict previously.

     9. "Completion message title" and "Completion message text" options
        on "Text" page of "Advanced SFX options" dialog allow to define
        a custom message displayed on the successful completion of SFX archive
        extraction.

        This message can also be added with "TextDone" script command.

        SFX logo and icon options are moved to the new "Logo and icon" page
        of "Advanced SFX options" dialog. Dialog navigation uses vertical tabs
        instead of horizontal.

    10. Windows 11 context menu:

        a) compression profiles in the new context menu are placed above
           extraction commands, similarly to the legacy context menu;

        b) separator lines are inserted between archive open, extraction
           and archiving command groups.

    11. When extracting a file with NTFS "Compressed" attribute,
        this attribute is assigned in the beginning of file extraction.
        Typically it reduces the extraction time compared to assigning it
        after writing the file data.

    12. When adding files to existing RAR archive, folders previously stored
        in such archive are moved to a position after newly added files.
        So folder timestamps are set after extracting all files and are not
        modified when creating files inside of these folders.

    13. Temporary file isn't created anymore for "rar ch -tl" command if other
        switches or archive parameters do not imply the archive modification.
        Modification time of newest archived file is set directly to original
        archive file, without copying the archive data. It reduces disk write
        and processing time.

    14. If archive is truncated at recovery record or quick open information
        service blocks, the additional message with truncated block type
        is displayed after the standard "Unexpected end of archive".

    15. RAR compression algorithm can use multiple Windows processor groups
        to utilize up to maximum supported 64 logical processors.
        It can improve RAR compression speed on systems with logical
        processors number exceeding 64 and not multiple of 64.

        Previously the maximum number of logical processors was limited
        to a single processor group size, such as 36 for 72 processors.

    16. Additionally to size, a percent of archive size is also displayed
        for recovery record in "Show information" command.

        For RAR 5.0 archives it is the exact value specified when creating
        the recovery record. For older RAR formats it is the approximate value
        calculated from the available data.

    17. When opening a nested archive from another archive opened in WinRAR,
        Mark of the Web data will be assigned to nested archive unless
        "Propagate Mark of the Web" option in WinRAR "Settings/Security"
        is set to "Never". Previously it was assigned only if this option
        was set to "For all files" or to "For user defined types" and list
        of user defined types included the archive extension.

        Also "For office files" and "For executable and office files" lists
        now include popular archive extensions supported by WinRAR.

        Assigning Mark of the Web data to nested archives allows to propagate
        it to files extracted from such archives, which wasn't done by default
        in previous versions.

        We are thankful to Qize Wang (ADLab of VenusTech) for bringing this
        issue to our attention.

    18. Bugs fixed:

        a) if new files have been added to existing semi-solid RAR archive
           created with -se or -s switches, such files could be damaged.
           This issue doesn't affect usual solid archives created with -s,
           also as non-solid archives;

        b) even though the long range search isn't used with -m1 "fastest"
           compression method, switches -m1 -mcl+ or -m1 -mcl with 256MB
           or larger compression dictionary still allocated memory required
           for long range search algorithm;

        c) if "Remove redundant folders from extraction path" option was on
           when extracting a file from archive subfolder, clicking on ".."
           in the file list afterwards displayed the folder with the archive
           file instead of parent folder inside of archive;

        d) if application was started from archive and created multiple files
           with monotonically growing date, WinRAR could issue archive update
           prompts for every created file instead of a single prompt.
