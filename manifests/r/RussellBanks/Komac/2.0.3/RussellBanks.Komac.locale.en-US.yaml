  What's Changed
  - Trim 'v' in version in release artifacts by @vedantmgoyal2009 in #418
  - Topics from the package's GitHub repository are now used for locale manifest tags - Added arm64ec as an architecture to look for in URLs - Fixed crash when previous product code was not a UUID. Product codes are now serialized as Strings instead - #424
  - Fixed an issue where the package version was not being updated in non-default locale manifests - Added -v as a valid alias for the version command - #409 & #428
  - Fixed a specific case of release notes serializing escaped - Fixed crash if exe didn't contain an RT_VERSION resource - #421
  - Fixed crash when parsing a zip as architectures weren't being retrieved from inside an exe - #422- There is a known issue where updating an zip with multiple possible files inside crashes. This will be fixed in the next release - #429
