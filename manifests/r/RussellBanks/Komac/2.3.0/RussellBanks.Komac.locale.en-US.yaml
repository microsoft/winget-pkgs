  What's Changed
  This is a fairly big update compared to usual. As always, please make an issue if you experience any problems or inconsistencies with this update :)Important Changes ‚ùó
  These changes are important to note, especially if you use Komac in automation as they may require changes to your script:- The package identifier is now used as the first argument in all commands that require a package identifier. This matches the syntax of other tools and makes commands shorter to type:
  | Before (<=2.2.1)                                               | After (>=2.3.0)                                   |
  |----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
  | komac update --identifier Package.Identifier --version 1.2.3 | komac update Package.Identifier --version 1.2.3 |- FreeBSD x64 and Linux arm64 builds have been re-added but all x86 and arm builds have been removed - The release assets have been renamed to support cargo-binstall.
