  What's Changed
  This is a fairly big update compared to usual. As always, please make an issue if you experience any problems or inconsistencies with this update :)Important Changes ❗
  These changes are important to note, especially if you use Komac in automation as they may require changes to your script:
  1. The package identifier is now used as the first argument in all commands that require a package identifier. This matches the syntax of other tools and makes commands shorter to type:
  | Before (<=2.2.1)                                               | After (>=2.3.0)                                   |
  |----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
  | komac update --identifier Package.Identifier --version 1.2.3 | komac update Package.Identifier --version 1.2.3 |
  2. FreeBSD x64 and Linux arm64 builds have been re-added but all x86 and arm builds have been removed 3. The release assets have been renamed to support cargo-binstall. This means you can now do cargo binstall komac which can make using Komac in automation across operating systems a lot easier.
  4. OpenSSL is now statically linked on Linux so you no longer need it installed.
