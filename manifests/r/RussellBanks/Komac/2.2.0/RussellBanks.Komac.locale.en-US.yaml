  What's Changed
  OpenSSL is now used on Linux rather than rustls as it was causing some issues for Linux users. These binaries will now be noticably smaller, but will require OpenSSL to be installed.Features
  - Added a show command, similar to WinGet's show command. This outputs the previous manifests for a package identifier, with an optional version parameter:
  - HTTP URLs now get upgraded to HTTPS if their HTTPS equivalent can be successfully reached - #356
  - Get install scope (ALLUSERS) from MSIs
  - Added --created-with and --created-with-url as arguments for external tools that use Komac - #481
  - Added --open-pr to automatically open the created pull request in the default browser
