ReleaseNotes: |-
  What's Changed
  - fix: print url after PR creation by @vedantmgoyal2009 in #134
  - fix: matching algorithm for parameter urls had a slight inconsistency in vedantmgoyal2009/winget-releaser#117 so has been reverted to the algorithm from < 1.2.0, with a minor performance optimisation.
  - fix: using Ctrl+C while URLs that were inputted as a parameter were downloading would not delete the downloading file
  - fix: sub-packages with an all-number name being considered as a previous version
  - fix: url that infinitely redirects would result in a stack overflow. A scenario where a url infinitely redirects would never realistically happen, but Komac now only follows the redirect 5 hops
  - refactor: lots of refactoring in #136 to make the code easier to maintain and smaller (jar without dependencies is about 20% smaller)
  - refactor: use XXH3 hash of branch data at the end of branch name
  - refactor: use crypto Kotlin library for hashing
  - perf: lots of minor performance and memory usage tweaks and improvements
  - tests: significantly improve test coverage
  - chore: turn on more detekt checks
  - fix(deps): update dependency io.kotest.extensions:kotest-assertions-ktor to v2 by @renovate in #135
  - fix(deps): update dependency org.slf4j:slf4j-nop to v2.0.7 by @renovate in #137
  - fix(deps): update dependency com.charleskorn.kaml:kaml to v0.53.0 by @renovate in #138
  - chore(deps): update dependency com.github.johnrengelman.shadow to v8.1.1 by @renovate in #139
