  What's Changed
  This is a big release with lots of fixes and significant improvements to NSIS installer analysis! Komac can now simulate the control flow that a NSIS installer itself would follow, managing a state that includes variables and a mock file system. This allows for retrieving data such as written registry entries for inclusion in the installer manifest's ARP entries.
  Excluding work done in winget-types, this release contains 9,048 additions and 2,395 deletions.
