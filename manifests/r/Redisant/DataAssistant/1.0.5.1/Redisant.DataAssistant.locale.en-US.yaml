Description: |-
  Data Assistant - Quickly create test data in a structured way that can be exported as SQL, CSV, HTML, XML files.

  - Windows Native: Data Assistant uses Windows Native technology, which ensures that the software has a small installation size and high responsiveness.
  - Rapid Generation: Create small or large datasets for rapid prototyping or stress testing of tables, structures and scripts.
  - Real Data: Generate massive, heterogeneous, real data for any development, testing, or demo purpose, instead of just copying and pasting to create repetitive unrealistic text fields.
  - Document based: The data structures you create are preserved intact and different datasets can be created for different purposes.
  - Export data: JSON, SQL, CSV, HTML, XML can be exported, and data structures can be converted to Java, C#, TypeScript, JSONSchema code.
  - Field fine-tuning: you can use optional prefix and suffix for any field; fill the field with random data, specify the length or length range; specify a range for numeric fields; use format strings for date ranges to determine the output content.
