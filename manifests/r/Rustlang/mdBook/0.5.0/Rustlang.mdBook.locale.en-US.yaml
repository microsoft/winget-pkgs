ReleaseNotes: |-
  The 0.5.0 release is the next major release of mdBook, containing over 130 PRs since 0.4.52! The primary focus for this release has been an evolution of the Rust APIs to make it easier to maintain, to evolve in a backwards-compatible fashion, to clean up some things that have accumulated over time, and to significantly improve the performance and compile-times.
  This release also includes many new features described in the CHANGELOG.
  We have prepared a 0.5 Migration Guide to help existing authors switch from 0.4.
