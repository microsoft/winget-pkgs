ShortDescription: The Rust toolchain installer
Description: Rustup installs The Rust Programming Language from the official release channels, enabling you to easily switch between stable, beta, and nightly compilers and keep them updated. It makes cross-compiling simpler with binary builds of the standard library for common platforms. And it runs on all platforms Rust supports, including Windows.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  This new patch release has brought even more tiny fixes and improvements over the previous one.
  The headlines of this release are:
  - The cURL download backend and the native-tls TLS backend are now officially deprecated and a warning will start to show up when they are used. pr#4277
    - While rustup predates reqwest and rustls, the rustup team has long wanted to standardize on an HTTP + TLS stack in Rust, which should increase security, potentially improve performance, and simplify maintenance of the project. With the default download backend already switched to reqwest since 2019, the team thinks it is time to focus maintenance on the Rust-based stack.
    - The rustup team encourages everyone to switch to the reqwest backend with rustls, and would love to hear from you about your use case via GitHub Issues if it does not work well with your particular setup.
  - The version of rustup can be pinned when installing via rustup-init.sh, and rustup self update can be used to upgrade/downgrade rustup v1.28.2+ to a given version. To do so, set the RUSTUP_VERSION environment variable to the desired version (for example 1.28.2).
  - rustup set auto-install disable can now be used to disable automatic installation of the toolchain. This is similar to the RUSTUP_AUTO_INSTALL environment variable introduced in v1.28.1 but with a lower priority. pr#4254
  - Fixed a bug in Nushell integration that might generate invalid commands in the shell configuration. Reinstalling rustup might be required for the fix to work. pr#4265
