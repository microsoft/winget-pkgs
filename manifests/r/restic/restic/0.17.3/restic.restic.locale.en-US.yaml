  Details
  - Bugfix #4971: Fix unusable mount on macOS SonomaOn macOS Sonoma when using FUSE-T, it was not possible to access files in a mounted repository. This issue is now resolved.#4971 #5048
  - Bugfix #5003: Fix metadata errors during backup of removable disks on WindowsSince restic 0.17.0, backing up removable disks on Windows could report errors with retrieving metadata like shown below.
  error: incomplete metadata for d:\filename: get named security info failed with: Access is denied.

  This has now been fixed.#5003 #5123 https://forum.restic.net/t/backing-up-a-folder-from-a-veracrypt-volume-brings-up-errors-since-restic-v17-0/8444
  - Bugfix #5101: Do not retry load/list operation if SFTP connection is brokenWhen using restic with the SFTP backend, backend operations that load a file or list files were retried even if the SFTP connection was broken. This has now been fixed.#5101 https://forum.restic.net/t/restic-hanging-on-backup/8559
  - Bugfix #5107: Fix metadata error on Windows for backups using VSSSince restic 0.17.2, when creating a backup on Windows using --use-fs-snapshot, restic would report an error like the following:
  error: incomplete metadata for C:\: get EA failed while opening file handle for path \\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopyXX\, with: The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process.

  This has now been fixed by correctly handling paths that refer to volume shadow copy snapshots.#5107 #5110 #5112
  - Enhancement #5096: Allow prune --dry-run without lockThe prune --dry-run --no-lock now allows performing a dry-run without locking the repository. Note that if the repository is modified concurrently, prune may return inaccurate statistics or errors.#5096
