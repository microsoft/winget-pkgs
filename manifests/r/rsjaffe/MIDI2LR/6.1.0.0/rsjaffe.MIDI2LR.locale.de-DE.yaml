  New features
  - Fine adjustments This enables more precise adjustments of development parameters than were formerly available. There are new commands under the MIDI2LR develop submenu:
      - Fine 2
      - Fine 4
      - Fine 8
      - Fine 16
      - Fine Off
      - Fine Increase
      - Fine Decreasethat can be assigned to buttons. These buttons engage a "fineness" amount that affects all your adjustments until you cancel fineness. For example, pressing Fine 4 will restrict the editing range to 1/4 of the usual range, centered, if possible, on the current value for all parameters on your controller. Pressing Fine 4 when Fine 4 is already in effect will cancel fineness. Pressing any other Fine number button when Fine 4 is active will change the fineness value to the new numberâ€”for example Fine 16 will reduce the editing range to 1/16 of the usual, again, centered on the current value for each parameter. This works the same for any of the Fine number commands: the first press engages that fineness, the second press cancels it, pressing any other fineness value switches to that one. You can also program a Fine Off button that will cancel fineness no matter what the current value is. Alternatively, you can use the Fine Decrease and Fine Increase buttons. Increase doubles fineness (2, 4, 8, 16, etc.) while Fine Decrease halves it. If you hit Fine Decrease when fineness is 2, it turns off the fineness adjustment.
  - Quick develop Added smaller increment for exposure: 1/6 stop.
  Improvements
  - App startup time reduced significantly.
  - App menus appear quicker.
  Bug fixes
  - Crop adjustments Interaction between different adjustments could, on occasion, cause loss of tracking of MIDI controller values, now fixed.
