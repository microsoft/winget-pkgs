  Read Me First
  Before uninstalling any previous version, please copy them elsewhere beforehand if you have saved your campaign files, logs, or anything else you want to keep under the directory structure where MapTool is installed. It is also a good idea to always have backups.
  Note: Do not install over the top of an old version; either install it in a new directory or uninstall the old version first. If you have installed a beta version of 1.16.0, uninstall that first.
  Platform Notes
  We strongly encourage you to use the installer format for your operating system. The JAR file should only be used by advanced users comfortable installing Java releases. You need to install a working Java with JavaFX on your system to use it.
  Note: if using Ubuntu, you will need Ubuntu 24.04 or later, as the dependencies are not available for earlier versions
  macOS: Use either .pkg (recommended) or .dmg.
  - On macOS, to run the app the first time after installation, hold Ctrl while clicking the icon and continue to hold Ctrl while choosing Open, then choose to open the application (this is part of Apple's approach when dealing with an unidentified developer).
  - The macOS Gatekeeper may flag the DMG file as broken. For more details, see #2679.
