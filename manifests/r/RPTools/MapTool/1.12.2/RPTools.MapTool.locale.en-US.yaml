  Bug Fix Release for MapTool
  This release should fix the issues with disconnects and with the dreaded red Xs.
  Read Me First
  Before uninstalling any previous version, if you have saved your campaign files, logs, or anything else you want to keep under the directory structure where MapTool is installed, please copy them elsewhere beforehand. It is also a good idea to always have backups.
  Note: Do not install over the top of an old version, either install into a new directory or uninstall the old version first.
  Highlights## Changes since 1.12.1
  - #3723 Checkbox to use theme for chatbox colors move to top of theme preferences tab.
  - #3720 Corrected issue with players randomly disconnecting.
  - #3719 Macro function setHalo("None") was throwing NPE. Fixed.
  - #3703 Grid offsets were reset on loaded maps.
  - #3702 Grid offsets were changing on server start. Fixed.
  - #3701 Fixed issue with dropped assets showing as red Xs.
  - #3700 Macro function removeTokenFacing() was throwing NPE. Fixed.

  See full Change Log for more details.
  Platform Notes
  We strongly encourage you to use the installer format for your operating system. The JAR file should only by used by advanced users comfortable with installing Java releases. It requires a working Java 17 install with JavaFX on your system in order to use it.
  Download one of the assets listed below. Each platform has options for which file to download, as described below.
  - Windows: Use either .msi (recommended) or .exe.
    - Recommend that previous 1.12.0 versions be uninstalled prior to installing new one. If you have made modifications to the MapTool.cfg file, make a backup so you can copy your changes into the new config file.
    - Do not install over older versions of MapTool.
    - We're seeing notes from Windows users that they double-click the icon after installing and no window appears. This seems to be an antivirus issue, so check your AV if you have this problem.
  - Linux: Use either .deb, .rpm or .zst (depending on which packager your system uses).
    - The deb version installs under /opt/maptool/bin as MapTool.
  - macOS: Use either .pkg (recommended) or .dmg.
    - On macOS, to run the app the first time after installation, hold Ctrl while clicking the icon and continue to hold Ctrl while choosing Open, then choose to open the application (this is part of Apple's approach when dealing with an unidentified developer).
    - The macOS Gatekeeper may flag the DMG file as broken. See this issue for more details.
    - Note that macOS Ventura has added even more restrictions as Apple further locks down their walled garden. If you're on that OS, check this page for details on how to solve the problem: https://iboysoft.com/news/app-is-damaged-and-cannot-be-opened.html
