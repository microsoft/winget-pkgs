  Platform Notes
  We strongly encourage you to use the installer format for your operating system. The JAR file should only by used by advanced users comfortable with installing Java releases. It requires a working Java 16 install with JavaFX on your system in order to use it.
  Download one of the assets listed below. Each platform has options for which file to download, as described below.
  - Windows: Use either .msi (recommended) or .exe.
    - Recommend that previous 1.10 versions be uninstalled prior to installing new one. If you have made modifications to the MapTool.cfg file, make a backup so you can copy your changes into the new config file.
    - Do not install over older versions of MapTool.
    - We're seeing notes from Windows users that they double-click the icon after installing and no window appears. This seems to be an antivirus issue, so check your AV if you have this problem.
  - Linux: Use either .deb or .rpm (depending on which packager your system uses).
    - The deb version installs under /opt/maptool/bin as MapTool.
  - macOS: Use either .pkg (recommended) or .dmg.
    - On macOS, to run the app the first time after installation, hold Ctrl while clicking the icon and continue to hold Ctrl while choosing Open, then choose to open the application (this is part of Apple's approach when dealing with an unidentified developer).
    - The macOS Gatekeeper may flag the DMG file as broken. See this issue for more details.
