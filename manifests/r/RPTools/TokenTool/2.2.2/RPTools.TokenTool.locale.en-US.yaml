Description: 'TokenTool removes much of the tedium from creating tokens for use with MapTool or your favorite online gaming application. Just drag an image into the background, select a frame, zoom and pan to suit, and drag off a finished token. The resulting token is transparent around the edges and cropped to the size you wanted. '

  Platform Notes
  Download one of the assets listed below. Each platform has options for which file to download, as described below.
  - Windows: Use either .msi or .exe.
    - If you have added custom overlays, they should still be accessible when installing this version over previous versions.
    - We're seeing notes from Windows users that they double-click the icon after installing and no window appears. This seems to be an antivirus issue, so check your AV if you have this problem.
  - Linux: Use either .deb or .rpm (depending on which packager your system uses).
    - The deb version installs under /opt/tokentool/bin as TokenTool.
    - Some Linux distributions have broken native libraries for reading images. If TokenTool crashes with an error regarding how an image may not have a negative width or height, your system has this bug. You can work-around this by deleting the entire Cards directory under Overlays using your system's file manager. (We know the bug exists, but we haven't had a user with this issue offer to help us track it down yet.)
  - macOS: Use either .pkg (recommended) or .dmg.
    - All downloads are for Intel systems and will execute under Rosetta2 on Apple Silicon systems.
    - Run the .pkg installer the first time after installation or drag the application from the .dmg image
    - On first execution, hold Ctrl while clicking the icon and continue to hold Ctrl while choosing Open.
    - Then choose to open the application (this is part of Apple's approach when dealing with an unidentified developer).
    - The Gatekeeper may flag the .dmg file as broken. See RPTools/maptool#2679 for more details.
