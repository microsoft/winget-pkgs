ReleaseNotes: |-
  - NEW: Support for dynamic resolutions in Virtual Mode sessions, which allows RealVNC Server to dynamically change resolution to match the size of the connected RealVNC Viewer window. Note that this feature also requires use of RealVNC Viewer 7.6.0 or later, and if SystemXorg mode is enabled, the RealVNC dummy driver must be installed.
  - IMPROVED: Application icons in RealVNC Connect for Windows are no longer blurry on devices using display scaling set above 100%.
  - FIXED: It is possible to remove all access to RealVNC Server using the Remove button in RealVNC Server's Users & Permissions, instead of automatically reverting to the default access list (Administrators only).
