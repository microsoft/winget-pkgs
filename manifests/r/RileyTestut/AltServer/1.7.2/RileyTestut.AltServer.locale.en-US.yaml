ShortDescription: A companion application for your computer that allows AltStore to sideload apps onto your device.
Description: AltServer is a companion application for your computer that allows AltStore to sideload apps onto your device. As long as AltStore is on the same WiFi network as a computer running AltServer — or is plugged-in directly to the computer via USB — AltStore can sideload, refresh, activate, and deactivate apps. AltServer is also used to install AltStore in the first place, and if your AltStore expires you can manually refresh it by re-installing AltStore with AltServer without deleting AltStore first.
