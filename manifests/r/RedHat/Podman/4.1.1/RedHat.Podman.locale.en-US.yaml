ShortDescription: A daemonless container engine for developing, managing, and running OCI Containers
Description: Podman is a daemonless, open source, Linux native tool designed to make it easy to find, run, build, share and deploy applications using Open Containers Initiative (OCI) Containers and Container Images. Podman provides a command line interface (CLI) familiar to anyone who has used the Docker Container Engine. Most users can simply alias Docker to Podman (alias docker=podman) without any problems. Similar to other common Container Engines (Docker, CRI-O, containerd), Podman relies on an OCI compliant Container Runtime (runc, crun, runv, etc) to interface with the operating system and create the running containers. This makes the running containers created by Podman nearly indistinguishable from those created by any other common container engine.

  Features
  - Podman machine events are now supported on Windows.

  Changes
  - The output of the podman load command now mirrors that of docker load.

  Bugfixes
  - Fixed a bug where the podman play kube command could panic if the --log-opt option was used (#13356).
  - Fixed a bug where Podman could, under some circumstances, fail to parse container cgroup paths (#14146).
  - Fixed a bug where containers created with the --sdnotify=conmon option could send MAINPID twice.
  - Fixed a bug where the podman info command could fail when run inside an LXC container.
  - Fixed a bug where the pause image of a Pod with a custom ID mappings could not be built (BZ 2083997).
  - Fixed a bug where, on podman machine VMs on Windows, containers could be prematurely terminated with API forwarding was not running (#13965).
  - Fixed a bug where removing a container with a zombie exec session would fail the first time, but succeed for subsequent calls (#14252).
  - Fixed a bug where a dangling ID in the database could render Podman unusable.
  - Fixed a bug where containers with memory limits could not be created when Podman was run in a root cgroup (#14236).
  - Fixed a bug where the --security-opt option to podman run and podman create did not support the no-new-privileges:true and no-new-privileges:false options (the only supported separator was =, not :) (#14133).
  - Fixed a bug where containers that did not create a network namespace (e.g. containers created with --network none or --network ns:/path/to/ns) could not be restored from checkpoints (#14389).
  - Fixed a bug where podman-restart.service could, if enabled, cause system shutdown to hang for 90 seconds (#14434).
  - Fixed a bug where the podman stats command would, when run as root on a container that had the podman network disconnect command run on it or that set a custom network interface name, return an error (#13824).
  - Fixed a bug where the remote Podman client's podman pod create command would error when the --uidmap option was used (#14233).
  - Fixed a bug where cleaning up systemd units and timers related to healthchecks was subject to race conditions and could fail.
  - Fixed a bug where the default network mode of containers created by the remote Podman client was assigned by the client, not the server (#14368).
  - Fixed a bug where containers joining a pod that was created with --network=host would receive a private network namespace (#13763).
  - Fixed a bug where podman machine rm --force would remove files related to the VM before stopping it, causing issues if removal was interrupted.
  - Fixed a bug where podman logs would omit the last line of a container's logs if the log did not end in a newline (#14458).
  - Fixed a bug where network cleanup was nonfunctional for containers which used a custom user namespace and were initialized via API (#14465).
  - Fixed a bug where some options (including volumes) for containers that joined pods were overwritten by the infra container (#14454).
  - Fixed a bug where the --file-locks option to podman container restore was ignored, such that file locks checkpointed by podman container checkpoint --file-locks were not restored.
  - Fixed a bug where signals sent to a Podman attach session with --sig-proxy enabled at the exact moment the container that was attached to exited could cause error messages to be printed.
  - Fixed a bug where running the podman machine start command more than once (simultaneously) on the same machine would cause errors.
  - Fixed a bug where the podman stats command could not be run on containers that were not running (it now reports all-0s statistics for Docker compatibility) (#14498).

  API
  - Fixed a bug where images pulled from a private registry could not be accessed via shortname using the Compat API endpoints (#14291).
  - Fixed a bug where the Compat Delete API for Images would return an incorrect status code (500) when attempting to delete images that are in use (#14208).
  - Fixed a bug where the Compat Build API for Images would include the build's STDERR output even if the quiet parameter was true.
  - Fixed a bug where the Libpod Play Kube API would overwrite any log driver specified by query parameter with the system default.

  Misc
  - The podman auto-update command now creates an event when it is run.
  - Error messages printed when Podman's temporary files directory is not writable have been improved.
  - Units for memory limits accepted by Podman commands were incorrectly stated by documentation as megabytes, instead of mebibytes; this has now been corrected (#14187).
