ShortDescription: A daemonless container engine for developing, managing, and running OCI Containers
Description: Podman is a daemonless, open source, Linux native tool designed to make it easy to find, run, build, share and deploy applications using Open Containers Initiative (OCI) Containers and Container Images. Podman provides a command line interface (CLI) familiar to anyone who has used the Docker Container Engine. Most users can simply alias Docker to Podman (alias docker=podman) without any problems. Similar to other common Container Engines (Docker, CRI-O, containerd), Podman relies on an OCI compliant Container Runtime (runc, crun, runv, etc) to interface with the operating system and create the running containers. This makes the running containers created by Podman nearly indistinguishable from those created by any other common container engine.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Security
  - Do not include image annotations when building spec. These annotations can have security implications - crun, for example, allows rootless containers to preserve the user's groups through an annotation.

  Quadlet
  - Fixed a bug in quadlet to recognize the systemd optional prefix '-'.

  Bugfixes
  - Fixed a bug where fully resolving symlink paths included the version number, breaking the path to homebrew-installed qmeu files (#18111).
  - Fixed a bug where Podman was splitting the filter map slightly differently compared to Docker (#18092).
  - Fixed a bug where running make package did not work on RHEL 8 environments (#18421).
  - Fixed a bug to allow comma separated dns server IP addresses in podman network create --dns and podman network update --dns-add/--dns-drop (#18663).
  - Fixed a bug to correctly stop containers created with --restart=always in all cases (#18259).
  - Fixed a bug in podman-remote logs to correctly display errors reported by the server.
  - Fixed a bug to correctly tear down the network stack again when an error happened during the setup.
  - Fixed a bug in the remote API exec inspect call to correctly display updated information, e.g. when the exec process died (#18424).
  - Fixed a bug so that podman save on windows can now write to stdout by default (#18147).
  - Fixed a bug where podman machine rm with the qemu backend now correctly removes the machine connection after the confirmation message not before (#18330).
  - Fixed a problem where podman machine connections would try to connect to the ipv6 localhost ipv6 (::1) (#16470).

  API
  - Fixed a bug in the compat container create endpoint which could result in a "duplicate mount destination" error when the volume path was not "clean", e.g. included a final slash at the end. (#18454).
  - The compat API now correctly accpets a tag in the images/create?fromSrc endpoint (#18597).
