ShortDescription: A daemonless container engine for developing, managing, and running OCI Containers
Description: Podman is a daemonless, open source, Linux native tool designed to make it easy to find, run, build, share and deploy applications using Open Containers Initiative (OCI) Containers and Container Images. Podman provides a command line interface (CLI) familiar to anyone who has used the Docker Container Engine. Most users can simply alias Docker to Podman (alias docker=podman) without any problems. Similar to other common Container Engines (Docker, CRI-O, containerd), Podman relies on an OCI compliant Container Runtime (runc, crun, runv, etc) to interface with the operating system and create the running containers. This makes the running containers created by Podman nearly indistinguishable from those created by any other common container engine.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Security
  - This release fixes CVE-2023-0778, which allowed a malicious user to potentially replace a normal file in a volume with a symlink while exporting the volume, allowing for access to arbitrary files on the host file system.

  Bugfixes
  - Fixed a bug where containers started via the podman-kube systemd template would always use the "passthrough" log driver (#17482).
  - Fixed a bug where pulls would unexpectedly encounter an EOF error. Now, Podman automatically transparently resumes aborted pull connections.
  - Fixed a race condition in Podman's signal proxy.

  Misc
  - Updated the containers/image library to v5.24.1.
