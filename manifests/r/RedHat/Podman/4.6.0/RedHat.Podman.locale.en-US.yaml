ShortDescription: A daemonless container engine for developing, managing, and running OCI Containers
Description: |-
  Podman is a daemonless, open source, Linux native tool designed to make it easy to find, run, build, share and deploy applications using Open Containers Initiative (OCI) Containers and Container Images.
  Podman provides a command line interface (CLI) familiar to anyone who has used the Docker Container Engine.
  Most users can simply alias Docker to Podman (alias docker=podman) without any problems.
  Similar to other common Container Engines (Docker, CRI-O, containerd), Podman relies on an OCI compliant Container Runtime (runc, crun, runv, etc) to interface with the operating system and create the running containers.
  This makes the running containers created by Podman nearly indistinguishable from those created by any other common container engine.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Features
  - The podman manifest inspect command now supports the --authfile option, for authentication purposes.
  - The podman wait command now supports --condition={healthy,unhealthy}, allowing waits on successful health checks.
  - The podman push command now supports a new option,  --compression-level, which specifies the compression level to use (#18939).
  - The podman machine start command, when run with --log-level=debug, now creates a console window to display the virtual machine while booting.
  - Podman now supports a new option, --imagestore, which allows images to be stored in a different directory than the graphroot.
  - The --ip-range option to the podman network create command now accepts a new syntax, <startIP>-<endIP>, which allows more flexibility when limiting the ip range that Podman assigns.
  - [Tech Preview] A new command, podmansh, has been added, which executes a user shell within a container when the user logs into the system.
    The container that the users get added to can be defined via a Podman Quadlet file.
    This feature is currently a Tech Preview which means it's ready for users to try out but changes can be expected in upcoming versions.
  - The podman network create command supports a new --option, bclim, for the macvlan driver.
  - The podman network create command now supports adding static routes using the --route option.
  - The podman network create command supports a new --option, no_default_route for all drivers.
  - The podman info command now prints network information about the binary path, package version, program version and DNS information (#18443).
  - The podman info command now displays the number of free locks available, helping to debug lock exhaustion scenarios.
  - The podman info command now outputs information about pasta, if it exists in helper_binaries_dir or $PATH.
  - The remote Podman client’s podman build command now accepts Containerfiles that are not in the context directory (#18239).
  - The remote Podman client’s podman play kube command now supports the --configmap option (#17513).
  - The podman kube play command now supports multi-doc YAML files for configmap arguments. (#18537).
  - The podman pod create command now supports a new flag, --restart, which sets the restart policy for all the containers in a pod.
  - The --format={{.
    Restarts}} option to the podman ps command now shows the number of times a container has been restarted based on its restart policy.
  - The --format={{.
    Restarts}} option to the podman pod ps command now shows the total number of container restarts in a pod.
  - The podman machine provider can now be specified via the CONTAINERS_MACHINE_PROVIDER environment variable, as well as via the provider field in containers.conf (#17116).
  - A default list of pasta arguments can now be set in containers.conf via pasta_options.
  - The podman machine init and podman machine set commands now support a new option, --user-mode-networking, which improves interops with VPN configs that drop traffic from WSL networking, on Windows.
  - The remote Podman client’s podman push command now supports the --digestfile option (#18216).
  - Podman now supports a new option, --out, that allows redirection or suppression of STDOUT (#18120).
  Changes
  - When looking up an image by digest, the entire repository of the specified value is now considered.
    This aligns with Docker's behavior since v20.10.20.
    Previously, both the repository and the tag was ignored and Podman looked for an image with only a matching digest.
    Ignoring the name, repository, and tag of the specified value can lead to security issues and is considered harmful.
  - The podman system service command now emits a warning when binding to a TCP socket.
    This is not a secure configuration and the Podman team recommends against using it.
  - The podman top command no longer depends on ps(1) being present in the container image and now uses the one from the host (#19001).
  - The --filter id=xxx option will now treat xxx as a CID prefix, and not as a regular expression (#18471).
  - The --filter option now requires multiple --filter flags to specify multiple filters.
    It will no longer support the comma syntax (--filter label=a,label=b).
  - The slirp4netns binary for will now be searched for in paths specified by the helper_binaries_dir option in containers.conf (#18239).
  - Podman machine now updates /run/docker.sock within the guest to be consistent with its rootless/rootful setting (#18480).
  - The podman system df command now counts files which podman generates for use with specific containers as part of the disk space used by those containers, and which can be reclaimed by removing those containers.
    It also counts space used by files it associates with specific images and volumes as being used by those images and volumes.
  - The podman build command now returns a clearer error message when the Containerfile cannot be found. (#16354).
  - Containers created with --pid=host will no longer print errors on podman stop (#18460).
  - The podman manifest push command no longer requires a destination to be specified.
    If a destination is not provided, the source is used as the destination (#18360).
  - The podman system reset command now warns the user that the graphroot and runroot directories will be deleted (#18349), (#18295).
  - The package and package-install targets in Makefile have now been fixed and also renamed to rpm and rpm-install respectively for clarity (#18817).
  Quadlet
  - Quadlet now exits with a non-zero exit code when errors are found (#18778).
  - Rootless podman quadlet files can now be installed in /etc/containers/systemd/users directory.
  - Quadlet now supports the AutoUpdate option.
  - Quadlet now supports the Mask and Unmask options.
  - Quadlet now supports the WorkingDir option, which specifies the default working dir in a container.
  - Quadlet now supports the Sysctl option, which sets namespaced kernel parameters for containers (#18727).
  - Quadlet now supports the SecurityLabelNetsted=true option, which allows nested SELinux containers.
  - Quadlet now supports the Pull option in .container files (#18779).
  - Quadlet now supports the ExitCode field in .kube files, which reflects the exit codes of failed containers.
  - Quadlet now supports PodmanArgs field.
  - Quadlet now supports the HostName field, which sets the container's host name, in .container files (#18486).
  Bugfixes
  - Fixed a bug where the podman machine start command would fail with a 255 exit code.
    It now waits for systemd-user sessions to be up, and for SSH to be ready, addressing the flaky machine starts (#17403).
  - Fixed a bug where the podman auto update command did not correctly use authentication files when contacting container registries.
  - Fixed a bug where --label option to the podman volume ls command would return volumes that matched any of the filters, not all of them  (#19219).
  - Fixed a bug where the podman kube play command did not recognize containerPort names inside Kubernetes liveness probes.
    Now, liveness probes support both containerPort names as well as port numbers (#18645).
  - Fixed a bug where the --dns option to the podman run command was ignored for macvlan networks (#19169).
  - Fixed a bug in the podman system service command where setting LISTEN_FDS when listening on TCP would misbehave.
  - Fixed a bug where hostnames were not recognized as a network alias.
    Containers can now resolve other hostnames, in addition to their names (#17370).
  - Fixed a bug where the podman pod run command would error after a reboot on a non-systemd system (#19175).
  - Fixed a bug where the --syslog option returned a fatal error when no syslog server was found (#19075).
  - Fixed a bug where the --mount option would parse the readonly option incorrectly (#18995).
  - Fixed a bug where hook executables invoked by the podman run command set an incorrect working directory.
    It now sets the correct working directory pointing to the container bundle directory (#18907).
  - Fixed a bug where the -device-cgroup-rule option was silently ignored in rootless mode (#18698).
  - Listing images is now more resilient towards concurrently running image removals.
  - Fixed a bug where the --force option to the podman kube down command would not remove volumes (#18797).
  - Fixed a bug where setting the --list-tags option in the podman search command would cause the command to ignore the --format option (#18939).
  - Fixed a bug where the podman machine start command did not properly translate the proxy IP.
  - Fixed a bug where the podman auto-update command would not restart dependent units (specified via Requires=) on auto update (#18926).
  - Fixed a bug where the podman pull command would print ids multiple times when using additional stores (#18647).
  - Fixed a bug where creating a container while setting unmask option to an empty array would cause the create to fail (#18848).
  - Fixed a bug where the propagation of proxy settings for QEMU VMs was broken.
  - Fixed a bug where the podman rm -fa command could fail to remove dependency containers such as pod infra containers (#18180).
  - Fixed a bug  where  --tz option to the podman create  and podman run commands would not create a proper localtime symlink to the zoneinfo file, which was causing some applications (e.g. java) to not read the timezone correctly.
  - Fixed a bug where lowering the ulimit after container creation would cause the container to fail (#18714).
  - Fixed a bug where signals were not forwarded correctly in rootless containers (#16091).
  - Fixed a bug where the --filter volume= option to the podman events command would not display the relevant events (#18618).
  - Fixed a bug in the podman wait command where containers created with the --restart=always option would result in the container staying in a stopped state.
  - Fixed a bug where the podman stats command returned an incorrect memory limit after a container update. (#18621).
