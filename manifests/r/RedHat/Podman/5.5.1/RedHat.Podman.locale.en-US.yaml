ShortDescription: A daemonless container engine for developing, managing, and running OCI Containers
Description: |-
  Podman is a daemonless, open source, Linux native tool designed to make it easy to find, run, build, share and deploy applications using Open Containers Initiative (OCI) Containers and Container Images.
  Podman provides a command line interface (CLI) familiar to anyone who has used the Docker Container Engine.
  Most users can simply alias Docker to Podman (alias docker=podman) without any problems.
  Similar to other common Container Engines (Docker, CRI-O, containerd), Podman relies on an OCI compliant Container Runtime (runc, crun, runv, etc) to interface with the operating system and create the running containers.
  This makes the running containers created by Podman nearly indistinguishable from those created by any other common container engine.

  Bugfixes
  - Fixed a bug where containers mounting a volume to / could overmount important directories such as /proc causing start and/or runtime failures due to an issue with mount ordering (#26161).
  - Fixed a bug where Quadlet .pod units could fail to start due to their storage not being mounted (#26190).
  - Fixed a bug where containers joined to a network with DNS enabled would not include the host's search domains in their resolv.conf (#24713).
  - Fixed a bug where the --dns-opt option to podman create, podman run, and podman pod create would append options to the container's resolv.conf, instead of replacing them (#22399).
  - Fixed a bug where the podman kube play command would add an empty network alias for containers created with no name specified, causing Netavark to emit extraneous warnings.
  - Fixed a bug where the podman system df command would panic when one or more containers were created using a root filesystem (the --rootfs option to podman create and podman run) instead of from an image (#26224).
  - Fixed a bug where the log_tag field in containers.conf would override the --log-opt tag=value option to podman create and podman run (#26236).
  - Fixed a bug where the podman volume rm and podman volume inspect commands would incorrectly handle volume names containing the _ character when the SQLite database backend was in use (#26168).
  - Fixed a bug where the Podman remote client on Windows was unable to mount local folders into containers using overlay mounts (-v source:destination:O) (#25988).
  API
  - Fixed a bug in the Libpod Create API for Containers where rlimits specified with a value of -1 were causing errors, instead of being interpreted as the maximum possible value (#24886).
  - Fixed a bug in the Compat Create API for Containers where specifying an entrypoint of [] (an empty array) was ignored, instead of setting an empty entrypoint (#26078).
  Misc
  - Updated Buildah to v1.40.1
  - Updated the containers/common library to v0.63.1
