ShortDescription: A daemonless container engine for developing, managing, and running OCI Containers
Description: Podman is a daemonless, open source, Linux native tool designed to make it easy to find, run, build, share and deploy applications using Open Containers Initiative (OCI) Containers and Container Images. Podman provides a command line interface (CLI) familiar to anyone who has used the Docker Container Engine. Most users can simply alias Docker to Podman (alias docker=podman) without any problems. Similar to other common Container Engines (Docker, CRI-O, containerd), Podman relies on an OCI compliant Container Runtime (runc, crun, runv, etc) to interface with the operating system and create the running containers. This makes the running containers created by Podman nearly indistinguishable from those created by any other common container engine.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Security
  - Now the io.containers.capabilities LABEL in an image can be an empty string.

  Features
  - New command set: podman farm [create,list,remove,update] has been created to "farm" out builds to machines running Podman for different architectures.
  - New command: podman compose as a thin wrapper around an external compose provider such as docker-compose or podman-compose.
  - FreeBSD: podman run --device is now supported.
  - Linux: Add a new --module flag for Podman.
  - Podmansh: Timeout is now configurable using the podmansh_timeout option in containers.conf.
  - SELinux: Add support for confined users to create containers but restrict them from creating privileged containers.
  - WSL: Registers shared socket bindings on Windows, to allow other WSL distributions easy remote access (#15190).
  - WSL: Enabling user-mode-networking on older WSL2 generations will now detect an error with upgrade guidance.
  - The podman build command now supports two new options: --layer-label and --cw.
  - The podman kube generate command now supports generation of k8s DaemonSet kind (#18899).
  - The podman kube generate and podman kube play commands now support the k8s TerminationGracePeriodSeconds field (RH BZ#2218061).
  - The podman kube generate and podman kube play commands now support securityContext.procMount: Unmasked (#19881).
  - The podman generate kube command now supports a --podman-only flag to allow podman-only reserved annotations to be used in the generated YAML file. These annotations cannot be used by Kubernetes.
  - The podman kube generate now supports a --no-trunc flag that supports YAML files with annotations longer than 63 characters. Warning: if an annotation is longer than 63 chars, then the generated yaml file is not Kubernetes compatible.
  - An infra name annotation io.podman.annotations.infra.name is added in the generated yaml when the pod create command has --infra-name set. This annotation can also be used with kube play when wanting to customize the infra container name (#18312).
  - The syntax of --uidmap and --gidmap has been extended to lookup the parent user namespace and to extend default mappings (#18333).
  - The podman kube commands now support the List kind (#19052).
  - The podman kube play command now supports environment variables in kube.yaml (#15983).
  - The podman push and podman manifest push commands now support the --force-compression optionto prevent reusing other blobs (#18860).
  - The podman manifest push command now supports --add-compression to push with compressed variants.
  - The podman manifest push command now honors the add_compression field from containers.conf if --add-compression is not set.
  - The podman run and podman create --mount commands now support the ramfs type (#19659).
  - When running under systemd (e.g., via Quadlet), Podman will extend the start timeout in 30 second steps up to a maximum of 5 minutes when pulling an image.
  - The --add-host option now accepts the special string host-gateway instead of an IP Address, which will be mapped to the host IP address.
  - The podman generate systemd command is deprecated. Use Quadlet for running containers and pods under systemd.
  - The podman secret rm command now supports an --ignore option.
  - The --env-file option now supports multiline variables (#18724).
  - The --read-only-tmpfs flag now affects /dev and /dev/shm as well as /run, /tmp, /var/tmp (#12937).
  - The Podman --mount option now supports bind mounts passed as globs.
  - The --mount option can now be specified in containers.conf using the mounts field.
  - The podman stats now has an --all option to get all containers stats (#19252).
  - There is now a new --sdnotify=healthy policy where Podman sends the READY message once the container turns healthy (#6160).
  - Temporary files created when dealing with images in /var/tmp will automatically be cleaned up on reboot.
  - There is now a new filter option since for podman volume ls and podman volume prune (#19228).
  - The podman inspect command now has tab-completion support (#18672).
  - The podman kube play command now has support for the use of reserved annotations in the generated YAML.
  - The progress bar is now displayed when decompressing a Podman machine image (#19240).
  - The podman secret inspect command supports a new option --showsecret which will output the actual secret.
  - The podman secret create now supports a --replace option, which allows you to modify secrets without replacing containers.
  - The podman login command can now read the secret for a registry from its secret database created with podman secret create (#18667).
  - The remote Podman clientâ€™s podman play kube command now works with the --userns option (#17392).

  Changes
  - The /tmp and /var/tmp inside of a podman kube play will no longer be noexec.
  - The limit of inotify instances has been bumped from 128 to 524288 for podman machine (#19848).
  - The podman kube play has been improved to only pull a newer image for the "latest" tag (#19801).
  - Pulling from an oci transport will use the optional name for naming the image.
  - The podman info command will always display the existence of the Podman socket.
  - The echo server example in socket_activation.md has been rewritten to use quadlet instead of podman generate systemd.
  - Kubernetes support table documentation correctly show volumes support.
  - The podman auto-update manpage and documentation has been updated and now includes references to Quadlet.

  Quadlet
  - Quadlet now supports setting Ulimit values.
  - Quadlet now supports setting the PidsLimit option in a container.
  - Quadlet unit files allow DNS field in Network group and DNS, DNSSearch, and DNSOption field in Container group (#19884).
  - Quadlet now supports ShmSize option in unit files.
  - Quadlet now recursively calls in user directories for unit files.
