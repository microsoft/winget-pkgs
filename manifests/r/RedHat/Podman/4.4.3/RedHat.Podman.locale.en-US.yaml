ShortDescription: A daemonless container engine for developing, managing, and running OCI Containers
Description: Podman is a daemonless, open source, Linux native tool designed to make it easy to find, run, build, share and deploy applications using Open Containers Initiative (OCI) Containers and Container Images. Podman provides a command line interface (CLI) familiar to anyone who has used the Docker Container Engine. Most users can simply alias Docker to Podman (alias docker=podman) without any problems. Similar to other common Container Engines (Docker, CRI-O, containerd), Podman relies on an OCI compliant Container Runtime (runc, crun, runv, etc) to interface with the operating system and create the running containers. This makes the running containers created by Podman nearly indistinguishable from those created by any other common container engine.

  Security
  - This release fixes CVE-2022-41723, a vulnerability in the golang.org/x/net package where a maliciously crafted HTTP/2 stream could cause excessive CPU consumption, sufficient to cause a denial of service.

  Changes
  - Added SYS_CHROOT back to the default set of capabilities.

  Bugfixes
  - Fixed a bug where quadlet would not use the default runtime set.
  - Fixed a bug where podman system service --log-level=trace did not hijack the client connection, causing remote podman run/attach calls to work incorrectly (#17749).
  - Fixed a bug where the podman-mac-helper returned an incorrect exit code after erroring. podman-mac-helper now exits with 1 on error (#17785).
  - Fixed a bug where podman run --dns ... --network would not respect the dns option. Podman will no longer add host nameservers to resolv.conf when aardvark-dns is used (#17499).
  - Fixed a bug where podman logs errored out with the passthrough driver when the container was run from a systemd service.
  - Fixed a bug where --health-on-failure=restart would not restart the container when the health state turned unhealthy (#17777).
  - Fixed a bug where podman machine VMs could have their system time drift behind real time. New machines will no longer be affected by this (#11541).

  API
  - Fixed a bug where creating a network with the Compat API would return an incorrect status code. The API call now returns 409 when creating a network with an existing name and when CheckDuplicate is set to true (#17585).
  - Fixed a bug in the /auth REST API where logging into Docker Hub would fail (#17571).

  Misc
  - Updated the containers/common library to v0.51.1
  - Updated the Mac pkginstaller QEMU to v7.2.0
