ShortDescription: A daemonless container engine for developing, managing, and running OCI Containers
Description: |-
  Podman is a daemonless, open source, Linux native tool designed to make it easy to find, run, build, share and deploy applications using Open Containers Initiative (OCI) Containers and Container Images.
  Podman provides a command line interface (CLI) familiar to anyone who has used the Docker Container Engine.
  Most users can simply alias Docker to Podman (alias docker=podman) without any problems.
  Similar to other common Container Engines (Docker, CRI-O, containerd), Podman relies on an OCI compliant Container Runtime (runc, crun, runv, etc) to interface with the operating system and create the running containers.
  This makes the running containers created by Podman nearly indistinguishable from those created by any other common container engine.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Features
  - VMs created by podman machine on macOS with Apple silicon can now use Rosetta 2 (a.k.a Rosetta) for high-speed emulation of x86 code. This is enabled by default. If you wish to change this option, you can use the CONTAINERS_MACHINE_ROSETTA environment variable or containers.conf.
  - Changes made by the podman update command are now persistent, and will survive container restart and be reflected in podman inspect.
  - The podman update command now includes a new option, --restart, to update the restart policy of existing containers.
  - Quadlet .container files now support a new key, GroupAdd, to add groups to the container.
  - Container annotations are now printed by podman inspect.
  - Image-based mounts using podman run --mount type=image,... now support a new option, subpath, to mount only part of the image into the container.
  - A new field, healthcheck_events, has been added to containers.conf under the [engine] section to allow users to disable the generation of health_status events to avoid spamming logs on systems with many healthchecks.
  - A list of images to automatically mount as volumes can now be specified in Kubernetes YAML via the io.podman.annotations.kube.image.automount/$CTRNAME annotation (where $CTRNAME is the name of the container they will be mounted into).
  - The podman info command now includes the default rootless network command (pasta or slirp4netns).
  - The podman ps command now shows ports from --expose that have not been published with --publish-all to improve Docker compatibility.
  - The podman runlabel command now expands $HOME in the label being run to the user's home directory.
  - A new alias, podman network list, has been added to the podman network ls command.
  - The name and shell of containers created by podmansh can now be set in containers.conf.
  - The podman-setup.exe Windows installer now provides 3 new CLI variables, MachineProvider (choose the provider for the machine, windows or wsl, the default), HyperVCheckbox (can be set to 1 to install HyperV if it is not already installed or 0, the default, to not install HyperV), and SkipConfigFileCreation (can be set to 1 to disable the creation of configuration files, or 0, the default).
  Changes
  - Podman now changes volume ownership every time an empty named volume is mounted into a container, not just the first time, matching Docker's behavior.
  - When running Kubernetes YAML with podman kube play that does not include an imagePullPolicy and does not set a tag for the image, the image is now always pulled (#21211).
  - When running Kubernetes YAML with podman kube play, pod-level restart policies are now passed down to individual containers within the pod (#20903).
  - The --runroot global option can now accept paths with lengths longer than 50 characters (#22272).
  - Updating containers with the podman update command now emits an event.
  Bugfixes
  - Fixed a bug where the --userns=keep-id:uid=0 option to podman create and podman run would generate incorrect UID mappings and cause the container to fail to start (#22078).
  - Fixed a bug where podman stats could report inaccurate percentages for very large or very small values (#22064).
  - Fixed a bug where bind-mount volumes defaulted to rbind instead of bind, meaning recursive mounts were allowed by default (#22107).
  - Fixed a bug where the podman machine rm -f command would fail to remove Hyper-V virtual machines if they were running.
  - Fixed a bug where the podman ps --sync command could sometimes fail to properly update the status of containers.
  - Fixed a bug where bind-mount volumes using the :idmap option would sometimes be inaccessible with rootless Podman (#22228).
  - Fixed a bug where bind-mount volumes using the :U option would have their ownership changed to the owner of the directory in the image being mounted over (#22224).
  - Fixed a bug where removing multiple containers, pods, or images with the --force option did not work when multiple arguments were given to the command and one of them did not exist (#21529).
  - Fixed a bug where Podman did not properly clean up old cached Machine images.
  - Fixed a bug where rapidly-restarting containers with healthchecks could sometimes fail to start their healthchecks after restarting.
  - Fixed a bug where nested Podman could create its pause.pid file in an incorrect directory (#22327).
  - Fixed a bug where Podman would panic if an OCI runtime was configured without associated paths in containers.conf (#22561).
  - Fixed a bug where the podman kube down command would not respect the StopTimeout and StopSignal of containers that it stopped (#22397).
  - Fixed a bug where Systemd-managed containers could be stuck in the Stopping state, unable to be restarted, if systemd killed the unit before podman stop finished stopping the container (#19629).
  - Fixed a bug where the remote Podman client's podman farm build command would not updating manifests on the registry that were already pushed (#22647).
  - Fixed a bug where rootless Podman could fail to re-exec itself when run with a custom argv[0] that is not a valid command path, as might happen when used in podmansh (#22672).
  - Fixed a bug where podman machine connection URIs could be incorrect after an SSH port conflict, rendering machines inaccessible.
  - Fixed a bug where the podman events command would not print an error if incorrect values were passed to its --since and --until options.
  - Fixed a bug where an incorrect host.containers.internal entry could be added when running rootless containers using the bridge network mode (#22653).
  API
  - A new Docker-compatible endpoint, Update, has been added for containers.
  - The Compat Create endpoint for Containers now supports setting container annotations.
  - The Libpod List endpoint for Images now includes additional information in its responses (image architecture, OS, and whether the image is a manifest list) (#22184 and #22185).
  - The Build endpoint for Images no longer saves the build context as a temporary file, substantially improving performance and reducing required filesystem space on the server.
  - The Inspect API for Containers now returns results compatible with Podman v4.x when a request with version v4.0.0 is made. This allows Podman 4.X remote clients work with a Podman 5.X server (#22657).
  - Fixed a bug where the Build endpoint for Images would not clean up temporary files created by the build if an error occurred.
  Misc
  - Podman now detects unhandled system reboots and advises the user on proper mitigations.
  - Improved debugging output for podman machine on Darwin systems when --log-level=debug is used.
  - The Makefile now allows injecting extra build tags via the EXTRA_BUILD_TAGS environment variable.
  - Updated Buildah to v1.36.0
  - Updated the containers/common library to v0.59.0
  - Updated the containers/image library to v5.31.0
  - Updated the containers/storage library to v1.54.0
