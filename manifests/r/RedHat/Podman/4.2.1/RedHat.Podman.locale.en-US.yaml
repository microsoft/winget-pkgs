ShortDescription: A daemonless container engine for developing, managing, and running OCI Containers
Description: Podman is a daemonless, open source, Linux native tool designed to make it easy to find, run, build, share and deploy applications using Open Containers Initiative (OCI) Containers and Container Images. Podman provides a command line interface (CLI) familiar to anyone who has used the Docker Container Engine. Most users can simply alias Docker to Podman (alias docker=podman) without any problems. Similar to other common Container Engines (Docker, CRI-O, containerd), Podman relies on an OCI compliant Container Runtime (runc, crun, runv, etc) to interface with the operating system and create the running containers. This makes the running containers created by Podman nearly indistinguishable from those created by any other common container engine.

  Features
  - Added support for Sigstore signatures (sigstoreSigned) to the podman image trust set and podman image trust show commands.`
  - The podman image trust show command now recognizes new lookaside field names.
  - The podman image trust show command now recognizes keyPaths in signedBy entries.

  Changes
  - BREAKING CHANGE: podman image trust show may now show multiple entries for the same scope, to better represent separate requirements. GPG IDs on a single row now always represent alternative keys, only one of which is required; if multiple sets of keys are required, each is re
  - presented by a single line.
  - The podman generate kube command no longer adds the bind-mount-options annotation to generated Service YAML (#15208).

  Bugfixes
  - Fixed a bug where Podman could deadlock when using podman kill to send signals to containers (#15492).
  - Fixed a bug where the podman image trust set command would silently discard unknown fields.
  - Fixed a bug where the podman image trust show command would not show signature enforcement configuration for the default scope.
  - Fixed a bug where the podman image trust show command would silently ignore multiple kinds of requirements in a single scope.
  - Fixed a bug where a typo in the podman-kube@.service unit file would cause warnings when running systemctl status on the unit.
  - Fixed a bug where the --compress option to podman image save was incorrectly allowed with the oci-dir format.
  - Fixed a bug where the podman container clone command did not properly clone environment variables (#15242).
  - Fixed a bug where Podman would not accept environment variables with whitespace in their keys (#15251).
  - Fixed a bug where Podman would not accept file paths containing the : character, preventing some commands from being used with podman machine on Windows (#15247).
  - Fixed a bug where the podman top command would report new capabilities as unknown.
  - Fixed a bug where running Podman in a container could cause fatal errors about an inability to create cgroups (#15498).
  - Fixed a bug where the podman generate kube command could generate incorrect YAML when the bind-mount-options was used (#15170).
  - Fixed a bug where generated container names were deterministic, instead of random (#15569).
  - Fixed a bug where the podman events command would not work with custom --format specifiers (#15648).

  API
  - Fixed a bug where the Compat List endpoint for Containers did not sort the HostConfig.Binds field as Docker does.
  - Fixed a bug where the Compat List endpoint for Containers send the name (instead of ID) of the image the container was based on.
  - Fixed a bug where the Compat Connect endpoint for Networks would return an error (instead of 200) when attempting to connect a container to a network it was already connected to (#15499).
  - Fixed a bug where the Compat Events endpoint set an incorrect status for image removal events (remove instead of delete) (#15485).
