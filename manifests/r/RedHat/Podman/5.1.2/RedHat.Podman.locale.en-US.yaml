ShortDescription: A daemonless container engine for developing, managing, and running OCI Containers
Description: |-
  Podman is a daemonless, open source, Linux native tool designed to make it easy to find, run, build, share and deploy applications using Open Containers Initiative (OCI) Containers and Container Images.
  Podman provides a command line interface (CLI) familiar to anyone who has used the Docker Container Engine.
  Most users can simply alias Docker to Podman (alias docker=podman) without any problems.
  Similar to other common Container Engines (Docker, CRI-O, containerd), Podman relies on an OCI compliant Container Runtime (runc, crun, runv, etc) to interface with the operating system and create the running containers.
  This makes the running containers created by Podman nearly indistinguishable from those created by any other common container engine.

  Bugfixes
  - Fixed a bug that would sometimes prevent the mount of some podman machine volumes into the virtual machine when using the Apple hypervisor (#22569).
  - Fixed a bug where podman top would show the incorrect UID for processes in containers run in a user namespace (#22293).
  - Fixed a bug where the /etc/hosts and /etc/resolv.conf files in a container would be empty after restoring from a checkpoint (#22901).
  - Fixed a bug where the --pod-id-file argument to podman run and podman create did not respect the pod's user namespace (#22931).
  - Fixed a bug in the Podman remote client where specifying a invalid connection in the CONTAINER_CONNECTION environment variable would lead to a panic.
  Misc
  - Virtual machines run by podman machine using the Apple hypervisor now wait 90 seconds before forcibly stopping the VM, matching the standard systemd shutdown timeout (#22515).
  - Updates the containers/image library to v5.31.1
