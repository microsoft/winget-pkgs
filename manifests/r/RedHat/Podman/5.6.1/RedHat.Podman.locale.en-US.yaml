ShortDescription: A daemonless container engine for developing, managing, and running OCI Containers
Description: |-
  Podman is a daemonless, open source, Linux native tool designed to make it easy to find, run, build, share and deploy applications using Open Containers Initiative (OCI) Containers and Container Images.
  Podman provides a command line interface (CLI) familiar to anyone who has used the Docker Container Engine.
  Most users can simply alias Docker to Podman (alias docker=podman) without any problems.
  Similar to other common Container Engines (Docker, CRI-O, containerd), Podman relies on an OCI compliant Container Runtime (runc, crun, runv, etc) to interface with the operating system and create the running containers.
  This makes the running containers created by Podman nearly indistinguishable from those created by any other common container engine.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Security
  - This release addresses CVE-2025-9566, where Kubernetes YAML run by podman play kube containing ConfigMap and Secret volumes can use crafted symlinks to overwrite content on the host.
  Bugfixes
  - Fixed a bug where network creation and removal events were displayed incorrectly when the journald events driver was in use.
  - Fixed a bug where the --security-opt seccomp=unconfined option was broken on Windows (#26855).
  - Fixed a bug where containers created with a name longer than 64 characters, no explicit hostname, the the container_name_as_hostname option in containers.conf set to true would fail to start.
  - Fixed a bug where Podman would fail to start containers when runc 1.3.0 or later was used as the OCI runtime (#26938).
  Misc
  - Adjusted the systemd-tmpfiles script to recursively remove temporary files directories placed in /tmp, ensuring proper operation of Podman after a reboot if /tmp is not a tmpfs.
  - Updated Buildah to v1.41.4
  - Updated the containers/storage to v1.59.1
  - Updated the containers/common library to v0.64.2
