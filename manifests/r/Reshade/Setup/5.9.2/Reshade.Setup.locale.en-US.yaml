ShortDescription: Post-processing injector for games and video software
Description: |-
  Injector with a GUI where you can select the game, shaders and presets to inject.
  Imagine your favorite game with ambient occlusion, real depth of field effects, color correction and more ...
  ReShade exposes an automated and generic way to access both frame color and depth information (latter is automatically disabled during multiplayer to prevent exploitation) and all the tools to make it happen.
  ReShade features its very own shading language and compiler, called ReShade FX.
  The syntax is based on HLSL, adding useful features designed for developing post-processing effects: Define and use textures right from the shader code, render to them, change renderstates, retrieve color and depth data, request custom values like timers or key states, ...
  For full add-ons support, which might get caught by multiplayer anticheat, please see the Reshade.Setup.AddonsSupport package.
ReleaseNotes: |-
  Added missing hooks for "vkQueueSubmit2KHR" and "vkCmdWriteTimestamp2KHR"
  Added application ID to first message written to log
  Changed message window to use same style as the rest of the overlay
  Fixed depth buffer detection in Baldur's Gate 3 with Vulkan
  Fixed depth buffer leak when selection switches to a different one
  Fixed framerate plot on Statistics page showing broken data
  Fixed HLSL shader model 3 code generation when mixing custom semantics and "TEXCOORD"
  Fixed incorrect render target and storage access flags set on pooled textures

  Fixed setup tool crash when unselecting an effect file that is not installed anyway
