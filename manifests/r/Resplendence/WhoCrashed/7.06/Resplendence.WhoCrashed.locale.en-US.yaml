ShortDescription: Comprehensible crash dump analysis, find out why your system crashed.
Description: |-
  'WhoCrashed reveals the drivers responsible for crashing your computer

  Whenever a computer running Windows suddenly reboots without displaying any notice or blue or black screen of death, the first thing that is often thought about is a hardware failure.
  In reality, crashes are often caused by malfunctioning device drivers and kernel modules.
  In case of a kernel error, computers running Windows do not show a blue or black screen unless they are configured to do so.
  Instead these systems suddenly reboot without any notice.

  WhoCrashed shows the drivers that have been crashing your computer with a single click.
  In most cases it can pinpoint the offending drivers that have been causing misery on your computer system in the past.
  It does post-mortem crashdump analysis and presents all gathered information in a comprehensible way.
  In case your system has been crashing because of a hardware failure, WhoCrashed will provide you with guidance to trace the root cause of the problem.

  Normally, debugging skills and a set of debugging tools are required to do post-mortem crash dump analysis.
  Using WhoCrashed you do not need any debugging skills to be able to find out what drivers are causing trouble to your computer.'
