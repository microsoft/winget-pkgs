ShortDescription: Comprehensible crash dump analysis, find out why your system crashed.
Description: |-
  ### WhoCrashed reveals the drivers responsible for crashing your computer

  Whenever a computer running Windows suddenly reboots without displaying any
  notice or blue or black screen of death, the first thing that is often thought
  about is a hardware failure. In reality, crashes are often caused by
  malfunctioning device drivers and kernel modules. In case of a kernel error,
  computers running Windows do not show a blue or black screen unless they are
  configured to do so. Instead these systems suddenly reboot without any notice.

  WhoCrashed shows the drivers that have been crashing your computer with a single
  click. In most cases it can pinpoint the offending drivers that have been
  causing misery on your computer system in the past. It does post-mortem
  crashdump analysis and presents all gathered information in a comprehensible
  way. In case your system has been crashing because of a hardware failure,
  WhoCrashed will provide you with guidance to trace the root cause of the
  problem.

  Normally, debugging skills and a set of debugging tools are required to do
  post-mortem crash dump analysis. Using WhoCrashed you do not need any debugging
  skills to be able to find out what drivers are causing trouble to your computer.
