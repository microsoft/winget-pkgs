ShortDescription: Comprehensible crash dump analysis, find out why your system crashed.
Description: |-
  'WhoCrashed reveals the drivers responsible for crashing your computer

  Whenever a computer running Windows suddenly reboots without displaying any notice or blue or black screen of death, the first thing that is often thought about is a hardware failure.
  In reality, crashes are often caused by malfunctioning device drivers and kernel modules.
  In case of a kernel error, computers running Windows do not show a blue or black screen unless they are configured to do so.
  Instead these systems suddenly reboot without any notice.

  WhoCrashed shows the drivers that have been crashing your computer with a single click.
  In most cases it can pinpoint the offending drivers that have been causing misery on your computer system in the past.
  It does post-mortem crashdump analysis and presents all gathered information in a comprehensible way.
  In case your system has been crashing because of a hardware failure, WhoCrashed will provide you with guidance to trace the root cause of the problem.

  Normally, debugging skills and a set of debugging tools are required to do post-mortem crash dump analysis.
  Using WhoCrashed you do not need any debugging skills to be able to find out what drivers are causing trouble to your computer.'

ReleaseNotes: |-
  'The following changes have been made to WhoCrashed 7.00 since last version

  Support for Windows 11
  • WhoCrashed now supports Windows 11. The program comes along with the latest Windows 11 debug engine.

  Support for latest bugchecks
  • WhoCrashed now supports all latest bugchecks, with proper analysis and descriptions including those which were introduced with Windows 11.

  Significantly improved analysis speed
  • The crash dump analysis process is now significantly faster than before, even if symbol files need to be downmloaded.

  Analysis taking place in a separate thread
  • Analysis now takes place in a separate thread to prevent the message "not responding" from occurring if the user would start clicking while analysis was in progress.

  Command-line options added allowing automation
  • Several command-line options have been added which allow you to run the analyis process automatically and have the results exported to a file.

  Improved analysis algorithms
  • The analysis algorithms used to find the root cause of system crashes have been thoroughly revised and improved. We have tested a long list of bugchecks that we have collected from the wild to make sure the proper analysis details are displayed for every single dump file.

  In-depth analysis for several bugchecks
  • In-depth analysis with special guidance has been added for a number of system crashes.

  Special support for memory corruption bugchecks
  • For crash dumps that are caused by memory corruption, special guidance is provided. An article about the topic has been published on our website as well.

  Option added to analyze a single crash dump file
  • The option to analyze only a single crash dump file has been added.

  New tools menu offers a list of useful tools
  • A new tools menu offers several useful tools at your fingertips which help you maintain and check the health of your system.

  Improved crash dump details
  • The crash dump details tool has been significantly improved. Opening the tool doesn't require the analysis process to be repeated. Also a bug has been fixed which could cause the program to crash with an access violation.

  Improved high DPI support
  • Visibility has been improved for systems with high DPI.

  Bug fixed: support for WinGet
  • A bug has been fixed that prevented the software from getting updated using the WinGet tool. The version number of the program is now properly displayed in the Add/Remove programs applet.

  Bug fixed: memory_corruption and hardware
  • Previous versions could present memory_corruption and hardware as if they were driver files. This has been fixed.

  Bug fixed: driver paths displayed as kernel object paths
  • In previous versions, the full path of driver files could be presented as kernel object paths instead of common user-mode file paths. This has been fixed.

  Bug fixed: local drivers were overwritten
  • In previous versions, the local drivers view would be overwritten with crash dump data. This has been fixed.

  Formatted tables in analysis report
  • The analysis report is now presented with tables which improves readability.

  Improved progress screen with cancel option
  • The screen that is presented during the analysis process now displays a progress bar that is updated frequently during the process. A cancel button has been added to stop the analysis process at any time.

  Analysis time displayed in report
  • The analysis report now displays the time that the analysis process has taken.

  Restore default configaration option added
  • An option has been added to restore WhoCrashed to its default configuration.

  Popup menus added to views
  • Popup menus have been added to most views which allow you to copy selected data to the clipboard.

  Several other changes
  • Several other changes and corrections have been applied to the software which are not being specified.'
