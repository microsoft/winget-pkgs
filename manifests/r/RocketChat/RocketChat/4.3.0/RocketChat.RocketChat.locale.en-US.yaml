  Jitsi Video Calls Opening Inside the App Window Again
  Jitsi video calls now open directly inside the Rocket.Chat Desktop app. Weâ€™ve switched to our default screen picker, also used by other video providers, so the security and permissions flow remains managed by the app.

  - feat: Improve video call window by @jeanfbrito in #3006
  - fix: Error getting uniqueId information from server by @jeanfbrito in #3007
  - feat: Select default browser by @jeanfbrito in #3008
