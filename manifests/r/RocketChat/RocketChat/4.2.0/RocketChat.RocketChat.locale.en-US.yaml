  Jitsi Video Calls Now Opening in Browser
  With our latest update, we've made an important change to how video conferencing works in the Rocket.Chat Desktop application.
  What's changing?
  Starting with this release, all Jitsi video conferences will now open in your default web browser instead of within the Rocket.Chat Desktop app window.
  Why this change?
  Jitsi has recently updated their screen sharing implementation by removing support for the legacy approach we were using in our Desktop app. This change was made as part of their migration to the more modern getDisplayMedia API for screen sharing functionality, as detailed in their recent update.
  Benefits of this change
  - Improved stability and compatibility with Jitsi's latest features
  - Better screen sharing experience through your native browser
  - Full support for all Jitsi functionality without limitations
  What you need to do
  No action is required on your part. When you join a Jitsi video conference, it will automatically open in your default browser rather than within the Rocket.Chat Desktop application.
  If you have any questions or encounter any issues with this change, please don't hesitate to reach out to our support team.
