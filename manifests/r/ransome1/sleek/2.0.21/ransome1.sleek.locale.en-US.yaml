  Contribute
  sleek's backlog is becoming increasingly populated, yet our capacity is limited. If you are skilled in React, TypeScript, Electron, or vitest you can support this project. We need to continue refactoring the code, build reliable test coverage, and reduce bugs. Here you'll find our backlog: https://github.com/users/ransome1/projects/3. For those interested, we've updated our contribution guidelines. The develop branch reflects the most recent progress.
