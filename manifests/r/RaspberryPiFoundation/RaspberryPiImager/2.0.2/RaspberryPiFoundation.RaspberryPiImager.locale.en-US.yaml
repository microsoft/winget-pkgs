  ✨ Features
  Performance
  - Add direct I/O bypass for Linux (O_DIRECT), macOS (F_NOCACHE), and Windows (FILE_FLAG_NO_BUFFERING) to reduce memory pressure during writes
  - Add zero-copy ring buffer for data transfer between download and write threads, reducing CPU overhead
  - Add asynchronous cache file writer to overlap download and disk I/O operations
  - Dynamically adjust write queue depth based on available system memory, tuned for more aggressive performance
  - Add sequential read hints (FADV_SEQUENTIAL, F_RDAHEAD) during verification for better prefetching
  - Track detailed performance metrics for network, decompression, and write phases
  - Use Windows IOCTLs (IOCTL_DISK_DELETE_DRIVE_LAYOUT) for faster disk preparation instead of diskpart
  - Add performance data analysis tool for debugging slow writes (Press CTRL + SHIFT + P, save the JSON, attach to a new Issue).
  Drive Handling
  - Switch drive polling from fixed 1-second interval to adaptive mode (fast during selection, paused during writes)
  - Fix NVMe namespace detection on Linux to correctly identify NVMe drives by parsing /sys/class/nvme/
  - Suppress Windows "Insert a disk" error dialog when accessing empty removable drives
  - Fix macOS APFS volume handling to correctly identify child partitions
  - Allow virtual disks to be treated as 'system' drives on Windows & Linux (macOS was supported from 2.0.0)
  User Interface
  - Add password field component with show/hide toggle button
  - Add type-to-search in combo boxes with backspace support to delete characters
  - Add Enter key to open combo box dropdown when focused
  - Show device and OS names with tooltips when text is truncated
  - Restructure countdown timer before write confirmation dialog can be accepted
  - Fix bottom padding in write confirmation dialog
  - Reintroduce multiple SSH key support
  Accessibility
  - Add proper focus order and keyboard navigation for screen readers across all dialogs
  - Move accessibility description properties to centralized form label component
  macOS
  - Add file type filter popup to native save dialogs (matching Finder behavior)
  - Request location permission asynchronously to avoid blocking the UI when detecting WiFi networks
  - Add dark mode, tinted and clear Liquid Glass icon variants using Icon Composer for proper menu bar appearance
  Linux
  - Fix X11 authorization when running AppImage as root via xhost and proper XAUTHORITY handling
  - Install scalable SVG icon instead of fixed-size PNG for better HiDPI support
  Windows
  - Migrate file dialogs from legacy GetOpenFileName API to modern IFileDialog COM interface
  - Fix file dialog filter string requiring double-null termination
  - Fix scroll direction on ImComboBox
  Customization
  - Allow SSH public key authentication without requiring a username/password to be set
  - Fix missing user creation block when not enabling SSH
  Networking
  - Add automatic fallback from HTTP/2 to HTTP/1.1 after repeated failures
  - Log HTTP protocol version used on successful downloads
  - Skip error dialogs when user cancels download mid-transfer
  - Properly close file handles when operations are cancelled
  Other
  - Add file logging support (--log-file command line argument)
  - Re-use ring buffer memory for SHA256 verification instead of allocating new buffers
  - Validate init_format field in OS list JSON and log warnings for invalid entries
  - Extract clean version string (X.Y.Z) for telemetry instead of full build string
  - Add privilege escalation support for elevatable application bundles
  🐛 Bug Fixes
  - Fix SSH key file dialog filter on Windows (was passing list instead of string)
  - Fix Italian translation inconsistencies
  - Fix icon installation path for Linux desktop integration
  - Fix cloud-init user-data generation for Pi Connect configuration
  - Remove O_SYNC flag from file operations (was causing unnecessary performance penalty)
