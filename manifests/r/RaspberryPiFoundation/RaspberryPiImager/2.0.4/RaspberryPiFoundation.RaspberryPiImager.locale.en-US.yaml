    - Introduce WriteProgressWatchdog to monitor write progress and detect stalls
    - Implement recovery strategies for async I/O including queue depth reduction
      and sync fallback mechanisms
    - Standardize timeout handling for pending writes across all platforms
    - Add 5-minute emergency timeout as fallback for stalled operations
  - Performance:
    - Enhance recovery event handling and monitoring diagnostics
    - Capture SHA256 hash values in performance profiles for verification diagnostics
  - Image Handling:
    - Add support for parsing .gz files to extract uncompressed size information
    - Improve handling for files larger than 4GB
  - Disk Formatting:
    - Fix FAT32 formatting for large drives (>8GB)
    - Improve root directory handling based on sectors per cluster
  - Bug Fixes:
    - Fix external tools (runuser, xdg-open) failing in AppImage due to
      LD_LIBRARY_PATH conflicts causing PAM module loading errors
    - Improve thread safety for download cancellation
    - Enhance error handling for timeout conditions
    - Use Pathlib to generate file:// URIs in local JSON helper script
    - Use XDG-compliant canberra-gtk-play and PipeWire for audio notifications
