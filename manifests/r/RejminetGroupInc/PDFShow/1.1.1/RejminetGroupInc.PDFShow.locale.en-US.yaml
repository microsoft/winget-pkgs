ReleaseNotes: |-
  This release's major increment is the ability to modify, copy/paste, or edit a text annotation. Just double-click on the text and you'll have the ability to operate on the content of the text annotation.
  There are bug fixes to the nav buttons when using Find or the scroll bar.
  The Timer window now takes 1 click to close when done, not two.
