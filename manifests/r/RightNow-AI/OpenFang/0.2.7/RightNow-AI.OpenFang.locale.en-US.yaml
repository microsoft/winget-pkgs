ShortDescription: Open-source Agent Operating System
Description: |-
  OpenFang is an open-source Agent Operating System — not a chatbot framework, not a Python wrapper around an LLM, not a "multi-agent orchestrator." It is a full operating system for autonomous agents, built from scratch in Rust.
  Traditional agent frameworks wait for you to type something. OpenFang runs autonomous agents that work for you — on schedules, 24/7, building knowledge graphs, monitoring targets, generating leads, managing your social media, and reporting results to your dashboard.

  Fixes
  - #174 Fix Unicode byte offset panic in HTML→Markdown conversion — replaced to_lowercase() pattern with ASCII case-insensitive find to prevent panics on multi-byte Unicode (İ, ẞ)
  - #173 Fix dashboard hands status badge — all 4 status variants (Active/Paused/Error/Inactive) now show correct badge colors with action hints
  - #172 Add X-API-Key header support — auth middleware now accepts X-API-Key as fallback alongside Authorization: Bearer
  - #171 Fix hand deactivation orphan agent cleanup — orphaned agents (from failed activations) are now found by hand: tag and killed on deactivate
  - #155 Improve shell_exec error messages — blocked commands now show the current exec_policy mode and how to fix it; shell_exec removed from tool list when mode=Deny
  - #128, #64 Duplicate ClawHub parse errors — already fixed in v0.2.6
