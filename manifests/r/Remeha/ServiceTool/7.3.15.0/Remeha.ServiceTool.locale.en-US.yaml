ShortDescription: PC Servicetool allows for the inspection and management of Remeha boilers and heatpumps as well as long term monitoring of data.
Description: Recom is a software program developed by Remeha B.V. It offers the possibility to communicate directly to Remeha boilers/appliances. The software shows temperatures, fan speed and the status of on/off components like pump and gas-air unit in a clear overview. In Recom , all parameters of the safety unit of the boiler are shown in one overview. Of course you can save settings on a hard drive, so you can always reset to default settings or use a certain setting for multiple boilers in a project.
