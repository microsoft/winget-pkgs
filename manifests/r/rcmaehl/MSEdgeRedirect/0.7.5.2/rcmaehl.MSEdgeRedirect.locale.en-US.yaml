ShortDescription: A Tool to Redirect News, Search, Widgets, Weather and More to Your Default Browser
Description: |-
  This tool filters and passes the command line arguments of Microsoft Edge processes into your default browser instead of hooking into the microsoft-edge: handler, this should provide resiliency against future changes.
  Additionally, an Image File Execution Options mode is available to operate similarly to the Old EdgeDeflector.
  Additional modes are planned for future versions.
