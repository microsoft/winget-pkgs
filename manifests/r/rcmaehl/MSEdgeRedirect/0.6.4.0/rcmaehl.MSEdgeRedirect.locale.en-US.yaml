ShortDescription: A Tool to Redirect News, Search, Widgets, Weather and More to Your Default Browser
Description: 'This tool filters and passes the command line arguments of Microsoft Edge processes into your default browser instead of hooking into the microsoft-edge: handler, this should provide resiliency against future changes. Additionally, an Image File Execution Options mode is available to operate similarly to the Old EdgeDeflector. Additional modes are planned for future versions.'
