  With one system and one data, it solves data sync problems among multiple systems.
  As long as the API documentation is defined, API debugging, API data Mock, API test automation can be used directly without the need to redefine; API documentation shares the same tool with API development and debugging, so once the API debugging is completed, it can be ensured that it is identical to the definition of the API documentation.
