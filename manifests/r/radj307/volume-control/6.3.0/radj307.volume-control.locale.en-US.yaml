ShortDescription: Specific-Application Volume Control Hotkeys for Windows.
ReleaseNotes: |-
  - [#100] Notification position is reset to default instead of the center of the main window.
  - [#101] Added a wrapper around the Main method to catch & log exceptions to STDERR to help with debugging.
  - [#101] Added return codes to Main to help with debugging.
  - Removed the "Override Volume Step" & "Volume Step" action settings and replaced them with a toggleable action setting named "Volume Step Override" (very creative, I know).
  - Added the "Volume Step Override" action setting to the Device: Volume Up/Down & Active Application: Volume Up/Down actions.
  - Added "Target All Sessions" action setting to the Session: Set Volume action.
    When enabled, all sessions are affected.
  - Made the "Volume Level" action setting for the Session: Set Volume action toggleable.
  - Added a toggleable "Mute State" action setting to the Session: Set Volume action.
  - The TextBoxWithCompletionOptions control now commits the current text when you press tab when no options are visible. (This control is used for setting Target Overrides & Hidden Sessions)
  - [SDK] Action settings can now be defined as toggleable so users can enable/disable them without having to implement a custom DataTemplateProvider.
  - [SDK] Renamed namespace VolumeControl.
