ReleaseNotes: |-
  Changed
  - Update to ruby-3.1.7, see release notes.
  - Apply all security patches that Canonical provides for Ubuntu-20.04 because version 1.1.1 is out of maintanence from the OpenSSL project:
    - CVE-2024-2511
    - CVE-2024-4741
    - CVE-2024-5535
    - CVE-2024-9143
    - CVE-2024-13176
  - Fix automatic pacman package install when using bundler-2.5.x. #396
  - Fix pacman install error in parallel bundler install -jX. #403
    pacman invocation is now serialized to avoid locking errors.
  - Update MSYS2 download version to 2024-12-08 for ridk install 1. #402
  - Add junction (directory link) at <ruby>/ssl, which allows to easily find the OpenSSL certificates directory. #399
    The certificates directory varies between ruby versions and the junction unifies the location.
    It is described in <ruby>/ssl/README-SSL.md.
  - Update the SSL CA certificate list.
  - Remove installed gems and MSYS2 by the uninstaller per default. #408
    So far the uninstaller only removed the ruby install files, but kept installed gems and MSYS2.
    The old behaviour is available when running the uninstaller with option /allfiles=no.
    See in the wiki.
    This is to prepare RubyInstaller for the Microsoft Store.
  - Avoid early load of etc.so allowing updates of etc.gem. #388
  - Set a single key in gemrc to allow appending to this file. #388
