ShortDescription: Driver software for ROCCAT products (keyboards, mice, headsets, ...)
Description: Swarm is the driver software designed for many ROCCAT devices and not only bears the proper drivers for Windows, it also enables you to customize your experience in many ways. The software helps to keep your drivers up to date and enables you to restore a device’s firmware should something misbehave at some point. While Swarm is not necessary in order to use ROCCAT devices, it unlocks their full potential. Without Swarm you are still able to use your devices, but you are missing out on features such as illumination controls, re-assigning keys and buttons, customizing sensitivities or creating macros and profiles.
