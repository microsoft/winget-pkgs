ShortDescription: Morphic makes computers easier to use.
Description: |-
  Morphic is a tiny app that makes computers easier to use by:
  - providing a toolbar that makes it easy to discover and use accessibility features built into computers
  - allowing assistive technology (AT) users to use their AT on any computer that has Morphic installed.

  Morphic’s basic features include:
  1. A MorphicBar
     a. that makes it easy to discover the accessibility features built into your computer but buried in the settings panels.
     b. that gives you 1-click access to key features – and a simple menu to access the rest.
  2. The ability to save your accessibility and assistive technology settings securely to the cloud. Then, when using any computer with Morphic on it, you can apply your saved settings so it’s set up just for you. After you’re done, the settings disappear.
