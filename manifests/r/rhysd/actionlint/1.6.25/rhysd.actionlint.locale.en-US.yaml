    Even if the workflow content is passed via stdin, actionlint can recognize reusable workflows depended by the workflow using file path passed at -stdin-filename argument. (#283)

  - Fix go install ./... doesn't work. (#297)
  - Update actionlint pre-commit hook to use Go toolchain.

    For those who don't have Go toolchain, the previous hook is maintained as actionlint-system hook. (#301, thanks @Freed-Wu and @dokempf)
