  Alphas
  - The card table filters have been integrated into the main filter system! You can also now filter by card metadata throughout RemNote.

  - Added a native FSRS scheduler! This is in alpha and we’ll be continuing to polish this up.
    - The main advantages of the native FSRS scheduler are:
      - Works offline
      - Faster
      - Fully works with the exam scheduler
      - We hope to enable weight optimization in the app.
  - Please share feedback in Discord for both - thanks!
