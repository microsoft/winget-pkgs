ReleaseNotes: |-
  New
  You can now add hints to clozes and the front / back of your cards!
  - In a cloze, type (( or /hint to add a hint.
  - On a front-back card, type /front hint or /back hint

  Note - if you find yourself needing to add a hint, there’s a good chance that your card is too complicated and could be split up into multiple simpler cards.

  Exam Scheduler
  - Added mobile notifications for the Exam Scheduler.
  - Improved the "type in answer" card to display what the user actually typed.

  Bugfixes
  - Cleaned up the appearance of super/subscript icons.
  - Fixed the icon in the flashcard menu.
  - Corrected the display of breadcrumbs.
  - Fixed an issue where pasted text using ctrl+shift+v would get removed.
  - Resolved flickering and closing issues with the cloze popup on Android Tablets.
