ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Added builder:setfullyqualified() to force completions to be inserted as fully qualified path names.
  - Completions for <code>clink set <span class="arg">setting_name</span> <span class="arg">input</span></code> use fully qualified path names for <span class="arg">input</span>.  This helps avoid accidentally setting relative paths in global settings; since the current directory changes frequently, setting relative paths usually leads to unintended consequences.
  - Only load a script from a completions\ directory if the associated command exists in the file system.  Also, pass the fully qualified file name as input to the script (in Lua, use ... to get script arguments, e.g. local command = ...).
  - clink info now reports whether Clink is injected.
  - Improve efficiency of updating the input line display.  This eliminates some redundant processing in the Readline library and in Clink.
  - Fixed input line parsing and coloring when the doskey.enhanced setting is off or when doskey macro expansion is suppressed.
  - Fixed line_state:getwordinfo() to accurately set the .alias field when the doskey.enhanced setting is off or when doskey macro expansion is suppressed.
  - Fixed coloring the command word in the command line when queued keys select and accept a command line from history instantly (it could accidentally continue without applying the appropriate coloring).
  - Fixed script error in clink.filematches(nil) and clink.dirmatches(nil); they were meant to behave the same as passing an empty string.
