  Previous Changelog.
  1.30.0: Sliders and Supported Games
  Added TickFrequencyDouble to SliderControlParamsAttribute
  The TickFrequency property on SliderControlParamsAttribute was previously an int, which prevented
  using non-integer tick frequencies for sliders (e.g., 0.5).
  A new TickFrequencyDouble property has been added. When set, it takes precedence over the old TickFrequency property.
  // Old way (integer only, now obsolete)
  [SliderControlParams(minimum: 0, maximum: 1, tickFrequency: 1)]
  // New way (supports non-integer values)
  [SliderControlParams(minimum: 0, maximum: 1, TickFrequencyDouble = 0.1)]
  Alongside the addition of textFieldFormat from @monkeyman192 which (somehow) sat unreleased for 2 years, due to missing Reloaded.Mod.Interfaces release, you can now have sliders with nice fractions in configs, without crazy behaviour.

  A real example where this could be useful could look like this:

  Making the HUD arbitrarily wide on widescreen displays.
  The old TickFrequency property has been marked as [Obsolete] but remains functional for backwards compatibility.
  Warn When Installing Mods Without Supported Games
  When installing mods via drag-and-drop, download, or the r2: protocol, Reloaded-II now checks if the mod
  has any supported applications configured. If none are found, a dialog will prompt you to select which
  game(s) the mod should be enabled for.
  image
  - Selecting Yes opens the mod edit dialog to configure supported applications
  - Selecting No keeps the mod installed without changes (you can configure it later)
  This helps prevent the occasional issue where a mod author forgot to mark a mod as compatible with any game.
  Without an associated game, the mod wouldn't appear in any game's mod list, which could leave users confused.

  Fixes #751.
