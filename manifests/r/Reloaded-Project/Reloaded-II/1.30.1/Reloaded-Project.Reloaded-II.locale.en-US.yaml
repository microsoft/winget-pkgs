  1.30.1: Fixes for French Text and Publishing
  Fix ModConfig.json Regex Inclusion Duplicate Check by @Nenkai
  ModConfig.json is required for all mods, but .json files are otherwise excluded when packaging. Reloaded-II ensures it's included by checking your "Include Regexes" list.
  The duplicate check was broken, causing ModConfig\.json to appear twice in the list if you already had it configured.
  This happened because the check used a StringWrapper type that didn't implement Equals, so it compared object references instead of the actual string values.
  Add French Strings for "Yes/No" Dialog by @dysfunctionalriot
  Adds French localization strings for the mod compatibility warning dialog buttons introduced in 1.30.0.
  1.30.0: Sliders and Supported Games
  Added TickFrequencyDouble to SliderControlParamsAttribute
  The TickFrequency property on SliderControlParamsAttribute was previously an int, which prevented
  using non-integer tick frequencies for sliders (e.g., 0.5).
  A new TickFrequencyDouble property has been added. When set, it takes precedence over the old TickFrequency property.
  // Old way (integer only, now obsolete)
  [SliderControlParams(minimum: 0, maximum: 1, tickFrequency: 1)]
  // New way (supports non-integer values)
  [SliderControlParams(minimum: 0, maximum: 1, TickFrequencyDouble = 0.1)]
  Alongside the addition of textFieldFormat from @monkeyman192 which (somehow) sat unreleased for 2 years, due to missing Reloaded.Mod.Interfaces release, you can now have sliders with nice fractions in configs, without crazy behaviour.

  A real example where this could be useful could look like this:

  Making the HUD arbitrarily wide on widescreen displays.
  The old TickFrequency property has been marked as [Obsolete] but remains functional for backwards compatibility.
  Warn When Installing Mods Without Supported Games
  When installing mods via drag-and-drop, download, or the r2: protocol, Reloaded-II now checks if the mod
  has any supported applications configured. If none are found, a dialog will prompt you to select which
  game(s) the mod should be enabled for.
  image
  - Selecting Yes opens the mod edit dialog to configure supported applications
  - Selecting No keeps the mod installed without changes (you can configure it later)
  This helps prevent the occasional issue where a mod author forgot to mark a mod as compatible with any game.
  Without an associated game, the mod wouldn't appear in any game's mod list, which could leave users confused.
