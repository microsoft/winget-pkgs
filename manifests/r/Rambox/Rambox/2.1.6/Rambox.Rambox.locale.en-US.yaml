  Fixed
  - Occasionally, when clicking on "Add App", the apps' settings drawer opens behind the Apps' list.
  - Menu functions (undo/redo/copy, etc.) not working as expected.
  - Prevent apps from hibernating when they are streaming audio or video.
  - Reposition badges with 2+ digits to fit within tabs, also in Notification Center's indicator.
  - Edit shortcuts not working in macOS (in previous beta).
  - Prevent showing the hibernate leaf in closable tabs (in previous beta)
  - Occasionally, the Focus Mode doesn't deactivate when the Focus Mode timer finishes.
  - When using the double <kbd>Ctrl/Cmd</kbd> shortcut to switch apps, adds a delay to prevent accidental following activations.
  - Link to help article from login section doesn't get opened.
  Improvements
  - Add "Incognito" as a profile option, to have an app that does not store session nor cookies information.
  - Notification center: Set a character limit to prevent notifications with excessive length.
  - Validate Settings.json at startup and if there's something wrong, reset them before continuing.
  - Add the possibility to print or save app content through context menu options.
  - UI improvements to indicate apps' status (disabled and hibernated).
