  New and enhanced features
  - Scheduling privilege and alternative host between linked master/sub accounts - Windows
    Users can add alternative hosts and assign scheduling privileges to other users who are in the same organization, now including users in sub-accounts and the master account. Account owners and admins must link the master/sub account in IM settings to see this account-level setting.
  - Authentication profile enhancement: Domain block-list - Windows
    Configured at the account-, group-, and user-level settings, users authenticated with a specific domain are blocked from joining meetings and webinars hosted by this account.
