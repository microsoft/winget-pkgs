  New and enhanced features
  - Observe privacy settings of calendar events
    When assigning scheduling privileges to other users in Zoom, users can choose if they can manage any meetings that were marked as private in Outlook or Google calendar. If they cannot manage private events, these users cannot see the invite link, meeting topic, or attendee list.
  - Schedule meetings with Focus mode 
    When scheduling a meeting with the Zoom for Outlook plugin, users can enable Focus mode to start automatically when the meeting starts, in order to provide fewer distractions to all meeting participants.

  Resolved issues
  - Minor bug fixes
  - Resolved an issue regarding auto-generated passcodes not honoring minimum passcode requirements.
  - Resolved an issue where the Outlook plugin was stuck in a loading state when scheduling a meeting with more than 50 invitees.
