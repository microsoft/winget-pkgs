ReleaseNotes: |-
  Changes to existing features
  General features
  - Disable and hide Auto-Accept for Remote Control
  A configuration has been added to web settings to provide administrators with the option to disable the user’s ability to select auto-accept for remote control and to hide that feature in the user interface.

  Resolved issues
  General fixes
  - Security enhancements

  - Compatibility change for older plugins and local device selections
  In 5.16.10, a feature was added to save the user’s device selections on the thin client. When connecting to an older plugin, changes have been made to use the previous logic to select the default device.

  - Share session blocked by invisible window
  An issue where users were not seeing the share session has been addressed by adding the ability to find and account for invisible windows owned by other applications. Customers will need to create a registry entry for Zoom to find the application with the invisible window.

  - Correction when moving a window in dual screen mode
  A problem has been fixed for an issue that occurred when dragging or resizing a greenroom video window, CCI video window, a second active video window or a second share window in dual-screen mode, where the window would flash to another screen.

  - Incorrect IP Address displayed for VDI Plugin
  Dashboard reports have been corrected to filter out invalid network IP addresses.

  Linux fixes
  - Network Disconnect and Reconnect Failure
  A problem has been fixed where disconnecting and reconnecting using a LAN cable could fail and the client would exit when reconnecting to the Azure virtual desktop.

  - Missing HID Support for ThinPro7
  A change was made for the Linux Universal installer to correct an issue where the zoommedia_hid.rules file was not installed for ThinPro7.

  VMware fixes
  - Video lost after restarting Horizon with Linux
  An issue for Linux has been corrected where the user started a meeting with video on, restarted Horizon during the meeting and the next meeting had no video.

  - Video alignment incorrect when moving between monitors
  A fix was made to address an issue when resizing and moving windows from one monitor to another could result in the video no longer aligning with the window. The problem could also occur when going in and out of full screen mode.

  Amazon fixes
  - Installation change for AWS PCoIP
  The installer has been modified to skip the installation of the Teradici VChan DLL when installing for Amazon Workspaces using PCoIP to avoid some connectivity issues that could result.
