  Resolved Issues

  General fixes
  - Clean up both old and new log locations for roaming data
  A change for the roaming data location was made in release 6.1.10 to move data from AppData\Roaming to AppData\Local. This release updates logging configuration options to automatically check both locations.

  - Background color missing in Outlook Calendar
  When integrating with the Outlook Calendar, the background color was missing when the current user created a new entry. This issue has been fixed in version 6.2.5 of the standard Windows Zoom Workplace client. The same change has been applied to this patch release for VDI.

  - Potential crash condition for the VDI Zoom Workplace client
  An issue has been fixed where the VDI Zoom Workplace client could terminate when launched. The problem was introduced in release 6.1.12.

  - Frozen share session video
  A problem has been corrected for accounts that enable the new AV1 codec. In some cases a share session could be sent using the AV1 codec to an older VDI Plugin which resulted in the video freezing because the new codec type could not be decoded.

  Windows fixes
  - Virtual Background support for Intel® Core™ 7 processor 150U
  The VDI Plugin has been updated to enable virtual background support for computers with a motherboard based on the Intel® Core™ 7 processor 150U.

  - VDI Plugin Management Auto Update Repair Mode Loop
  An issue has been addressed where a damaged VDI Plugin installation could enter into an endless repair loop.

  - Active Speaker Nametag not updating in Webinar and Events
  A problem has been corrected where the nametag for the active speaker was either not updating or only updating after a long delay when session branding nametags were being used.

  Mac fixes
  - SSL verification update when redirecting to another domain
  A change has been added to handle SSL verifications for MacOS when a download URL redirects to another domain. This change will ensure a future change from Zoom.us to Zoom.com will work with our VDI Plugin Management solution.
