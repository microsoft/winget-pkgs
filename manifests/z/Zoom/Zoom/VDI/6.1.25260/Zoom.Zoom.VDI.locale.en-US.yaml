  General features
  - Zoom Network Connectivity Tool
  Support for the Zoom Connectivity Tool has been expanded with additional coverage for Zoom VDI Users. The Network Connectivity Tool allows users to run a series of tests on their network connection, providing insights into any issues they may be experiencing. Logs can be exported to be provided to Zoom Support for more severe issues and troubleshooting, as well as the ability to run the network test on a specific server URL. For VDI plugins, the option to test applies to only Mac and Windows in this release.

  - Store emoji files in Appdata\local
  To improve performance when using a roaming profile, the emoji files have been moved from AppData\Roaming to Appdata\local

  - Enhanced visual effects and background controls
  Zoom is enhancing the Meetings experience by consolidating visual effect settings, making it easier for users to adjust their video appearance and backgrounds. Now, users can adjust lighting, add background blurs, virtual backgrounds, and more from one place.

  - Multi-share - View newest share tab
  The Multi-Share feature allows participants to share multiple content items and types simultaneously in a meeting. This capability benefits users by organizing each shared item into tabs, making it easier to follow along with the meeting activities. With the latest enhancement to this feature, participants can be directed to the newest share tab so they stay up-to-date with the meeting's flow.

  - Smart Speaker Tag
  When a user joins a meeting that includes a Zoom Room user that has Smart Speaker Tag enabled, the speaker names are displayed in the captions/transcript to indicate which user is speaking.

  Resolved Issues
  General fixes
  - Unable to drag minimized meeting window after CWA 2405 update
  Version 2405 of the Citrix Workspace App required a change to support dragging the minimized meeting window.

  - Mirror my video not displaying correctly in Multi-speaker view
  This release fixes an issue where checking the option “Mirror my video” in Video settings was not correctly sending mirrored video in multi-speaker view.

  - Transparency not displayed when switching to Multi-speaker view
  A problem has been addressed when configuring a meeting to use wallpaper and the option for transparency. The configuration displayed correctly in gallery view but not when switching to multi-speaker view.

  - Bandwidth limits not applied for breakout rooms and greenroom
  An issue where bandwidth limits were not applied when the client was in a breakout room or the backstage/greenroom has been fixed for the standard client and the changes made for the VDI client and plugins as well. The issue has existed since breakout rooms and backstage/greenroom support was added.

  - Display 6 small video participants when in Speaker mode and Maximized or Full Screen
  The number of displayed participants in the video strip above the speaker when in Speaker View is constrained to 6 participants to be both consistent with the standard client and minimize resources required.

  MacOS fixes
  - Omit VDI Plugin Management if newer version is installed
  Previously, if the option to install VDI Plugin Management was checked but a newer version was already installed, the package would display an error message. This has been changed and if a newer release of VDI Plugin Management has been installed, the installer does not attempt to install the older version and does not display an error..

  Azure/Windows 365
  - Unable to start VDI Zoom Meeting client after auto-update
  An issue has been addressed where the VDI Zoom Meeting client was not restarting automatically after an auto-update in a Windows remote desktop environment.

  Linux fixes
  - Add Intel Celeron N5105 to virtual background whitelist
  The Intel Celeron N5105 processor has been added to Zoom’s virtual background whitelist, enabling virtual background support for thin clients using that processor.

  - No scroll button beside the strip videos in immersive view
  An issue was addressed where the scroll button beside the strip videos was not displayed when the number of users displayed in immersive view required an option to scroll.

  Zoom Phone fixes
  - GPS information for 933 calls using the MacOS VDI plugin
  GPS information was missing and has been added for the MacOS VDI Plugin when making a 933 call.

  - Company location cannot be configured for 933 calls
  The option to configure a company location for verification when checking address information through a 933 call was not available when connected to a VDI Plugin. The option has been added in this release.

  - Monitor button and GCP button missing
  A correction was made to display the monitor and GCP buttons after re-opening the virtual machine in client login status.

  ChromeOS
  - Virtual background not displayed in waiting room
  The ChromeOS VDI plugin has been updated to correctly display a virtual background when the user is placed into the waiting room before joining a meeting.

  - Flickering video when dragging the Meeting window
  Changes were made to address video flickering when dragging the meeting window.

  - Minimize and restore a Webinar changes animated emojis display
  A problem has been addressed where minimizing a webinar meeting with animated emojis was changing the displayed emojis to a linear display when the meeting window was restored.

  - Watermark only displayed for participants with video enabled
  When a watermark has been configured, all participants are expected to display the watermark in their participant view. An issue was found and has been fixed where the watermark was not displayed for participants not sending video.
