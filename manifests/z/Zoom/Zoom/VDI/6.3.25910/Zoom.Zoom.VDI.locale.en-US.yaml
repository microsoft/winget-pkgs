ReleaseNotes: |-
  New and enhanced features

  General features
  - VDI Plugin Management version display
  Users can view the installed version of Virtual Desktop Infrastructure Plugin Management in the VDI Statistics tab. If VDI Plugin Management is not installed on the system, "-" will be displayed instead of the version number. This indication helps users quickly determine if they need to install VDI Plugin Management on their virtual desktop.

  - Enhancements to thin client identification for Virtual Desktop Infrastructure reporting
  Administrators can add custom labels to identify managed devices in their Virtual Desktop Infrastructure environment, which can be retrieved via WMI. The labels are included in the device information sent by the Virtual Desktop Infrastructure plugin and displayed in dashboard reports. This enhancement helps distinguish between company-managed devices and personal devices used for remote work (BYOD).

  - Enable Windows Management Instrumentation by default
  Customers running the Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) Zoom Workplace client have Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) enabled automatically. WMI provides status information about the VDI Zoom Workplace client and VDI Plugin to Citrix dashboards.

  - Support for Avaya phone system integration
  Users running Zoom in virtual desktop environments can now register with Avaya phone systems through the VDI plugin. The solution maintains feature parity with the standard Zoom client's Avaya integration, including support for third-party registration and call flows. The VDI implementation automatically inherits configuration options from the desktop client, requiring no additional setup.
  Note: Version 6.3.10 of the plugin is required.

  - Support for video greetings and videomail
  Users in virtual desktop environments can access Zoom Phone's video greeting and videomail features, which were previously only available in the standard Windows client. Users can record custom video greetings and send videomail messages while maintaining the same workflow and experience as non-virtual desktop users.
  Note: This feature is disabled for the Chrome plugin and plugin versions lower than 6.3.10.

  - Support for the “All emojis” option for Webinar reactions
  The VDI client now supports the All emojis selection under the Webinar reactions setting within the Zoom Web portal. Previously, users were only able to view 6 of the available emojis.
  Note: This feature is supported for plugin versions lower than 6.3.10.

  - Removed reboot requirement when using the MSI installer
  Rebooting after installing the VDI client using the MSI installer in Teradici and AWS VM is no longer required after installation.

  - Disabled ability to download plugin versions under 6.2.11 with Omnissa Horizon client
  Users will be unable to use the plugin auto update to upgrade/downgrade to the plugin version below version 6.2.11 when using the Omnissa Horizon client.

  - Support for the ability to move participants from the waiting room directly to breakout rooms
  Hosts and co-hosts using the VDI client can move participants directly from the waiting room to designated breakout rooms without requiring them to enter the main meeting room first.

  Windows features
  - Enhancements to WMI configuration options
  Administrators can use Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to retrieve the opt-out status for Windows and Mac Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) Plugin automatic updates on users' devices. This enhancement expands the WMI capabilities that pull configuration information about computers and the VDI Plugin.

  - The ability to limit downgrading the VDI plugin to admin access only
  By default, the ability to downgrade the VDI plugin is now limited to admin access only. However, admins can use the VDI registry policy AllowDowngrade to allow non-admin users to downgrade the plugin.
  Note: AllowDowngrade can only be added to the local machine.

  Linux features
  - VDI Plugin Management For Linux Platform
  The Zoom VDI Plugin Management application for Linux provides the ability to run VDI Plugin diagnostics. This allows VDI plugins to be checked for any installation issues or other issues with the plugin.

  - Support X11 video render for Linux Platform
  The Zoom VDI client now supports X11 video render, which can greatly reduce the CPU/GPU usage of offloaded video in meetings, especially for AMD CPU with integrated graphics.

  - Optimization for HP T630 and T730
  The VDI client has been optimized for HP T630 and T730 thin clients, improving performance.

  Mac features
  - Support the Repair for Diagnostic tool in VDI Plugin Management
  The Zoom VDI Plugin Management application for Mac provides the ability to run VDI Plugin diagnostics and then use the Repair button to fix some plugin connection issues.

  Resolved issues

  General fixes
  - Improvement on MMRDirect mode
  An enhancement has been made to skip network testing when only MMRDirect mode is configured for the VDI plugin.

  - Nametag being displayed during simulive webinar
  An issue has been addressed where participants' nametags were being displayed during simulive webinars.

  - Mic remains muted when entering recording enabled meeting
  An issue has been addressed where users remain muted when joining a meeting that was being recorded, and they consent to being recorded, even though Mute my mic when joining has been disabled.

  - Lag issues with VDI plugin
  An issue has been addressed where users experienced video lag when using certain versions of the 6.0.12 plugin.

  - Multiple users reporting Zoom crashes during meetings
  Addressed an issue where users experienced the VDI plugin crashing during meetings.

  - Logging tool unable to collect logs
  An issue has been addressed where the logging tool was unable to collect the most recent logs if the log file number was greater than the maximum file amount.

  - Names not being displayed when using Immersive View
   An issue has been resolved where names were not displayed when viewing users in Immersive View.
  Windows fixes

  - Change to remove multiple dump files
  A change was made to the sequence of events that process the collection and removal of log files to ensure the operation to remove a directory was completed before processing the next directory. While the issue always existed, the problem only occurred when a directory contained very small files.

  - Runtime dll missing when launching Zoom Plugin
  Changes have been made to the plugin management to include the runtime dll within the plugin installation

  - Use case-insensitive check for Universal Plugin keyword check
  The Windows Universal Installer has been modified to use a case-insensitive check for existing keywords when installing.
  Chrome Fixes

  - Webview video offset
  Resolved an issue where users were experiencing issues with the webview video being rendered incorrectly and not in the expected position.

  - Remove Pin option not displayed in the correct location
  An issue has been addressed where the Remove Pin option was not displayed in the in-meeting UI's correct location.

  - Video Location Hangs When Window Moves
  Resolved an issue where users were experiencing issues with the popped out video of the speaking user not moving with the main Zoom window after switching to the presenter view.
