  The ability to run tests from within the VDI Zoom Workplace client for Zoom Mesh has been added to the Diagnostics options.

  - System Audio Enhancement control
  A new option labeled “Windows system audio enhancements” added for the standard Zoom Workplace client is also supported for the VDI Zoom Workplace client and new VDI Plugin. Options for “Auto, On and Off” under Audio settings ->Advanced provide users with the ability to follow the system settings for the selected device or enable/disable the feature from within Zoom. Disabling system audio enhancements can be useful to address unwanted noise suppression, such as allowing music to be sent as part of the call.

  - Improvements for “I am away” and “I am back” experience
  Support has been added in the VDI Zoom Workplace client and VDI Plugin for a new improvement added for the standard Zoom Workplace client. When selecting the option to display “I am away”, audio and video are automatically turned off. When changing the indication to show “I am back”, audio and video are restored to their previous state.

  - Broadcast host speaking (mic) from main session to all breakout rooms
  The Breakout Room host can now use a hotkey or UI element to send their microphone audio from the main session to all breakout rooms simultaneously.

  - Allow Users to Turn on Recording without Host
  Meeting hosts now have an administrator setting that can be enabled to allow participants to start recording a meeting without requiring the admin to be present.

  MacOS and Windows Features
  - Diagnostic support for VDI Plugin Management app
  The VDI Plugin Management application optionally installed with the MacOS and Windows VDI plugin has been updated with a diagnostics option.

  Azure/Windows 365 Features
  - Remote Control using Share Offload
  Changes were added in this release for the Azure/Windows 365 platform to support the use of Remote Control when share sessions are redirected to the VDI Plugin (Share Offload). Previously, requests for remote control required disabling Share Offload to provide access to the user’s mouse and keyboard.

  ChromeOS features
  - Support for Pin and Multi-Pin
  The ability to pin one or more participants during a meeting has been added for the ChromeOS VDI Plugin solution.

  Resolved Issues
  - All fixes for previous patch releases 6.1.11, 6.1.12 and 6.1.13 have been incorporated into the 6.2.10 release.

  General fixes
  - Bluetooth HID support
  Improvements have been made for Bluetooth HID devices used with VDI. The improvements add support for using HID controls to accept an incoming call/meeting request and for mute/unmute. Please note that support for ending a meeting or hanging up a call using a HID button is currently not supported for VDI. Leave meeting HID controls are also not supported for USB HID devices.

  - Potential fatal error when waiting room video fails to load
  An issue has been addressed where the waiting room video could fail because of network conditions and clicking “retry” would cause a crash.

  - Profile images may not update dynamically after logging in
  Changes were made in the VDI Plugin to dynamically update the user’s profile image if they join a meeting without logging in and then log in while still in the meeting. The problem affected all previous releases.

  - HID support when running on a physical machine
  For customers that install the VDI Zoom Workplace client on physical machines, a change was made to provide HID support when running Zoom without a remote connection.

  - Concurrent Meeting support
  An issue has been fixed where starting a second meeting would stop the optimization of the first meeting through the VDI Plugin. The problem was traced to a change made in 6.1.12.

  - Share audio not heard when joining breakout room during share session
  A problem has been corrected where a VDI user might not hear the audio from a share session from a host to a breakout room if they joined the breakout room after the share session was started. The problem did not always occur but was determined to be a potential issue since support was added for hosts to share to breakout rooms.

  - Nametag displayed when video is minimized
  The nametag was previously displayed on top of the toolbar when minimizing the video. This release now displays the nametag under the toolbar.

  - Zoom Mail correction for case sensitive check for From address
  A hot fix from the standard client to correct an issue where forwarding an email failed if the From address contained both upper and lower case letters has been added to the VDI release.

  Windows fixes
  - Logi Dock Video Mute not working
  The Logi Dock option to mute video has been fixed for the standard Windows Zoom Workplace client and also confirmed as fixed when using the VDI Zoom Workplace client.

  ChromeOS fixes

  - Incorrect speaker selection used for Zoom Phone
  An issue has been corrected where the wrong speaker could be used for audio during a Zoom Phone call if there were multiple speakers that could be selected. The problem was introduced in 6.1.10.

  Azure/Windows 365 fixes
  - Zoom Workplace Calendar displaying the wrong time
  Changes have been made in both the standard Zoom Workplace app and the VDI Zoom Workspace app to correct for an issue where the API request to get time zone information could fail.

  MacOS fixes
  - VDI Plugin not connecting when using Catalina
  Changes made when creating the MacOS VDI plugin package using a newer release of the packaging software were discovered to introduce a connection issue for any combination of the MaxOS VDI Plugin version 5.17.10 or above and a release of the Mac OS version 10.15.7 or greater. The problem has been corrected in this release and will be provided in a patch release for the previous 6.1.10 branch in the future.
