ReleaseNotes: |-
  New, enhanced, and changed features

  General features
  - Security enhancements

  - VDI supports view sharing in an immersive scene
  For a better user experience, users can now view sharing in an immersive scene. However, when users disable share offload, this feature is unable to work. For ThinPro thin clients, share offload is disabled by default, so they will not support viewing sharing in an immersive scene.

  - Support for Citrix Local App Access
  Customers using Citrix virtual desktops with Local App Access enabled can now use Zoom for basic meeting functionality. This configuration allows Zoom, installed on the remote computer, to run as if it were an application installed on the virtual desktop.

  - Support for Zoom Clips
  Users can now create and share Zoom Clips when using the Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI)  client. This feature enables recording specific application windows within the virtual desktop environment. The recording process happens on the host where the VDI Plugin is installed to ensure the highest possible video quality. This feature is supported for the Windows and macOS plugins.
  Note: Recording a screen share for an application window with Zoom Clips is currently not supported.

  - View public and private IP addresses for the VDI host and plugin
  Administrators can now view the private and public IP addresses for both the VDI client and plugin when hovering over a participant in a meeting or webinar details page, within the Zoom Dashboard.

  - VDI Client auto update waiting time customization
  Users can now customize the Zoom VDI client auto update waiting time via the new policy named SetUpWaitingTimeUpperBoundInSeconds.

  - Enable VDI Plugin auto update by default
  For Windows and macOS VDI plugins, the Zoom VDI Plugin will auto-update if the EnableVDIPluginAutoUpgrade policy is not disabled and if the plugin management version is 6.2.12 or higher.

  - Plugin Management auto update added
  For Windows and macOS plugins, starting the Zoom VDI Plugin Management App will trigger the plugin management to auto-update  to the latest version.

  - VDI status indicator added
  Users can verify if their VDI client is connected to the plugin by a new status indicator at the top left of the client and the meeting client:
  Grey if the plugin is not connected.
  Yellow if the plugin is connecting.
  Green if the plugin is connected.
  Clicking the status indicator will open settings to the statistics VDI page.

  - Enhancements to WMI configuration options
  Administrators can use Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to retrieve the plugin CPU and GPU information. This enhancement expands the WMI capabilities that pull configuration information about computers and the VDI Plugin.

  - Disable download  ASR models to device (closed caption)
  The ability to download ASR models locally to the VDI client has been disabled.

  - Low bitrate audio codec for phone
  Support has been added for switching to a low-bitrate codec in low-bandwidth scenarios.

  Windows
  - Support for ARM64 with the VDI plugin
  Added support for the ARM64 version of the Windows App on ARM-based Windows systems. This allows the Zoom VDI plugin to support both x64 and ARM64 versions of the Windows App on these platforms. This enables native ARM64 application support for the Windows Remote Desktop application, Azure Virtual Desktop, and other similar services.

  - User Interface removed from Zoom VDI Universal Plugin (Windows)
  The Zoom VDI Universal Plugin user interface has been removed from the Windows plugin. Users can instead use the command line to customize plugin options.
  Resolved issues

  General fixes
  - Unable to view screen share when using the VDI plugin
  An issue has been addressed where users are unable to view screen shares due to the VDI client not passing screen share content to the plugin.

  Windows fixes
  - Slow response with Zoom Contact Center
  An issue has been addressed where Zoom Contact Center would become unresponsive when more than one chat is open.

  - VDI client not recognizing uniquedatadir
  An issue has been addressed where the VDI Client would create a default "data" folder instead of a unique folder name when the uniquedatadir feature was enabled, due to MAC address retrieval failing on systems with NetBIOS disabled.

  - ForceSilentVDIPluginUpdate is not being recognized by the VDI client
  An issue has been addressed where the ForceSilentVDIPluginUpdate is not recognized by the VDI client when manually added to the host’s registry, or when deployed via Zoom Device Management (ZDM).

  macOS fixes
  - Zoom meeting and chat links launching Zoom VDI plugin management
  An issue has been addressed where, when the 6.4.10 VDI plugin management is installed, users clicking on Zoom meeting or chat links launch the Zoom Plugin Management Diagnostic tool instead.

  - Zoom VDI plugin auto-upgrade failing on Omnissa 8.15.0
  An issue has been addressed where the Zoom VDI plugin failed to auto-update or auto-downgrade on Omnissa 8.15.0.

  Linux fixes
  - HID devices not synchronizing with VDI client
  An issue has been addressed where devices utilizing the HID protocol were not syncing with the VDI client on Linux hosts utilizing PipeWire.

  - Blurred screen share content
  An issue has been addressed where screen share content was blurred after selecting the Fit to Window option.
