  General Features
  - Save Screenshots as Files and in Clipboard

  The setting on the thin client for Opt Out has been added to the WMI class for PluginInfo.

  - Policy to disable an MS Teams check related to HID
  A new policy named CheckHIDControl has been added. Adding the policy and setting the value to FALSE  will disable the check for the msteams.exe process.

  Resolved Issues
  General fixes
  - Limit the number of Custom Filter Files created by custom apps
  Zoom Apps that create custom filters are now limited to only ten filters before older filters are overwritten. This change is to avoid excessive filters from being created for updates such as displaying the current time. This issue addresses a change made in release 6.2.10.

  - Fix from standard Windows client to address unresponsive session
  An issue initially reported for the standard Zoom Workplace client was fixed in release 6.3.0. The same problem was found to also affect the VDI Zoom Workplace client and could result in multiple users temporarily freezing during a Zoom meeting.

  Zoom for Workplace VDI client crashing during meetings
  An issue has been fixed with the video codec, causing the Zoom for Workplace VDI client to crash during meetings.

  Windows fixes
  - Use case insensitive check for Universal Plugin keyword check
  The Windows Universal Installer has been modified to use a case insensitive check for existing keywords when installing.

  - Change to remove multiple dump files
  A change was made for the sequence of events that process the collection and removal of log files to ensure the operation to remove a directory was completed before processing the next directory. While the issue always existed, the problem only occurred when a directory contained very small files.

  - Runtime dll missing when launching Zoom Plugin
  Changes have been made to the plugin management to include the runtime dll within the plugin installation.

  - AI Companion setting not being followed
  An issue has been fixed with the Allow users to ask AI Companion questions about the meeting, sub-setting Share Access with not being recognized when in a meeting.

  - Skip DLL signature check for APP-V deployment
  Changes have been made when installing the Zoom for Workplace VDI client, signature checks for dll files loaded from App-V will no longer be necessary.

  - Roaming file size keeps increasing with corrupted DB file
  An issue has been fixed with the corrupted DB files, causing the roaming profile folder for the Zoom for Workplace VDI client to become excessively large.
