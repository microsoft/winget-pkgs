  Resolved Issues
  General fixes
  - Use Separate Audio Device for Ringtone
  A fix was made to play the ringtone on the selected device for the option "Use separate audio device to play ringtone simultaneously". The problem resulted from optimization done in 6.0.10.

  - Client freezing when joining meetings with many participants
  This VDI release includes changes found and fixed for the standard Zoom Workplace client related to joining a meeting from Zoom Calendar with a large number of participants in the invite.

  Windows fixes
  - Unable to drag minimized meeting window after CWA 2405 update
  Version 2405 of the Citrix Workspace App required a change to support dragging the minimized meeting window.

  Linux fixes
  - Mouse click not captured after text annotation using iGel and VMware
  If text annotation was used during a share session, a problem was discovered where mouse clicks on target areas such as a menu were not being processed. The issue was found in 6.0.11 when using an iGel plugin in a VMware environment.

  - High CPU load with 2k/4k monitors with HP T630/T740
  To address increased CPU load that affects meeting performance when high resolution monitors are connected to HP T630 and T740 thin clients, video resolution and frame rate are now reduced.

  Zoom Phone fixes
