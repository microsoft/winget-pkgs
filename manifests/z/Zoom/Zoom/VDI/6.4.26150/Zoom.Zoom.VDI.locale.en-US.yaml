  General features
  - Connectivity Tool for VDI
  Users can run diagnostic tests to check connectivity status from both their virtual desktop and the Virtual Desktop Infrastructure plugin installed on their thin client. The tool displays comprehensive test results from both environments in a unified interface, following the existing layout with an additional section dedicated to plugin results. This enhancement helps Linux Virtual Desktop Infrastructure users troubleshoot connection issues more effectively by providing visibility into both client and plugin connectivity status.

  - Update to OpenSSL 3.3.3
  Due to the recently disclosed vulnerabilities with lower versions of OpenSSL, the Zoom client is updated to use OpenSSL 3.3.3. Depending on your network security configuration, you may also need to update your network infrastructure devices' firmware.

  - Contact limit increased to 3000
  The personal contact limit has been increased from 1000 to 3000 contacts.

  - Support PSI Mitel for VDI phone
  Support media offload capabilities and emergency calling for the Zoom-Pitel MSI integration.

  - Support for joining guest Zoom Mesh networks
  The VDI client now supports the Zoom Mesh guest feature. Administrators can configure the VDI client with the EnableGuestMesh GPO policy, allowing the users to join external mesh networks.

  - Ability to select the only option “Later”: when prompted to update by VDI plugin auto-update feature.
  “OK” is disabled, and "Later" is the only option for users when prompted to update the plugin by the auto-update feature. It will wait until the user disconnects from their virtual desktop(s) and then performs the VDI plugin update.

  - Diagnostic tool support for memlog export
  The diagnostic tool supports exporting memory logs, which contain memory logs from the VDI client and VDI plugin, as well as a process list log.
