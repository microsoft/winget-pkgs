ShortDescription: decentralized cross-platform software installation system
Description: Zero Install is a decentralized cross-platform software installation system available under the LGPL. It allows software developers to publish programs directly from their own web-sites, while supporting features familiar from centralised distribution repositories such as shared libraries, automatic updates and digital signatures. It is intended to complement, rather than replace, the operating system's package management.
