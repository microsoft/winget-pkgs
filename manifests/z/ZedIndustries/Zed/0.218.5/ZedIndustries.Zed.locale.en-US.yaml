ShortDescription: High-performance, multiplayer code editor from the creators of Atom and Tree-sitter.
Description: |-
  Zed is a next-generation code editor designed for high-performance collaboration with humans and AI.
  - Written from scratch in Rust to efficiently leverage multiple CPU cores and your GPU.
  - Integrate upcoming LLMs into your workflow to generate, transform, and analyze code.
  - Chat with teammates, write notes together, and share your screen and project. All included.
  - Zed now speaks WSL. You can open a Linux distro as a first-class “remote” target, edit projects that live inside it.
  - All of Zed’s AI features, including edit predictions and ACP-powered agents, are fully supported on Windows.
  - All Zed extensions now work seamlessly on Windows; no special steps, no caveats.
  - To run on almost all Windows versions, including VMs, we created a new rendering backend based on DirectX 11.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  This week's release includes initial support for Dev Containers, a new worktree trust mechanism, a new Tree view for the Git panel, SQL syntax highlighting in Python files, AI-generated commit messages that respect rules files (e.g. AGENTS.md), improved terminal scrolling and link detection, and a set of Helix mode keymap improvements.
  Features
  AI
  - Agent: Added save_file and restore_file_from_disk agent tools to handle dirty buffers when editing files. (#45005)

  Other

  - Introduced worktree trust mechanism, can be turned off with "session": { "session": { "trust_all_worktrees": true }}.
    - Read the Secure by Default blog post.
  - Improved link parsing for cases when a link is embedded in parentheses, e.g. Markdown. (#44733; thanks KyleBarton)

  - Suppressed warnings for trailing commas in built-in JSON files (settings.json, keymap.json, etc.). (#43854; thanks ian-h-chamberlain)
  - Added a new value to the restore_on_startup setting called launchpad. This value makes Zed open with a variant of the welcome screen ("the launchpad") upon startup. Additionally, this same page variant is now also what is displayed if you close all tabs in an existing window that doesn't contain any folders open. The launchpad page shows you up to 5 recent projects, making it easy to open something you were working on recently. (#44048; thanks simonpham)
  Bug Fixes
  - Windows: Fixed the folder picker inserting wrong slashes when remoting from Windows to WSL. (#44886)
  - Windows: Fixed terminal hyperlinking not working for file:// schemes with Windows drive letters. (#44847)
  - Windows: Fixed double hover state. (#44711)
  - Windows: Fixed SendKeystrokes mapping. (#44707)

  - Git: Fixed a bug where not all branches were being shown in the branch selector when the search field was empty. (#44742)

  - Fixed a case where an incorrect match could be generated in label_for_completion. (#44925; thanks Nereuxofficial)
  - Fixed an issue where Markdown tables would sometimes show double borders. (#44991)

  - Fixed quote autoclose incorrectly counting quotes inside strings. (#44281; thanks errmayank)

  - Fixed a bug where double- and triple-click selection would not correctly expand by word and by line within Markdown elements (diagnostics, agent panel, etc.), instead requiring manual adjustment. (#43813; thanks RMcGhee)
