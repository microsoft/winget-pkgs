ShortDescription: High-performance, multiplayer code editor from the creators of Atom and Tree-sitter.
Description: |-
  Zed is a next-generation code editor designed for high-performance collaboration with humans and AI.
  - Written from scratch in Rust to efficiently leverage multiple CPU cores and your GPU.
  - Integrate upcoming LLMs into your workflow to generate, transform, and analyze code.
  - Chat with teammates, write notes together, and share your screen and project. All included.
  - Zed now speaks WSL. You can open a Linux distro as a first-class “remote” target, edit projects that live inside it.
  - All of Zed’s AI features, including edit predictions and ACP-powered agents, are fully supported on Windows.
  - All Zed extensions now work seamlessly on Windows; no special steps, no caveats.
  - To run on almost all Windows versions, including VMs, we created a new rendering backend based on DirectX 11.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  This week's release includes most of December's quality week items and is packed!
  Highlights include subpixel (ClearType-style) text rendering on Windows and Linux to improve text clarity on standard DPI displays, the ability to favorite/pin Agent models, cycle them via alt-tab, and queue messages in the agent panel, a git: create pull request command, UI controls to restart/stop individual language servers, a which-key-like modal (enable with {"which_key": {"enabled": true}}), improved Markdown list editing via extend_list_on_newline and indent_list_on_tab, many performance boosts — and much much more!
  Features
  AI
  - Agent: Added the ability to mark language models as favorites and pin them to the top of the list. This feature is available in the native Zed agent (including text threads and the inline assistant), and in external agents. (#44297, #45528; thanks aqrln)
  - Agent: Added the ability to cycle through favorited models using the alt-tab keybinding. (#45032)

  - Agent: Added the ability to configure timeouts for context server tool calls. The new global context_server_timeout setting controls the default timeout (default is 60s, max: 10min).
