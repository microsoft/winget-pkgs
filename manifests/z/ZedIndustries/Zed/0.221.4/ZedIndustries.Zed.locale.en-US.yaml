ShortDescription: High-performance, multiplayer code editor from the creators of Atom and Tree-sitter.
Description: |-
  Zed is a next-generation code editor designed for high-performance collaboration with humans and AI.
  - Written from scratch in Rust to efficiently leverage multiple CPU cores and your GPU.
  - Integrate upcoming LLMs into your workflow to generate, transform, and analyze code.
  - Chat with teammates, write notes together, and share your screen and project. All included.
  - Zed now speaks WSL. You can open a Linux distro as a first-class “remote” target, edit projects that live inside it.
  - All of Zed’s AI features, including edit predictions and ACP-powered agents, are fully supported on Windows.
  - All Zed extensions now work seamlessly on Windows; no special steps, no caveats.
  - To run on almost all Windows versions, including VMs, we created a new rendering backend based on DirectX 11.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  This week's release includes support for installing agents through the new ACP Registry, Agent message queuing as the default behavior (with the ability to edit and interrupt queued messages), per-tool permissions when confirming agent tool use, MCP server support for remote development, Vim-style tag stack navigation for "Go to Definition" jumps, EditorConfig inheritance from parent directories, and improved Dev Container support including Podman.
  Features
  AI
  - Agent: Added the ability to install new Agents via the ACP Registry. (#47470)
  - Agent: Added the ability to edit queued messages. (#47234)
  - Agent: Added a menu item in the agent panel right-click menu for copying a given agent's response. (#46529; thanks DepsCian)
  - Agent: Added @diagnostics to "New Thread" conversations so you can feed current language-server diagnostics directly into the Agent Panel context. This keeps parity with text threads while staying within the cursor-aware assistant workflow. (#42270; thanks GoldStrikeArch)
  - Agent: Made it easier to interrupt the agent while having messages in the queue. (#46954)
  - Agent: Made queuing prompts the default behavior when sending them while there's an on-going generation. (#46797)
  - Agent: Added reasoning content support for the OpenAI provider. (#43662; thanks aeroxy)
  - Agent: Changed the display of tokens for OpenAI models to reflect the input/output limits. (#46829)
  - Agent: Changed the behavior of queued messages to gracefully wait for the current activity to complete. (#46980)
  - Agent: Improved streaming tool call performance by batching UI updates. (#46802)
  - Agent: Added support for running MCP servers on the remote server when using remote development. This can be enabled by setting the "remote": true property in the settings entry for the MCP server. (#46756)
  - Agent: Added the ability to set per-tool permissions when confirming/denying tool use. (#46284)
  Languages
  - Markdown: Improved bracket colorization. (#47026)
  - Python/Ty: Added support for using venv-installed ty binary. (#47029)
  Vim / Helix
  - Added Vim-style tag stack navigation. "Go to Definition" jumps are now tracked in a dedicated stack, so you can navigate back through them without wading through your full navigation history. Use the new pane: go to older tag and pane: go to newer tag commands. (#46002; thanks zenazn)
  Remote Development
  - Changed opening bundled files, keymap, local release notes and the log file view to open in remote windows instead of opening a new local Zed window. (#46910)
  - Changed opening the settings files, keymap files, task files and debug files to open within WSL windows instead of opening a new local Zed window. (#46910)
  Other
  - Improved Dev Container support (#47021; thanks KyleBarton):
    - Added modal to initialize a dev container definition in the project with projects: initialize dev container.
    - Added Podman support for dev container actions with the use_podman setting.
    - Improved devcontainer error handling.
  - Workspace: Added the list of recent projects to the multi-project title bar menu. (#46828)
  - Added the language server's path to a tooltip that is shown when hovering on its status in the language server menu. (#47037)
  - Added support for .editorconfig files outside the project directory. Zed now traverses parent directories to find and apply EditorConfig settings. Use root = true in any .editorconfig to stop inheriting settings from parent directories. (#46332)
  - Settings UI: Added support for viewing and updating project settings files in remote projects. (#45292)
  - Improved pane::CloseActiveItem to close center pane items even when focus is on a dock panel like the project panel or outline panel. (#46421; thanks FloppyDisco)
  Bug Fixes
  - ACP: Fixed env vars not being properly applied to built-in ACP agents. (#46946)
  - Agent: Fixed a bug with the message queue in the agent panel where @-mentions weren't being displayed in the message preview within the queue entries list. (#46964)
  - Agent: Fixed terminal command truncation in the agent panel to better expose long commands (e.g., potentially dangerous multi-line commands are now fully visible before execution). (#40570; thanks miguelcsx)
  - Agent: Fixed Anthropic models not appearing in the Copilot Chat model picker. (#47591)
  - Debugger: Fixed a crash that occurred when splitting a pane by dragging a pane item that originated from that pane. (#46806; thanks xcb3d)
  - Terminal: Fixed vi mode cursor not visually updating when navigating with vi motion keys. (#46762; thanks xcb3d)
  - Fixed "Add Folder to Project" and "Remove from Project" menu items being incorrectly hidden on remote projects. (#47283)
  - Fixed editor::AddSelectionAbove and editor::AddSelectionBelow when skipping over soft-wrapped lines to preserve the original cursor column when adding selections through lines shorter than the starting position. (#46911)
  - Fixed a bug with very wide tables not being fully visible in markdown previews. (#46834)
  - Fixed agent model selector cutting off models at the end of the list. (#47263)
  - Fixed an issue where a few file descriptors would be leaked each time a project was closed. (#47246)
  - Fixed an issue where rebuilding a dev extension would compile the extension in release and not debug mode. (#47165)
  - Fixed context menus dismissing/canceling when the window loses focus. (#46866; thanks notnotjake)
  - Fixed incorrect rendering of characters at large font sizes on macOS. (#45957; thanks JonyLab)
  - Fixed issue where markdown tables rendered within lists would overlap items above/below it. (#46783)
  - Fixed json-language-server not considering file_types from project settings. (#46991)
  - Fixed onboarding page saving the selected theme based on the system appearance and not the currently selected one. (#47245; thanks HackAttack)
  - Fixed poetry environment not discovered on Linux. (#47100; thanks lingyaochu)
  - Fixed project search include/exclude filters not working correctly in remote project with multiple folders. (#47280)
  - Fixed remote connections getting stuck in limbo when the server side dies unexpectedly. (#47200)
  - Fixed screen sharing performance on Windows and Linux. (#46986)
  - Fixed terminal cyan color displaying as green in One Light theme. (#45691; thanks MateoKruk)
  - Fixed trackpad scrolling being too fast in terminal applications with mouse mode enabled (tmux, Neovim, opencode, etc.). (#45600; thanks emamulandalib)
  - Fixed "Format Selection" not working when editing files over SSH remote connections. (#47194)
  - Fixed AI commit message button in Git panel being hidden instead of disabled when no AI provider is configured. The button now remains visible with a tooltip explaining how to enable the feature. (#46525; thanks ivan-magda)
  - Fixed language injections sticking after language comment removed. (#47790)
  - Fixed mistyping the SSH password in the askpass prompt on Windows locking you out of retyping the correct one. (#47760)
  - Fixed excessive disk space usage from the hang_traces directory. (#47693)
  - Fixed a bug where terminal tasks failed to start on Windows when using cmd.exe. (#47627)
