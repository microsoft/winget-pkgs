ShortDescription: High-performance, multiplayer code editor from the creators of Atom and Tree-sitter.
Description: |-
  Zed is a next-generation code editor designed for high-performance collaboration with humans and AI.

  - Written from scratch in Rust to efficiently leverage multiple CPU cores and your GPU.
  - Integrate upcoming LLMs into your workflow to generate, transform, and analyze code.
  - Chat with teammates, write notes together, and share your screen and project. All included.
  - Zed now speaks WSL. You can open a Linux distro as a first-class “remote” target, edit projects that live inside it.
  - All of Zed’s AI features, including edit predictions and ACP-powered agents, are fully supported on Windows.
  - All Zed extensions now work seamlessly on Windows; no special steps, no caveats.
  - To run on almost all Windows versions, including VMs, we created a new rendering backend based on DirectX 11.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  This week's release brings rainbow brackets 🌈 (addressing a feature-request with 1080 👍s), support for OpenAI's GPT 5.1 model for BYOK users, and further performance improvements to project search.
  Features
  AI
  - Added support for OpenAI's GPT 5.1 model to BYOK. (#43492)
  - Agent: Added the ability to set a model as the default for a given built-in external agent (Claude Code, Codex CLI, or Gemini CLI). (#43122)
  - Agent: Added support for specifying settings for ACP extensions (default_mode, default_model). (#43177)
  - Agent: Improved the "reject"/"keep" behavior when regenerating older prompts by auto-keeping pending edits that don't originate from the prompt to-be-regenerated. (#43347)
  - Agent: Made the thread markdown editable. (#43377)
  Git
  - ⭐Improved readability of files in the git changes panel. (#41857; thanks alphathekiwi)
  - ⭐Compressed large diffs for commit message generation. (#42835; thanks 11happy)
  - ⭐Fixed git not preserving file mode when committing. Executable files now retain their permissions when committed with Zed. (#41900; thanks 11happy)
  - ⭐Fixed highlighting for addition and deletion for diff language. (#38384; thanks tidefield)
  - Fixed displaying auto-commit suggestions for single staged entries. (#43470)
  Debugger
  - Added $ZED_PICK_PID variable for debug configurations, allowing users to select which process to attach the debugger to at runtime. (#42913)
  Languages
  - Python: Added support for detecting uv workspaces as toolchains. (#43496)
  - C++: Added support for treating .h++ files as C++. (#42802; thanks bnjmnjrk)

  - Windows: Fixed maximized window size when DPI scale changes. (#40053; thanks cppcoffee)
  - Linux: Fixed window control buttons not showing in GNOME Wayland when SSD requested. (#39313; thanks Be-ing)
  - Linux: Fixed ./script/install-Linux for installing a development version of Zed on Linux. (#43205)
  - Agent: Fixed an issue where ACP agents would start MCP servers that were disabled in Zed. (#43467)
  - Agent: Fixed AI assistant edits being scrambled when file was modified while it was open. (#43103)
  - Terminal: Fixed a bug where search match highlights wouldn't update their position when resizing the terminal. (#43507)
  - Terminal: Fixed terminal path hyperlinks for paths containing unicode punctuation and emoji, e.g. mojo.🔥. (#40305; thanks davewa)
  - Terminal: Fixed path hyperlinks for Windows verbatim paths, for example, \\?\C:\Over\here.rs. (#40305; thanks davewa)
  - Vim: Fixed bug where pressing d . . would freeze the editor. (#42145; thanks AidanV)
  - Vim: Fixed the cursor shape reset in vim mode deactivation, ensuring that the user's cursor_shape setting is used. (#42834; thanks lennartkloock)
  - Vim: Fixed paste not working correctly in vim visual modes. (#43031; thanks adriandlam)
  - Helix: Fixed bug where Vim::NextWordEnd in HelixSelect would not select whole word. (#43234; thanks AidanV)
  - Helix: Fixed a bug where <g-l> in Helix mode would not move the cursor to the last character of the line. (#41575; thanks HuaGu-Dragon)
  - Debugger: Fixed input elements within the launch tab in the new session modal to be keyboard navigable. (#43344)

  - Fixed an issue in the settings UI where changing the terminal shell would set the default shell to sh on Windows. (#43276)
  - Fixed a small issue where a scrollbar would sometimes show in the editor although the content fit exactly on screen. (#43548)
  - Fixed an unnecessary error being logged on startup when SWEEP_AI_TOKEN environment variable is not set. (#43504; thanks oscarvarto)
  - Fixed an issue where accepting a completion for a semver version in package.json would append the suggestion to the existing text instead of replacing it. (#43473)
  - Fixed displaying auto-commit suggestions for single staged entries. (#43470)
  - Fixed a bug where expanding excerpts would fail when the cursor was at the excerpt start. (#42324; thanks olejorgenb)
  - Fixed the following three editor actions not working in remote environments. (#43362; thanks errmayank)
    - editor: copy file name
    - editor: copy file location
    - editor: copy file name without extension
  - Fixed a bug where language server info was not available in remote projects. (#42831; thanks errmayank)
  - Fixed shell env sourcing not working with powershell on unix systems. (#43390)
  - Fixed editor tab tooltips not showing file path for remote files. (#43359; thanks errmayank)
  - Fixed a bug where invalid values in settings files would prevent the rest of the file from being parsed. (#42938)
  - Fixed a bug where a sent agent message would be lost after successful authentication. (#43245)
  - Fixed connect.host setting being ignored by debugpy. (#43190)
  - Fixed a bug where multi-stroke keybindings (like cmd-k cmd-s, or g d in vim mode) would time out waiting for input. Previously, Zed would wait at most 1s for the second keystroke before timing out. In cases where the start of the multi-stroke binding is itself a valid key action (or input text), the 1s timeout still applies. (#42659; thanks xipeng-jin)
  - Fixed issue with popups and menus not being dismissed while using auto_signature_help in Helix Mode. (#43169)
  - Fixed a panic when using vim increment on a multibyte character. (#43101)
  - Fixed an issue where the padding on info popovers would overlay text when the content was scrollable. (#43107)
  - Fixed LSP status list containing zombie entries for LSPs in other windows. (#42733)
  - Fixed encoding error in terms & conditions displayed when installing. (#42906)
  - Fixed ligatures forming between different text kinds. (#43080)
  Breaking Changes and Notices
  - Linux: Added window_decorations setting to control whether Zed or the compositor draws window decorations. This replaces the undocumented ZED_WINDOW_DECORATIONS environment variable, which still works but is deprecated. Set to "server" for system titlebars or "client" (default) for Zed's custom titlebar. Requires restart. (#39250; thanks Be-ing)
  - Removed the default cmd-opt-. binding for toggling hidden files in the Project Panel so it's harder to hide them by accident. (#43091)
