ShortDescription: High-performance, multiplayer code editor from the creators of Atom and Tree-sitter.
Description: |-
  Zed is a next-generation code editor designed for high-performance collaboration with humans and AI.

  - Written from scratch in Rust to efficiently leverage multiple CPU cores and your GPU.
  - Integrate upcoming LLMs into your workflow to generate, transform, and analyze code.
  - Chat with teammates, write notes together, and share your screen and project. All included.
  - Zed now speaks WSL. You can open a Linux distro as a first-class “remote” target, edit projects that live inside it.
  - All of Zed’s AI features, including edit predictions and ACP-powered agents, are fully supported on Windows.
  - All Zed extensions now work seamlessly on Windows; no special steps, no caveats.
  - To run on almost all Windows versions, including VMs, we created a new rendering backend based on DirectX 11.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  This week's release includes support for self-hosted OpenAI-compatible servers for edit predictions, a new Review Branch button in the git branch diff view for sending diffs to an agent for review, diagnostic count badges in the project panel, and the ability to undo the reject all action when reviewing agent-made changes.
  Features
  AI
  - Added the ability to use a self-hosted OpenAI-compatible server for edit predictions. (#49554)
  - Agent: Added the ability to undo the reject all action from agent-made changes. (#48462)
  - Agent: Added support for Claude Sonnet 4.6 for Bedrock. (#49439; thanks 5herlocked)
  - Agent: Added fallback error handling for connect failures. (#50063)
  - Agent: Changed agent::addSelectionToThread (cmd->) to use the current line of the cursor when there is no selection. (#48045; thanks notpeter)
  Git
  - Added diff stat numbers to the git branch diff (git: branch diff) view. (#49716)
  - Added a Review Branch button in the git: branch diff view so that the whole diff can be quickly sent for review to an agent. (#49513)
  - Improved split diff performance by reducing number of entity clones for very large pre-loaded multibuffers. (#49573)
  Languages
  - Improved completion order for Python-based LSPs. (#47160; thanks lingyaochu)
  - Added syntax highlighting for HTML character references (&middot;, &apos;, &#123;, etc.) in TSX, JavaScript, and HTML files. (#48629; thanks br-schneider)
  - Go: Added definition highlights for functions, methods, and types. (#49120; thanks tvi)
  - Markdown: Added .mdc as a recognized file extension. (#50074; thanks avifenesh)
  REPL
  - Added WSL and SSH remote kernels and wired up spawn/kill kernel proto messages and client requests. (#47891; thanks MostlyKIGuess)
  - Added ability to clear outputs by action. (#49631; thanks rgbkrk)
  - Added basic handling of HTML in REPL outputs. (#49646; thanks rgbkrk)
  Windows
  - Added a zed: record etw profile action that can be used to collect performance profiles. (#49712)
  Other

  - Reduced memory usage on macOS. (#49236; thanks marcocondrache)
  - Optimized performance for language servers which register many file-watching notifications. (#49778)
  - Improved the checkerboard pattern in the image viewer to be more visually pleasant. (#49575; thanks MostlyKIGuess)
  - Added diagnostic count badges to the project panel, displaying error and warning counts next to file names. You can modify this setting using the diagnostic_badges option, which is enabled by default. (#49802; thanks Obli04)
  - Added copy button for project diagnostics messages. (#49671; thanks ozacod)
  - Improved multi-cursor paste to distribute each clipboard line to its corresponding cursor when the line count matches. (#48676)
  - Added debug_panel::Toggle to show/hide debug panel like terminal_panel::Toggle. (#48020; thanks samueldominguez)
  - Added workspace::ActivateLastPane action for keybindings that focus the last pane. (#49853; thanks gh-xj)
  - Improved the zed: open performance profiler action to display profiling data from the remote server. (#49582)
  Bug Fixes
  - Agent: Fixed the OpenAI-compatible setting description to point to the server's completion API URL. (#49846; thanks Marcuss2)
  - Agent: Fixed the agent edit tool clearing file contents before the first edit arrives, which caused buffers to appear empty for prolonged periods with slow agents. (#49633)
  - Agent: Fixed Codex ACP installation robustness by staging downloads. (#45428; thanks cppcoffee)
  - Agent: Fixed Anthropic streaming for alternative providers by accepting SSE data:{...} (no space) lines. (#47847; thanks raphaelluethy)

  - Debugger: Fixed a bug where active debug lines could be set in the wrong pane. (#49390)
  - Git: Fixed a bug where the buttons to toggle the split diff view would have no effect when the diff being viewed was empty. (#49884)
  - Git: Fixed pull request link detection picking up unrelated links in git output. (#49817; thanks kbidlack)
  - Linux: Fixed crashes that could happen due to our crash handler erroneously catching signals intended for wasmtime. (#49944)

  - Fixed interop detection on WSL not working on newer setups. (#49708)
  - Fixed linked edits for delete/change/substitute commands so tag pairs stay in sync. (#48458; thanks ixacik)
  - Fixed mouse scroll in terminal apps (tmux, neovim, etc.) only sending one scroll event when scrolling down, regardless of scroll amount. (#49931; thanks emamulandalib)
  - Fixed remote reconnect failing with an error when the server is not running, now establishes a fresh connection instead. (#49834; thanks mangas)
