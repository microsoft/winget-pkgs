ShortDescription: High-performance, multiplayer code editor from the creators of Atom and Tree-sitter.
Description: |-
  Zed is a next-generation code editor designed for high-performance collaboration with humans and AI.

  - Written from scratch in Rust to efficiently leverage multiple CPU cores and your GPU.
  - Integrate upcoming LLMs into your workflow to generate, transform, and analyze code.
  - Chat with teammates, write notes together, and share your screen and project. All included.
  - Zed now speaks WSL. You can open a Linux distro as a first-class “remote” target, edit projects that live inside it.
  - All of Zed’s AI features, including edit predictions and ACP-powered agents, are fully supported on Windows.
  - All Zed extensions now work seamlessly on Windows; no special steps, no caveats.
  - To run on almost all Windows versions, including VMs, we created a new rendering backend based on DirectX 11.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  This week's release brings the ability to deep-link to specific settings, git worktree management for opening worktrees in new windows, git pull --rebase support, GitLab and Gitee avatar support in git blame, improved git blame performance, and better keyboard input handling for international layouts and IMEs on Windows.
  Features
  AI
  - Agent: Added the ability to install ACP agents via extensions. There will be a blog post covering this soon! (#40663)
  - Agent: Added the ability to remove OpenAI-compatible LLM providers directly from the UI. (#41739; thanks aeroxy)
  - Agent: Added a button for refreshing available Ollama models. (#38181; thanks tidely)
  - Agent: Added Bedrock support for Claude Haiku 4.5. (#41045; thanks 5herlocked)
  - Agent: Improved the "waiting for confirmation" state visibility so that you more rapidly know the agent is waiting for you to act. (#41998)
  - Agent: Improved the "go to file" affordance in the edit bar. (#41762)
  - Agent: Improved agent edit single file reviews by making the "reject" and "accept" buttons appear at the same time. (#41718)
  - Agent: Improved the mode selector by preventing it from going off-screen in case the panel is docked to the left. (#41589; thanks diksipav)
  - Agent: Improved agent notifications to display when the agent panel is hidden, in addition to when the Zed window is in the background. (#40942; thanks cmclaughlin)
  - Agent: Improved the agent: add selection to thread action to automatically scroll to the cursor's position after selections are inserted. (#41370)
  - Added experimental terminal-based authentication to ACP support. (#41954)
  - Added the ability to switch between configured edit prediction providers through the status bar menu. (#41504)
  Git
  - Added git: worktree creation action and git worktree picker to open a git worktree on a new window or replace the current one. (#38719; thanks AlvaroParker)
  - Added git: pull rebase for running git pull --rebase. (#41117; thanks Sathiyaraman-M)
  - Added support for showing GitLab and self-hosted GitLab avatars in git blame. (#41747; thanks amtoaer)
  - Added support for showing Gitee avatars in git blame. (#41783; thanks amtoaer)
  - Improved UI feedback in the Git panel when a commit is in progress. (#41686; thanks joeinnes)
  - Improved git blame performance by reducing the number of concurrent git processes spawned. (#41472)
  Debugger
  - Allowed adding conditions, logs, and hit conditions to breakpoints when there's no active session. (#41598)
  - Added horizontal scroll bars to variable list, memory view, and breakpoint list. (#41594)
  - Improved the debugger query console to no longer needlessly scroll past its content. (#41838)
  - Improved monorepo virtual environment detection with Debugpy. (#40975)
  Settings UI
  - Added the ability to copy a link to a given setting, allowing users to quickly open the settings window at the correct location in a faster way. (#41172)
  Languages
  - Go: Added syntax highlighting support for the new ignore directive in go.mod files. (#41520; thanks pigletfly)

  - Helix: Added workspace: toggle helix mode action to the command palette. (#41454)
  - Helix: Improved the behavior of vim::MoveToNextMatch and search::SelectNextMatch (as well as their previous counterparts) when using helix mode.
