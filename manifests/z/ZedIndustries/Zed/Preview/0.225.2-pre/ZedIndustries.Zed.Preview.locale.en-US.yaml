ShortDescription: High-performance, multiplayer code editor from the creators of Atom and Tree-sitter.
Description: |-
  Zed is a next-generation code editor designed for high-performance collaboration with humans and AI.

  - Written from scratch in Rust to efficiently leverage multiple CPU cores and your GPU.
  - Integrate upcoming LLMs into your workflow to generate, transform, and analyze code.
  - Chat with teammates, write notes together, and share your screen and project. All included.
  - Zed now speaks WSL. You can open a Linux distro as a first-class “remote” target, edit projects that live inside it.
  - All of Zed’s AI features, including edit predictions and ACP-powered agents, are fully supported on Windows.
  - All Zed extensions now work seamlessly on Windows; no special steps, no caveats.
  - To run on almost all Windows versions, including VMs, we created a new rendering backend based on DirectX 11.
