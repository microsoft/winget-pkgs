ShortDescription: High-performance, multiplayer code editor from the creators of Atom and Tree-sitter.
Description: |-
  Zed is a next-generation code editor designed for high-performance collaboration with humans and AI.

  - Written from scratch in Rust to efficiently leverage multiple CPU cores and your GPU.
  - Integrate upcoming LLMs into your workflow to generate, transform, and analyze code.
  - Chat with teammates, write notes together, and share your screen and project. All included.
  - Zed now speaks WSL. You can open a Linux distro as a first-class “remote” target, edit projects that live inside it.
  - All of Zed’s AI features, including edit predictions and ACP-powered agents, are fully supported on Windows.
  - All Zed extensions now work seamlessly on Windows; no special steps, no caveats.
  - To run on almost all Windows versions, including VMs, we created a new rendering backend based on DirectX 11.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  This week's release includes command palette history (press up to recall recently executed commands), git remotes support, branch names on git conflict buttons instead of HEAD/ORIGIN, automatic file context detection when pasting code into the agent panel, Grok 4.1 Fast models with 2M token context windows and vision support, and new RotateSelectionsForward/RotateSelectionsBackward actions for rotating content across multiple cursors.
  Features
  AI
  - Agent: Added automatic file context detection when pasting code into the AI agent panel. Pasted code now displays as collapsible badges showing the file path and line numbers (e.g., "app/layout.tsx (18-25)"). (#42982; thanks ddoemonn)
  - Agent: Added support for Grok 4.1 Fast (reasoning and non-reasoning) models in the xAI provider, with 2M token context windows and full vision capabilities. (#43419; thanks mInrOz)
  - Agent: Extended 2M token context to existing Grok 4 Fast variants (from 128K) for consistency with xAI updates. (#43419; thanks mInrOz)
  - Agent: Enabled image/vision support for all Grok 4 family models. (#43419; thanks mInrOz)
  - Agent: Added support for displaying the human-readable names of extension-provided agents in the agent menu. (#44496)
  - Agent: Fallback to locally installed Codex version if update fails. (#44419)
  - Agent: UI now shows the checked state of a list item. (#43567; thanks RemcoSmitsDev)
  - Edit Prediction: Improved cursor movement performance when edit predictions are enabled. (#44161)
  - Bedrock: Added opt-in allow_global which enables global endpoints. (#44103; thanks 5herlocked)
  - Bedrock: Updated cross-region-inference endpoint and model list. (#44103; thanks 5herlocked)
  Git

  Breaking Changes and Notices
  - Removed the actions collab::ToggleMute, collab::ToggleDeafen, and collab::ToggleScreenshare. These actions were never functional due to a registration issue, so any keybindings using them would not have worked. If you have keybindings for these actions, update them to use collab::Mute, collab::Deafen, and collab::ScreenShare instead. (#44432)
