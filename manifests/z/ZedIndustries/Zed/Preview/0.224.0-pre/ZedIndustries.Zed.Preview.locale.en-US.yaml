ShortDescription: High-performance, multiplayer code editor from the creators of Atom and Tree-sitter.
Description: |-
  Zed is a next-generation code editor designed for high-performance collaboration with humans and AI.

  - Written from scratch in Rust to efficiently leverage multiple CPU cores and your GPU.
  - Integrate upcoming LLMs into your workflow to generate, transform, and analyze code.
  - Chat with teammates, write notes together, and share your screen and project. All included.
  - Zed now speaks WSL. You can open a Linux distro as a first-class “remote” target, edit projects that live inside it.
  - All of Zed’s AI features, including edit predictions and ACP-powered agents, are fully supported on Windows.
  - All Zed extensions now work seamlessly on Windows; no special steps, no caveats.
  - To run on almost all Windows versions, including VMs, we created a new rendering backend based on DirectX 11.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  This week's release includes side-by-side diff viewing, LSP semantic tokens highlighting, granular per-tool permission settings for the Agent, and further safeguards against the Agent running destructive commands.
  Features
  AI
  - Agent: Introduced per-tool permission settings, including regexes for controlling when tools may be auto-allowed, auto-denied, or always require confirmation. (#48553)
  - Agent: Added Claude Opus 4.6 and 4.6 Thinking with Cross region inference for US, EU, and Global endpoints. (#48525; thanks 5herlocked)
  - Agent: Improved terminal command safety by auto-blocking a wider range of dangerous commands (e.g. rm -rf $HOME in addition to rm -rf ~), detecting commands hidden in I/O redirects, here-documents, and compound command constructs, and detecting path traversal attacks in destructive commands. (#48399, #48635, #48640)
  - Agent: Added a Latest indicator to highlight the latest models available through the Zed provider. (#48614)
  - Agent: Added alt-l as an alternate keybinding for agent::CycleFavoriteModels on Linux and Windows, since alt-tab conflicts with the OS app switcher. (#48390)
  - Agent: Changed the Agent Panel so that the active thread is restored on restart. (#47795)
  - Agent: Changed file and directory tool operations to require confirmation before modifying sensitive settings paths. (#48641)
  - Agent: Improved image insertion by placing images at the cursor position. (#48779)
  Git
  - Added support for viewing diffs in split ("side by side") mode. (#48912)
  Debugger
  - Improved DAP settings so that it is possible to override individual fields, such as binary. (#43647; thanks fredr)
  Languages
  - C++: Added attribute highlighting. (#47825; thanks ozacod)
  - C/C++: Changed preprocessor directive highlighting to use a dedicated @preproc capture group, allowing themes to style them independently from language keywords. (#48109; thanks ozacod)
  Vim / Helix
  - Improved Vim's subword motions to stop at $ and = characters. (#48276)
  Collaboration
  - Added a Show Active Channels button to the collab panel to filter down to only channels with participants. (#48826)

  Other
  - Added LSP semantic tokens highlighting support. (#46356)
  - Moved the update Zed button to the title bar and allowed it to be dismissed. (#48467)
  - Improved resource usage by reducing work when the system is under high thermal stress. (#45638; thanks marcocondrache)
  - Added tab_switcher::OpenInActivePane to allow a more vim-like tab switching experience. (#47079; thanks baldwindavid)
  - Added project panel: collapse selected entry and children action that collapses the selected directory and all its subdirectories. (#47328; thanks austincummings)
  - Added Collapse All option to the Project Panel context menu for all directories, not just project roots. (#47328; thanks austincummings)
  - Added autocomplete support for the settings field in LSP configuration, complementing the existing initialization_options autocomplete. (#48332; thanks aviatesk)
  - Added textDocument/foldingRange LSP support. Use "lsp_folding_ranges": "on" in language settings to fetch and prefer the LSP folds. (#48611)
  - Added global_lsp_settings.request_timeout setting to configure the maximum timeout duration for LSP-related operations. (#44745; thanks Bertie690)
  - Improved compatibility with legacy language servers. (#48587; thanks shaz-r)
  - REPL: Added error display when parsing a message from a Jupyter kernel fails. (#48837; thanks rgbkrk)
