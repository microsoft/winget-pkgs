ShortDescription: High-performance, multiplayer code editor from the creators of Atom and Tree-sitter.
Description: |-
  Zed is a next-generation code editor designed for high-performance collaboration with humans and AI.

  - Written from scratch in Rust to efficiently leverage multiple CPU cores and your GPU.
  - Integrate upcoming LLMs into your workflow to generate, transform, and analyze code.
  - Chat with teammates, write notes together, and share your screen and project. All included.
  - Zed now speaks WSL. You can open a Linux distro as a first-class “remote” target, edit projects that live inside it.
  - All of Zed’s AI features, including edit predictions and ACP-powered agents, are fully supported on Windows.
  - All Zed extensions now work seamlessly on Windows; no special steps, no caveats.
  - To run on almost all Windows versions, including VMs, we created a new rendering backend based on DirectX 11.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  This week's release includes session history for external agents, agent panel restoration (so your threads survive editor restarts), thinking effort level controls for supported models, mermaid diagram support in markdown preview, and the option to include LSP document symbols in breadcrumbs and outline UI ("document_symbols": "on").
  Features
  AI
  - ACP: Exposed session history for the following external agents: Auggie, Claude Agent, Codex, Factory Droid, Junie, Kimi CLI, Mistral Vibe, and OpenCode. (#49449)
  - Agent: Added support for controlling thinking effort levels with supported models using the Zed provider. (#49274)
  - Agent: Added support for installing ACP agents via ACP registry in remote projects. (#48935)
  - Agent: Added agent panel restoration. Now restarting your editor won't cause your thread to be forgotten. (#48800)
  - Agent: Changed "Always allow" suggestions for terminal commands to be subcommand-specific (e.g. "Always allow for cargo build commands" instead of "Always allow for cargo commands"). (#49148)
  - Agent: Added allow_extended_context to the Bedrock settings which enables 1M context windows on models that support it. (#48542; thanks 5herlocked)
  - Agent: Added image input support for Amazon Bedrock models with vision capabilities. (#47673; thanks Gitarth)
  - Agent: Improved Bedrock error messages: region-locked models ask the user to try a different region, rate limits and access errors are reported cleanly instead of as raw API responses. (#49287; thanks 5herlocked)
  - Agent: Streamlined Bedrock model list to 39 curated models. (#49287; thanks 5herlocked)
  - Agent: Added prompt caching for Mistral AI. (#48584; thanks vianney)
  - Agent: Changed the way context window is set for Ollama at the provider level instead of per model. (#44506; thanks sbe-arg)
  - Agent: Added a prompt for permission if the agent tries to access files whose symlinks resolve outside the current workspace. (#49255)
  - Agent: Improved context window usage display with a circular progress indicator. (#49138)
  - Agent: Added a disable_ai project setting to allow disabling AI for a specific project via .zed/settings.json. (#47902; thanks oliverbarnes)
  - Agent: Added cost multiplier display for GitHub Copilot models in the model selector. (#44800; thanks Sathiyaraman-M)
  Git
  - Added a git init button to the Git panel to initialize a new Git repository. (#49203; thanks cppcoffee)
  - Improved the visual display for spacers in the split diff view. (#49478)
  - Changed diff hunk controls to stick to the top of the editor viewport if the top part of the hunk is outside the viewport. (#49260)
  - Improved performance with large diffs when toggling between diff views. (#49400)
  - Improved project diff performance when opening very large diffs/repositories. (#49278)
  Languages
  - Bash: Added runnable support. (#48807; thanks ozacod)
  - Bash: Added shebang highlight support. (#48064; thanks ozacod)
  - Bash: Improved function parameter highlighting. (#48067; thanks ozacod)

  - Go: Improved language detection to now recognize executable Go scripts with first-line 'go run' comments. (#48913; thanks dastrobu)
  - Added automatic syntax highlighting for GeoJSON files. (#49261; thanks flother)
  Vim / Helix
  - Vim: Added :bd / :bdelete command, which closes the file in all panes where it's open. (#48988)
  Collaboration
  - Added ability to select audio input/output devices as part of the Collaboration page in Settings. Added ability to test selected devices with a simple playback loop routing input directly into output for easier debugging of your audio devices. (#49015)
