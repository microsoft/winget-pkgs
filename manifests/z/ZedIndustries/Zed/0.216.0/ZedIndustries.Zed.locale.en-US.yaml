ShortDescription: High-performance, multiplayer code editor from the creators of Atom and Tree-sitter.
Description: |-
  Zed is a next-generation code editor designed for high-performance collaboration with humans and AI.
  - Written from scratch in Rust to efficiently leverage multiple CPU cores and your GPU.
  - Integrate upcoming LLMs into your workflow to generate, transform, and analyze code.
  - Chat with teammates, write notes together, and share your screen and project. All included.
  - Zed now speaks WSL. You can open a Linux distro as a first-class “remote” target, edit projects that live inside it.
  - All of Zed’s AI features, including edit predictions and ACP-powered agents, are fully supported on Windows.
  - All Zed extensions now work seamlessly on Windows; no special steps, no caveats.
  - To run on almost all Windows versions, including VMs, we created a new rendering backend based on DirectX 11.

  The leaderboard is filling up with incredible contributions of all sizes. We'll announce who's at the top of the board in next week's release notes. In the meantime, watch this space.
  It's not too late to join! Check out our git board and tackle an issue with the team.
  ⭐ = Shipped via Let's Git Together
  - Added word diff highlighting in expanded diff hunks (less than 5 lines), configurable via the word_diff_enabled language setting (defaults to true). (#43269)
  - ⭐Added a File history view accessible via right-click context menu on files in the editor, project panel, or git panel. Shows commit history for the selected file with author, timestamp, and commit message. Clicking a commit opens a diff view filtered to show only changes for that specific file. (#42441; thanks ddoemonn, #44016)
  - ⭐Added UI for deleting Git branches. (#42703; thanks errmayank)
  - Improved performance of multibuffers by spawning git blame processes on the background threads. (#43918)
  - Improved git project diff responsiveness. (#43706)
  - Improved overall git experience when loading buffers with massive git history where they would block other git jobs from running (such as staging/unstaging/committing). Now, git-blame runs separately from the git job queue on the side and the buffer with blame hints when finished thus unblocking other git operations. (#43565)
  - ⭐Git will now check pushRemote and pushDefault configurations before falling back to branch remote. (#41700; thanks errmayank)
  - ⭐Increased the askpass timeout for Git operations from 17 to 300 seconds and improved the error message. (#42946; thanks 11happy)
  - ⭐Fixed a bug where hover tooltips in git commit and blame popovers were not consistently using the UI font. (#43975; thanks GoldStrikeArch)
  - Fixed git features not working when a Windows host collaborates with a Unix guest. (#43515)
  - Fixed git ignored directories appearing as empty when their content changes on Windows. (#44143)
  Debugger
  - Improved "debug test" experience in Rust with ignored tests. (#43110; thanks mikeHag)
  Languages
  - Rust: Changed completion tab stops to display inline rather than as a raw LSP snippet expression. (#43891)
  - Python: Improved sorting order of pyright/basedpyright code completions. (#44050; thanks alkasadist)
  - Added JavaScript highlighting via YAML injections.scm for script blocks of actions/github-script. (#43771; thanks novusnota)
  - Added support for Tailwind suggestions and validations for the Gleam programming language. (#43968; thanks arjunbajaj)
  - Added way to configure ESLint's working directories in settings. For example: {"lsp":{"eslint":{"settings":{"workingDirectories":["./client","./server"]}}}}. (#43677)
  - Added Doxygen grammar support for C/C++ files. (#43581; thanks Clement-Lap)
  - Improved grammar for "Shell Script". (#44009)
  - Changed C preprocessor directives to use keyword.directive for syntax highlighting, matching C++ behavior. (#44043; thanks lipcut)
  Vim / Helix
  - Added ctrl-w x keybinding in Vim mode, which swaps the active window with the next adjacent one (aligning with Vim behavior). (#42792; thanks mfroeh)
  - Improved the % vim motion for HTML by moving the cursor to the opening tag when positioned on the / (slash) of the closing tag. (#42513; thanks Pranav2612000)
  Windows
  - Improved responsiveness when there are many tasks running in the foreground. (#43682)
  - Reduced hangs in some situations. (#43678)
  Linux
  - Improved Wayland key repeat rate precision. (#43589; thanks olejorgenb)
  Other
  - Improved performance for editors of large multibuffers with many different files. (#43709)
  - Improved performance of large project searches and project diffs. (#43888)
  - Added a keybinding (cmd-, (macOS) / ctrl-, (Windows / Linux)) to open the settings.json file when the Settings UI is in focus. (#43747)
  - Added Show Tab Bar Buttons setting to Settings UI to control visibility of New, Split Pane, and Zoom buttons in the tab bar. (#43746; thanks baldwindavid)
  - Improved visibility of long path names in context completions by truncating on the left when space is insufficient to render the full path. (#42682; thanks schurchley)
  - Changed pane::ActivatePreviousItem and pane::ActivateNextItem to toggle the most recent pane when called from a dock panel. (#42588; thanks FloppyDisco)
  - Added file icon for the Odin programming language. (#43855; thanks olrtg)
  - Added the ability to disable direnv integration entirely by setting "load_direnv": "disabled". (#43764; thanks ian-h-chamberlain)
  - Added banners to the extensions page when searching for Basedpyright, Ruff, or Ty, indicating that these features are now built-in. (#43872; thanks Rani367)
  - Enhanced color logic for phantom elements to improve visual distinction based on collision status. (#42710; thanks libondev)
