ReleaseNotes: |-
  What is new in version 6.9-stable?
    1 Fixed the issue with the Updater module that causes it to prevent Temp_Cleaner GUI from starting until it finishes checking for updates.
    2 Improved the overall behavior of the Updater window & module.
    3 Added a 25 seconds timeout for the check for updates function (to prevent the issue of the program staying in the background for too long)
    4 Improved overall program exception handling
    5 Improved the way Temp_Cleaner GUI displays and handles errors.
    6 Major bug fixes and improvements to the behavior of some cleaners.
    7 Minor improvements in overall code readability.
    8 Now the Legacy Microsoft Edge Windows Store Version cleaner is automated! (I know this should have been automated since the first release of Temp_Cleaner GUI, I am sorry I forgot about it ;-;)
    Please note that not all new features and bug fixes are listed here, and you may see other improvements/or new features that aren't listed here.
