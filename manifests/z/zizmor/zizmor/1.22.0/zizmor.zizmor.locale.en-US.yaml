ShortDescription: Static analysis for GitHub Actions.
Description: |-
  zizmor is a static analysis tool for GitHub Actions.

  It can find many common security issues in typical GitHub Actions CI/CD setups, including:
  - Template injection vulnerabilities, leading to attacker-controlled code execution
  - Accidental credential persistence and leakage
  - Excessive permission scopes and credential grants to runners
  - Impostor commits and confusable git references
  - ...and much more!
