ShortDescription: Static analysis for GitHub Actions.
Description: |-
  zizmor is a static analysis tool for GitHub Actions.

  It can find many common security issues in typical GitHub Actions CI/CD setups, including:
  - Template injection vulnerabilities, leading to attacker-controlled code execution
  - Accidental credential persistence and leakage
  - Excessive permission scopes and credential grants to runners
  - Impostor commits and confusable git references
  - ...and much more!

ReleaseNotes: |-
  New Features 🌈🔗
  - New audit: misfeature detects usage of GitHub Actions features that are considered "misfeatures." (#1517)
  Enhancements 🌱🔗
  - zizmor now uses exit code 3 to signal an audit that has failed because no input files were collected. See the exit code documentation for details (#1515)
  - The unpinned-uses audit now supports auto-fixes for many findings (#1525)
  Changes ⚠️🔗
  - The obfuscation audit no longer flags shell: cmd. That check has been moved to the new misfeature audit. Users may need to update their ignore comments and/or configuration (#1517)
  Bug Fixes 🐛🔗
  - The unpinned-uses audit now flags reusable workflows that are unpinned, in addition to actions (#1509)
    Many thanks to @johnbillion for implementing this fix!
