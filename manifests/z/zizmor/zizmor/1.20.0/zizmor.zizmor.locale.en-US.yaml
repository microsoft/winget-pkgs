ShortDescription: Static analysis for GitHub Actions.
Description: |-
  zizmor is a static analysis tool for GitHub Actions.

  It can find many common security issues in typical GitHub Actions CI/CD setups, including:
  - Template injection vulnerabilities, leading to attacker-controlled code execution
  - Accidental credential persistence and leakage
  - Excessive permission scopes and credential grants to runners
  - Impostor commits and confusable git references
  - ...and much more!

  Enhancements 🌱🔗
  - The excessive-permissions audit is now aware of the artifact-metadata and models permissions (#1461)
  - The cache-poisoning audit is now aware of the ramsey/composer-install action (#1489)
  - The unpinned-images audit is now significantly more precise in the presence of matrix references, e.g. image: ${{ matrix.image }} (#1482)
  Changes ⚠️🔗
  - The default policy for the unpinned-uses audit has changed from allowing ref-pinning for first-party actions (those under actions/* and similar) to requiring hash-pinning. This makes the default policy more strict, as well as more consistent across the actions ecosystem.
    Users who with to retain the old (permissive policy) for first-party actions may configure it explicitly in their zizmor.yml:
  zizmor.yml
  rules:
    unpinned-uses:
      config:
        policies:
          actions/*: ref-pin
          github/*: ref-pin
          dependabot/*: ref-pin
  Bug Fixes 🐛🔗
  - The dependabot-cooldown audit no longer flags missing cooldowns on ecosystems that don't (yet) support cooldowns, such as opentofu (#1480)
  - Fixed a false positive in the cache-poisoning audit where zizmor would treat empty strings (e.g. cache: '') as enabling rather than disabling caching (#1482)
  - Fixed two gaps in the use-trusted-publishing audit's detection of common yarn publishing commands (#1495)
  Miscellaneous 🛠🔗
  - zizmor's configuration now has an official JSON schema that will be available via SchemaStore soon!
    Many thanks to @kiwamizamurai for implementing this improvement!
