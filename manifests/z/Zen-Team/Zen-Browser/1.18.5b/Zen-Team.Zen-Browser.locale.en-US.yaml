ReleaseNotes: |-
  Zen Stable Release
  This update includes a new setting to allow users who didn't like the window sync feature but still want to sync their pinned tabs across windows in a workspace to do so. Make sure window sync is enabled in about:config for this feature to work.
  New Features
  - Added 'Sync only pinned tabs in workspaces' option to the 'Tab Management' settings so that only pinned tabs will be synced across windows in a workspace. This is useful for users who want to keep their pinned tabs consistent across windows while allowing unpinned tabs to be different in each window.
  - Updated to Firefox 147.0.3
  Fixes
  - Fixed an issue when drag and dropping tabs from normal windows to blank windows
  - Fixed an issue on Windows systems with a large number of fonts installed where parts of the UI (tabs, menus, and Settings) could display garbled characters or symbols instead of readable text.
