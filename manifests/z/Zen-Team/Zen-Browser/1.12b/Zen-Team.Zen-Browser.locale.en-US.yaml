ReleaseNotes: |-
  Zen Stable Release
  A nice update that brings some cool new features and fixes!
  We are also excited to announce that we moved into floss.social!
  In response to recent privacy concerns, we've significantly strengthened Zen's privacy measures. Previously, we only disabled telemetry, but some minimal pings were still being sent. Now, Firefox telemetry has been completely stripped out from the core.
  Additionally, onboarding pages and initial essentials favicons are now locally bundled and our website no longer relies on any external services/CDNs and/or cloudflare services. Initial essentials selected on startup will only be loaded once clicked on the tab as well, meaning connections wont be done until you explicitly enter the tab. We also changed our initial essentials variations to more private/productivity focused sites.
  Only essential security updates and other non-telemetry-related services remain. As a result, the number of external connections has dropped from 82 to around 20-10 â€” factoring in that Zen's site is loaded twice (for the welcome page and privacy policy).
  Psst. With the release of Firefox 138, folders are just around the corner!
  New Features
  - Updated to Firefox 138.1
  - Increased privacy and reduced initial connections at startup
  - Added a really smooth animation when downloading files. Thanks to @BrielOtero on github!
  - New, fully containerized essentials are out! It allows having different essentials based on your workspace's container. It can be enabled by going into about:preferences -> tab management -> allow container specific essentials
  - Auto-Picture-in-Picture wont activate if the video is muted
  - Added homepage button and export/import buttons to the mods page for easier access. Thanks to @Pdzly on github!
  - More efficient workspace switching, by only animating what we need and warming up the tabs before switching
  - New looks for the URL bar!
  - Essentials layouts get a nice revamp to better use the space
  - Added a search engine selection form for the onboarding page
  - Did internat refactoring to certain components in order to comply with Firefox's new security standards.
