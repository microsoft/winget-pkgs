  - Added theme commands for the urlbar commands
  - Added 'Open Link in Glance' option to link context menu
  - Added the options to make Ctrl+Tab cycling to keep within essentials/regular tabs only, and another option with the same behavior but for pending tabs
  - With the new Open links from apps next to your active tab setting, you can have links from other applications open next to your active tab instead of at the end of the tab strip.
  - Enhanced Bounce Tracking Protection's stateless mode is now enabled by default in ETP Strict, blocking more advanced tracking techniques based on redirection
