ReleaseNotes: |-
  Zen Stable Release
  You asked, we delivered: Folders have arrived in Zen! Organise your browsing the way you want. Create a folder from the sidebar with the plus (+) button, give it a name, then drag and drop tabs inside. Right–click a folder to rename or delete it, and rearrange them anytime to keep projects or saved links in order. Folders have been one of the most requested features since Zen’s launch, and they’re finally here.
