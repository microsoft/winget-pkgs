ReleaseNotes: |-
  Zen Stable Release
  This update includes window sync and other nice improvements! Window sync is a way to keep your windows organized across multiple monitors. If you wan't a blank window, you can do so by using opt+cmd+N (for mac), ctrl+alt+N (for linux) and alt+N (for windows). Enjoy!
  You can read more about window sync in our documentation here
  New Features
  - Updated to Firefox 147.0 and 147.0.1
  - Merged window syncing! Now, when you open multiple windows of Zen, they will stay in sync with each other. Changes made in one window will automatically reflect in all other open windows. (Experimental, some features such as glance still can't sync yet.)
  - Session restore now remembers which space each window was in.
  - Closing a tab will now focus the last accessed tab instead of the tab to the bottom
  - Tabs can now have custom icons (set via right-click context menu).
  - Implemented new tab drag-and-drop system, making it easier to rearrange tabs specially when multiple layers of folders are involved.
  - You can now collapse all pinned tabs by clicking on the space name below the essentials.
  - Before, only pinned tabs could be renamed; now, any tab can be renamed via right-click context menu or double-clicking the tab title.
  - New MacOS profiles will now have 'switch to N space' keyboard shortcuts filled by default (control+number).
  - Improved native menu bar integration on MacOS (and Windows/Linux if applicable), adding a 'Spaces' menu item for easier access to space-related actions.
  - Enabled de-cluttering preference for context menus.
  - WebGPU support is now enabled for devices with Apple Silicon processors on all supported macOS versions.
  - Improved video playback performance on systems with AMD GPUs by enabling zero-copy playback for hardware-decoded video where supported, bringing them to parity with Intel and NVIDIA GPUs.
  - Zen now supports the Safe Browsing V5 protocol and is migrating from Safe Browsing V4 to the local list mode of Safe Browsing V5 protocol.
  - Added an 'Essentials DnD Promo' card, shown when dragging a tab to the top of the sidebar if there are no essentials.
  Fixes
  - Improved startup time when restoring large sessions.
  - Improved rendering for background gradient rendering / mixing when using three color gradients.
  - Fixed split views resetting their layout / sizes on startup. (#9978)
  - Fixed pinned tabs losing their icons when being unloaded or at startup.
  - Fixed sub-folders separating from their parent folders when restoring in some cases.
  - Fixed a possible memory leak with mods.
