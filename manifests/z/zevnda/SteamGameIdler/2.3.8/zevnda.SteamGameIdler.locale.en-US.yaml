  Changes in v2.3.8
  - Improved the look of the sidebar
    - Grouped related items/features into categories
    - Added current user information to the lower section with settings and sign out buttons
  - Improved the logic for getting a user's games with card drops remaining
    - Removed a early return condition which could cause some games with completed badges, but also with card drops remaining, to not be returned
    - SGI will now parse all user badges pages https://steamcommunity.com/my/badges/
    - While this change is more robust, it also means that it may take longer to fetch this data for users with a lot of badges
  - To avoid confusion, the free games item in the sidebar will now always be visible
    - When there are free games available for you to claim, the free games button will be gold, and the available games will be shown in the list
    - You will still receive desktop notifications (if enabled) when free games are available for you to claim
    - free games has been moved to the new games cateogry in the sidebar
  - Fixed an infinite loading issue on the sign in screen when no Steam users were found
