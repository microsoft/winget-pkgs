  Release Summary
  Wasabi Wallet v2.0.8.1 adds additional safeguards for coinjoin fees. Clients can now set their own fee policies to avoid participating in coinjoin rounds that cost more than expected.
  Set Maximum coinjoin mining fee rate:
  In previous versions of Wasabi, transaction fees for coinjoins were controlled using the ‚ÄúCoinjoin Time Preference‚Äù setting. This abstracts the concept of fees so users can coinjoin at the cheapest time of the day, week, or month.
  This version allows users to specify the exact fee threshold (in sats/vbyte) that they are willing to pay so that overpriced rounds are skipped. The default maximum fee rate is set to 150 sats/vbyte.
  Set maximum coinjoin coordination service fee:
  Coinjoin coordinators may charge a service fee from participants in their rounds. Before, clients automatically rejected any coordinator fee over 1%. However, this is not sufficient to protect users against reckless coordinator configs that provide little privacy per round without free remixing.
  The default coordination fee rate is now set to 0%, users can opt in to increasing this limit in order to use paid coordinators.
  Verify coinjoin mining fee rate matches requested rate:
  If a coordinator requests a specific fee rate at input registration, clients will ensure that the final fee rate matches (or exceeds) the originally requested value. This prevents a malicious coordinator from pocketing fees that users intended to pay to miners.
