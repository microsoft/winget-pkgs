  Release Summary
  Wasabi Wallet v2.5.0 continues to enhance Wasabi's resilience and contains small but insightful improvements to the interface.
  v2.5.1
  v2.5.1 Fixes a bug with the recovery workflow introduced in v2.5.0
  üí™ 3rd Party Providers for Fee Estimations & Exchange Rate
  Fee rate estimations and exchange rate providers are now configurable.
  Previously, this information was provided by Wasabi's backend. This change aligns with our long-term goal of completely removing dependence on the backend.
  After this release, Wasabi will be significantly closer to achieving that goal, with most basic wallet features functioning without an active backend connection. You can read more about the remaining steps on GitHub.
  üë®‚Äçüîß Quality of Life Features
  In the last version, we introduced a donation button to gauge community interest in funding Wasabi's future. We have been overwhelmed by the support and interest shown by our community, including long-time users and privacy enthusiasts.
  We want to thank you for believing in Wasabi and for your support, whether through using the software, providing feedback, contributing financially, or contributing to the open-source project in any form.
  To show our gratitude, we've designed this release for you, our community. We've finally addressed some of the oldest bugs and feature requests that have been long-awaited!
  Listing all the improvements would be too lengthy, but here are some examples:
  - Randomly skipping rounds was removed
  - Coinjoin settings & profiles are now all in a single tab
  - More information in the status icon
  - Resync button now available in Tools
    And much more...
  We expect these improvements to significantly enhance the overall experience of using Wasabi as your daily Bitcoin wallet. Take a tour or read the release details on GitHub to see all of them!
  üì¶ Backend and Coordinator packaged for Linux
  The Debian package now includes two extra binaries: one for the backend (Wallet API) and one for the coordinator (Coinjoin API).
  This makes it easier for community members to run a backend and/or a coordinator, private or publicly accessible, which lowers the barrier to contributing to the resiliency of Wasabi's infrastructure against potential attacks and technical failures.
  Installation Guide
  Download the operating system relevant software package and install Wasabi like you would with any other software on your computer.
  For a detailed installation guide, including signature verification, see the documentation.
