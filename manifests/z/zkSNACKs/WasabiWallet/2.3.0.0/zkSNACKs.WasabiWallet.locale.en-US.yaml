  Release Summary
  Wasabi Wallet v2.3.0.0 release
  This version of Wasabi introduces major improvements to the user experience with a more intuitive and useful interface, while continuing our efforts to enhance and streamline the codebase for easier maintainability and better building blocks for further improvements.
  üåê Enhanced Tor integration
  We‚Äôve completely rewritten our Tor integration, replacing custom code with a more efficient, standard HttpClient. This not only improves performance but also enhances code clarity, making it easier to review which identities are used in specific contexts. This reduces potential errors and improves the wallet's overall security.
  üìä Better BTC amount formatting
  Amount formatting has been significantly improved across the wallet, offering clearer readability for both small and large balances, whether you want to read as BTC (decimals) or Sats. The aesthetics of all screens presenting amounts have been revisited to be smoother and consistent throughout the application.
  üîç More insight on transactions
  The Preview Transaction and Transaction Details dialogs now include a lists of inputs and outputs. This long-requested feature offers insight into the privacy-enhancing effects of coinjoins and the level of anonymity achieved with each transaction. Additionally, it is now visually clear how privacy suggestions improves transactions.
  üí∞ [Beta] Payment in coinjoin (RPC only)
  Our Payment in coinjoin feature is now officially in beta! It is currently accessible only though the RPC. While this feature is still in development and lacks certain functionalities, we encourage users to test it and provide feedback. Learn more about it in the Documentation
  üîí Trezor Safe 5 & ColdCard Q support
  Hardware Wallet Interface (HWI) has been updated to version 3.1.0 along with support for Trezor Safe 5 & ColdCard Q.

  What's Changed
  [!IMPORTANT] This client version is a soft fork for the coinjoin implementation. Clients on v2.3.0.0 won't be able to coinjoin with coordinators running a version lower than tag v2.3.0.0. We therefore highly advise coordinators to update their backend to tag v2.3.0.0
