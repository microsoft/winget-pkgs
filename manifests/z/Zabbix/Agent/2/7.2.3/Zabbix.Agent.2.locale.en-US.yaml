ShortDescription: Zabbix is an enterprise-class open source distributed monitoring solution.
Description: |-
  Zabbix is a software that monitors numerous parameters of a network and the health and integrity
  of servers, virtual machines, applications, services, databases, websites, the cloud and more.
  Zabbix uses a flexible notification mechanism that allows users to configure email-based alerts
  for virtually any event. This allows a fast reaction to server problems. Zabbix offers excellent
  reporting and data visualization features based on the stored data. This makes Zabbix ideal for
  capacity planning.

  Zabbix supports both polling and trapping. All Zabbix reports and statistics, as well as
  configuration parameters, are accessed through a web-based frontend. A web-based frontend ensures
  that the status of your network and the health of your servers can be assessed from any location.
  Properly configured, Zabbix can play an important role in monitoring IT infrastructure. This is
  equally true for small organizations with a few servers and for large companies with a multitude
  of servers.
