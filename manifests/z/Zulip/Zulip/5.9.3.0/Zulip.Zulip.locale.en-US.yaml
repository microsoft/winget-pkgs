  Fixes:
  â€¢ Fixed a bug in the automatic updater that would sometimes close the application instead of updating it.
    (As with most updater fixes, this fix will take effect when updating from 5.9.3. If you're having trouble updating to 5.9.3, a workaround is to click Install Later rather than Install and Relaunch, then Quit from the menu bar and re-open the application manually.)

  Dependencies:
  â€¢ Upgraded all dependencies, including Electron 18.2.0.
