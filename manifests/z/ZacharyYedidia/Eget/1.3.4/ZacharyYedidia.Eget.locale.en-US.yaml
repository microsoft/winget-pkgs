ShortDescription: Easily install prebuilt binaries from GitHub.
Description: Eget is the best way to easily get pre-built binaries for your favorite tools. It downloads and extracts pre-built binaries from releases on GitHub. To use it, provide a repository and Eget will search through the assets from the latest release in an attempt to find a suitable prebuilt binary for your system. If one is found, the asset will be downloaded and Eget will extract the binary to the current directory. Eget should only be used for installing simple, static prebuilt binaries, where the extracted binary is all that is needed for installation. For more complex installation, you may use the --download-only option, and perform extraction manually.
