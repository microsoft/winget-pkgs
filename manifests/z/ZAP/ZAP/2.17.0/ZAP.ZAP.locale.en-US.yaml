ReleaseNotes: |-
  This is a bug fix and enhancement release.
  Alert De-duplication
  Changes have been made in order to reduce the number of alerts which ZAP may raise that are duplicates or highly similar, more closely being aligned with the Sites Tree representation. See the Alert De-duplication blog for further details.
  Systemic Alerts
  Alerts that are typically site-wide will now be flagged as being “Systemic” in both the ZAP Desktop UI and in reports.
  This can also significantly reduce the number of “duplicate” alerts reported.
  Insights
  A new “Insights” tab shows key information which is not related to vulnerabilities, or potentially even related to the application in question.
  Insights tell you more about your applications, about the effectiveness of a scan, and can even stop a scan early if significant problems are identified.
  Insights are also available in all of the official ZAP reports.
  Improved Disk and Memory Space Error Handling
  ZAP will now detect disk and memory space issues and attempt to handle them more gracefully.
  Any problems encountered will be reported via the Insights.
  Automation Disk Space Reduction
  Active Scan Temporary HTTP Messages are no longer persisted by default when ZAP is run headless. This can significantly reduce the amount of disk space needed.
  The option is also available in the Desktop but is turned off be default, so that the user can inspect them.
  Structured Reports ISO 8601 Standard Date
  The structured reports (JSON and XML) now have an ISO 8601 standard date field/attribute (“created”); the existing “generatedString” field will be removed in the future.
