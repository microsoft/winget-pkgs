ReleaseNotes: |-
  What's New
  - Support for the !#include directive in filter lists
    This improves compatibility with a wider range of filter lists, including regional ones.
  - :style() extended CSS pseudo-class support
    Zen is now even better at hiding unwanted elements on webpages.
  - Improved cache behavior
    Injected page assets are no longer cached by browsers, so pages update instantly when you change the configuration or turn Zen off.
  - Improved Linux support
    Added partial support for XFCE – thanks to @xoxorwr!
  - Other bug fixes and performance improvements.
  New Contributors
  - @xoxorwr made their first contribution in #558
