  What's New
  - Performance improvements
    We've optimized our filtering engine, with significant performance gains on long URLs.
  - Better UI
    The application now includes a new logo and a new font, improving visual consistency across platforms, along with other minor UI refinements.
  - Better injection reliability
    Improved handling of Content Security Policy (CSP) ensures that injections work more reliably across a wider range of sites. Thanks to @kasyap1234 for the contribution!
  - NSS trust store
    The app now also installs the CA certificate into the NSS trust store. This notably improves the experience on Firefox – you're now less likely to encounter certificate errors on first launch. Thanks @donnykd for implementing this!
  - More reliable proxy on macOS
    We've improved how the system proxy is configured on macOS, ensuring filtering remains active across all network interfaces. This also improves compatibility with various VPNs.
  - Other minor improvements and bug fixes.
  Thank you for using Zen!
