ReleaseNotes: |-
  Version 1.4.1 yesterday had a regression (#82 Drag&Drop does not work) and a race condition (#54 print only prints first page) which has
  now been corrected, addtionally to #83 NaN for VAT amount and rounding amount.This corrected version 1.4.2 of our open-source e-invoice reader "Quba" should be sufficient to get you into the next year, the next regular update is only planned for Q1/2025.Apologies for any inconvenience caused.
