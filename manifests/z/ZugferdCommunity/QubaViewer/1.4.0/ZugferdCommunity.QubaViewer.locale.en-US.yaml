ReleaseNotes: Quba is a invoice viewer supporting Peppol-, CII-, UBL-, XRechnung-  and Factur-X/ZUGFeRD.Through sponsorship of  the new version 1.4 can now also display orders in the Order-X-format.The XML part of hybrid invoices and orders is now also shown immediately next to the PDF-view.The removal of the "extra click" which was so far neccessary for this purpose has been removed as part of the preparation for the planned mandatory german domestic B2B-e-invoicing.Quba is open source, can also validate invoices and orders using Mustangserver when online and can be downloaded free of charge for Linux, Windows and Mac.
