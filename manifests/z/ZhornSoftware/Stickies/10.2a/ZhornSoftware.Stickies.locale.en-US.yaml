ShortDescription: Stickies is a PC utility I wrote to try to cut down on the number of yellow notes I was leaving stuck to my monitor. It is a computerised version of those notes.
Description: |-
  The design goal behind Stickies is that the program is small and simple. Stickies will not mess with your system files, or write to the registry. Stickies stores information in a single SQLITE database file.

  Features
  * Once on screen, notes will remain where placed until closed, even through reboots
  * Stickies appearance can be customised; fonts, colours and buttons may be changed, and styles saved. Notes can be resized.
  * Stickies can store text or images
  * Stickies can be hidden for a certain period, until a specified date and time, or to wake every day, week or month, to act as reminders.
  * Stickies can have alarms set to ensure you notice them at a point you choose
  * International language, Unicode and RTL text support
  * Stickies can snap to each other and to the sides of the screen to keep them neatly lined up
  * Stickies can be attached to an application, web site, document or folder so they only show when it's on screen
  * Stickies can be transferred from one machine to another either over a TCP/IP network connection, or by using an SMTP mail server or MAPI client
  * Hierarchical friends list, which may be automatically transferred from other friends
  * Stickies is small and simple, it writes to a database file, and does not alter the registry
  * AD network administrators can use Group Policy to control settings
  * API to allow integration with other applications
  * ...and Stickies is completely free!
