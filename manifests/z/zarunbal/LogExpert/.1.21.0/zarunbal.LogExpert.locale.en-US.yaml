  - Columnizers have now all json configuration files, but still can read the old xml files (but are saved in json)
  What will the Future bring
  - Beginning with the new year, there will be an effort to optimize performance while loading, reading, closing and filtering files, this will be realised in a new filereader that will use TPL (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/parallel-programming/task-parallel-library-tpl)
  - The UI will be optimized, Buttons will Autosize to the Text
  - More Translations (mostly DEEPL or if one of you likes to translate ;) )
  Thanks to all the support and continuous reporting and making LogExpert better
