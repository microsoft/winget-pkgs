ShortDescription: Fast, small, and fully autonomous AI assistant framework — deploy anywhere, swap anything 🦀
Description: |-
  ZeroClaw is the runtime framework for agentic workflows — infrastructure that abstracts models, tools, memory, and execution so agents can be built once and run anywhere.
  ✨ Features
  - 🏎️ Lean Runtime by Default: Common CLI and status workflows run in a few-megabyte memory envelope on release builds.
  - 💰 Cost-Efficient Deployment: Designed for low-cost boards and small cloud instances without heavyweight runtime dependencies.
  - ⚡ Fast Cold Starts: Single-binary Rust runtime keeps command and daemon startup near-instant for daily operations.
  - 🌍 Portable Architecture: One binary-first workflow across ARM, x86, and RISC-V with swappable providers/channels/tools.
  - 🔍 Research Phase: Proactive information gathering through tools before response generation — reduces hallucinations by fact-checking first.
  Why teams pick ZeroClaw
  - Lean by default: small Rust binary, fast startup, low memory footprint.
  - Secure by design: pairing, strict sandboxing, explicit allowlists, workspace scoping.
  - Fully swappable: core systems are traits (providers, channels, tools, memory, tunnels).
  - No lock-in: OpenAI-compatible provider support + pluggable custom endpoints.
