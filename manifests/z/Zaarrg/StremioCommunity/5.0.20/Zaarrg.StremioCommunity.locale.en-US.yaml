  📦 Installation
  1. Using the Installer: Download Stremio-5.0.20-x64.exe and run it.
  > ⏳ Note: Preferably use x64 as this improves player limits especially on high end system. Only use x86 if u are sure what u are doing.
  2. Using the Portable-Archive: Download Stremio-5.0.20-x64.7z extract it and run stremio.exe
  > ⏳ Note: This build is fully portable and includes WebView2 - First start takes ~20 Seconds as portable browser has to be setup as well.
  🚀 Changelog
  - Added Support for custom WebMods. This allows loading custom js or css on startup of the app.
  - With the new WebMods feature added a custom working version of the Stremio Glass theme by @Fxy6969 is added to this release.
  > ⏳ Note: For the Stremio Glass theme to work use the attached version in this release as it has fixes to work properly with this stremio community version as the original theme was made for a electron fork using the web player of stremio.

  Uninstall Theme
  Uninstall Theme by deleting the liquid-glass-theme folder inside the portable_config/webmods folder.
  > ⚠️ Note: This theme may have UI-breaking bugs. I’ve patched the obvious issues, but the original targets an Electron fork, so it isn’t fully compatible with the community Stremio app as this app is based on the offical Stremio app (WebView2).
