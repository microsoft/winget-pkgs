  Changelog
  GUI and Functionality
  - Fixed a bug that would make using certain keys such as Enter, Backspace,
    or quotes in code editors in the Assets Manager unusable (#5797).
  - Added Kazakh language (#5771).
  - Improve fenced code block language detection when using fenced code
    attributes. Now, using the recommended Pandoc-style syntax for attribute
    strings will correctly match the language in the info string to one of the
    available identifiers.
