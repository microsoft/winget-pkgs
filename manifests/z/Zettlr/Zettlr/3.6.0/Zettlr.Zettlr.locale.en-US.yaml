  a11y/Dark Mode fixes | Text Transformations | Bug Fixes and Performance Improvements
  We are happy to present a new update to Zettlr that includes a few nifty new features! Most notably, this update introduces a series of text transformations that you can use to modify any text inside Zettlr. These transformations allow you to, e.g., capitalize text to sentence or title case, fix errors that often happen when copying from PDF files, or change the text to conform to certain typographical styles. More transformations are to come in the future, but we believe that this is a great start to improve your workflow.
  A second section in which we were active for this release concerns the theme. First, we have fixed an annoying bug that would never remember your dark mode setting on platforms other than macOS. And second, we have fixed an accessibility issue that would make Zettlr flicker white whenever opening a new window while using dark mode.
  Finally, this update includes some additional bug fixes and performance improvements, and updates to the framework. For all information, as always, please refer to the complete changelog below.

  Text Transformations
  Zettlr now features a set of several text transformation commands in the editor.
  Using these commands, you can transform various pieces of text in the editor
  using several strategies aimed at working with both regular text (which you can,
  e.g., transform between sentence or title case) and corrupted text (from which
  you can remove control characters, unnecessary line breaks, and clean up
  quotation marks). In total, Zettlr now ships with 13 such transform commands,
  but many more are possible.
  To utilize these transformations, simply select the text you wish to transform,
  open the context menu on it, and select the corresponding transformation from
  the context menu.
  The available transforms as of now are:
  - Zap gremlins: Removes unwanted control characters (such as form feeds,
    vertical tabs, and others), which sometimes end up in recognized PDF text.
  - Strip duplicate spaces: Removes any superfluous spaces.
  - Italics to quotes: Turns italic markers (e.g., *text*) into quotes
    ("text").
  - Quotes to italics: Turns quotation marks (e.g., "text") into italic
    markers (*text*).
  - Remove line breaks: Removes superfluous linebreaks while retaining any
    paragraphs (separated by two consecutive linebreaks).
  - Straighten quotes: Turns smart, or "magic quotes" into regular quotes.
  - Ensure double quotes: Turns any type of quotation (which includes backticks,
    since those sometimes appear in text copied from PDF files!) into regular
    double quotes.
  - Double quotes to single: Turns any straight double quotes to single quotes.
  - Single quotes to double: Turns single quotes into double quotes.
  - Emdash — Add spaces around: Ensures that all em-dashes (—) in the text are
    surrounded by spaces.
  - Emdash — Remove spaces around: Ensures that no em-dashes (—) in the text
    are surrounded by spaces.
  - To sentence case: Turns the selected text to sentence case.
  - To title case: Turns The Selected Text To Title Case.
  GUI and Functionality
  - Feature: Zettlr now has text transformations. With these, you can change
    selected pieces of text using a quick access command menu (#5701). Special
    thanks to @richdouglasevans for implementing this.
  - Change: Zettlr will no longer parse Markdown-like files that exceed ca.
    10 MB in size. After some testing, we have determined that 10 MB seems to be
    a balanced trade-off between parsing as many files as possible and preventing
    the app to crash (especially on slower computers). Note that this only affects
    the caching of certain pieces of metadata, such as title, heading level 1, and
    ID. You will still be able to open and edit the file. For more context, see
    issue #5801.
  - Fixed a bug that would prevent the creation of new directories via the
    shortcut (#5769).
  - Fixed a bug that prevented retention of user-determined dark-mode setting on
    platforms other than macOS during application restarts (#570).
  - Fixed the list of related files disappearing when switching sidebar tabs
    (#5795).
  - Windows will now receive black as their background color on Windows and Linux
    if dark mode is active, preventing white flicker during window opening before
    the UI is ready (#5809).
  Under the Hood
  - Bump Pandoc to version 3.7.0.2.
  - Bump Electron to version 37.2.0.
  - The primary app service container can now be retrieved using the factory
    method getAppServiceContainer. This makes it possible to reduce a few
    recursive dependencies on passing the service container down and will help
    disentangle the main process services in the future.
