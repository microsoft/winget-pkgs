ReleaseNotes: |-
  Quality of Life Update
  This update is the second one in our roadmap to exchange Zettlr's code signing certificate, meaning that it doesn't contain all that much new functionality. Instead, it is relevant mostly to Windows users. Please try to install this update. If it doesn't work, read on for a link to the one-week old 3.4.2 release. Thanks for bearing with us!
  Do you enjoy Zettlr? Consider donating to help us pay for the development costs. You can donate monthly on Patreon or once via PayPal. Additionally, you can sponsor Hendrik Erz on GitHub or send a tip on Ko-Fi. Thanks for your support!

  An Important Note for Windows Users
  If you use Zettlr on Windows, there is a chance that you will be unable to
  install this update at first. This is because this update uses a different, new
  code signing certificate. There is a possibility that especially those of you
  who use a work computer on which you do not have administrative access, Windows
  will warn you of this update and prevent you from installing it. Based on
  initial communication, there are indications that this won't happen, but we
  wanted to let you know just in case.
  If you are unable to install this update, please make sure you update to at
  least version 3.4.2, which has been released last week. If you did not update to
  version 3.4.2, you can find do so
  by clicking this link.
  For more context, please read our blog post
  that outlines our roadmap for the code signing certificate change, as well as
  our Community Forum post.
  If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask them
  on the Community Forum,
  on Discord, or
  as a comment on our BlueSky or
  Mastodon accounts.
  If you are able to install this update without issues, please let us know on our Discord channel, Community Forum, or on BlueSky or Mastodon.
