  Quality of Life Update | Zettelkasten Link Improvements
  This update contains many smaller fixes and improvements of the app. The primary changes are a complete update of the various dependencies so that the app is up-to-date, including the most recent Electron framework and the most recent Pandoc. It also contains a few fixes for exports and translation improvements. Refer to the changelog below for a full list of changes.
  Note that we have updated the build pipeline to Ubuntu 22.04, which means that any older Ubuntu-system likely won't be able to run this version of Zettlr.
  Changelog
  GUI and Functionality
  - Change: The exporter will now forcefully enable (= if it is not yet
    enabled in the corresponding defaults file in the assets manager) the Pandoc
    extension wikilinks_title_after_pipe or wikilinks_title_before_pipe
    (depending on your settings) for every export from a supported (Markdown-
    based) reader so that wikilinks/Zettelkasten links are properly parsed.
  - Identification of Pandoc readers and writers is now more stable, resulting in
    clearer information across the app.
  - Fix the wikilink/Zettelkasten link Lua filter (#5605).
  - Zettlr now properly retrieves attachments also for items residing in group
    libraries (#5647).
  - Updated translations:
    - German (de-DE)
    - French (fr-FR, #5688)
    - Taiwanese (zh-TW, #5656)
  Under the Hood
  - Import Pandoc reader/writer parser from
    nathanlesage/pandoc-profile-generator; retire getPlainPandocReaderWriter.
  - Move pandoc-maps.ts to common pandoc-util location.
  - Add additional classes to Table of Contents-headings in the sidebar to allow
    targeting them with Custom CSS rules (toc-heading-X where X is the level).
  - Bump Electron to v35.1.5.
  - Bump Pandoc to v3.6.4
  - Bump Node.js across the CI to v22 (LTS).
  - Bump various other dependencies.
  - Upgrade the Ubuntu runners on the CI back to Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (#5172).
