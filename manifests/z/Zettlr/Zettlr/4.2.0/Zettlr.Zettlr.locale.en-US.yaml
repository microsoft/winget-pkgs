  Preview Mode Updates | Bug Fixes | Quality of Life Improvements
  This update brings three distinct sets of improvements. First, it contains a series of new features for the preview mode, which make blockquotes now render with a vertical bar instead of italicized font. In addition, Pandoc divs and spans are now pre-rendered and apply any custom styling you have applied, if applicable.
  Second, it contains a bunch of minor bug fixes and improvements of some annoying behavior so that the app works better for everyone. This also includes some big improvements of the Brazilian, Japanese, and German translations.
  Last but not least, this update includes a fix for a bug that had been introduced by the recent Zotero 8 update. Some users were reporting that, after that update, Zettlr would stop suggesting citations, and that other parts of the citation pipeline would randomly fail. This update provides a fix to ensure that your citations should mostly work, even if the output from Zotero contains some minor problems.

  Changelog
  GUI and Functionality
  - Feature: New utilities for working with native Pandoc Divs and spans
    (#6032):
    - Added a new setting to switch between native highlights (==mark==) and
      using spans for this ([mark]{.highlight}).
    - Added a new toolbar button to insert divs and spans.
    - Added new buttons to the formatting toolbar to insert underlined,
      strikethrough, and highlighted spans.
  - Feature: Blockquotes are now rendered with a vertical bar (#6122).
  - Feature: Users can now opt to display hidden files and folders
    ("dot-files") in the sidebar and/or filemanager in the settings (#6041).
  - Feature: Custom Pandoc divs are now pre-rendered depending on the
    corresponding setting (#6121). This allows you to preview any custom styling
    you have applied to them within the editor.
  - Feature: You can now move document tabs to the start or end of the
    tablist from the context menu (#6130).
  - Added an error message that explains to users that an import profile is needed
    if they attempt to import a supported file with no profile.
  - Updated pt-BR translation (#6154).
  - Updated ja-JP translation (#6198).
  - Updated de-DE translation.
  - Improved the tag recognition to allow for more varied Unicode characters in
    tags than previously, including umlauts, accents, or emojis (#6155).
  - Improved pilcrow styling when whitespace rendering is on (#6152).
  - Fixed the frontmatter linter never reporting any errors with the YAML (#6167).
  - Fixed an issue where images that spanned multiple lines could cause the editor
    to crash when image rendering was active.
  - Fixed the tab key not respecting the "Indent using tabs instead of spaces"
    setting. Additionally, pressing tab now always inserts spaces in YAML
    frontmatter blocks to maintain valid YAML syntax (#6168).
  - Fix: The formatting toolbar no longer grabs focus from the editor.
  - Fix: Added a configuration setting to allow restoring the pre-4.0 behavior of
    not showing the underlying Markdown syntax of pre-rendered elements when the
    cursor merely touches the element. If the setting "Show Markdown syntax when
    the cursor is adjacent or inside an element" is enabled (the default), the
    editor will show the Markdown syntax both when the cursor is within the
    element or if it is adjacent to it.
  - Fixed the table editor "Delete table" context menu item not working as
    intended (#6088).
  - Updated MathJax URL in various HTML-based templates to v4 (#6148). Note that
    Zettlr will not overwrite existing templates, so to benefit from this, you
    will have to factory-reset the affected templates.
  - Fixed a bug starting with the Zotero 8 update in Zettlr would no longer
    provide autocomplete for some users. The reason is that some of the items in
    the exported CSL JSON files would lack an ID property (that is, the citekey),
    while Zettlr assumed each item would have an ID.
  Under the Hood
  - Increased config retrieval speed in the renderers (#6140). This can speed up
    some UI interactions.
