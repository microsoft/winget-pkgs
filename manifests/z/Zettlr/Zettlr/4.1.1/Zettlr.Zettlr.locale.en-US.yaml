  Changelog
  GUI and Functionality
  - Fix a bug where the preferences window would allow arbitrary tab sizes. Now,
    tab sizes are bound between 2 and 10 (see #6131).
  - Fixed links not registering clicks when they are pre-rendered within table
    cells of the TableEditor (#4557).
  - Fix application of custom tag classes.
  - Fixed a bug that would not correctly apply the code class to segments of
    code in some circumstances (primarily when adding YAML front matters or
    comments).
  - Fix syntax highlighting in code blocks, frontmatters, etc. Now, Zettlr assigns
    more default-colors of the solarized code syntax theme. In addition, regular
    text is now more readable, especially in light mode.
  - Fixes and improvements to the toolbar styling; simplify CSS rules.
  - Made toolbar icons slightly larger.
  - Update ja-JP translation (#6132).
  - Fixed a bug that would not accept custom height constraints via Pandoc
    attributes for images if the maximum image height was set to 100% in the
    settings.
  - Fixed "Learn more" link on the citation page in the onboarding window (#6138).
  - Fixed an issue that would make the file search crash on Windows, if a
    workspace was located at a volume root (#6142).
  - Fixed an issue that would cause Mermaid graphs to still be pre-rendered in
    "raw" mode (#6141).
  - Fixed a bug that would cause code files (JSON/YAML/TeX) to be formatted
    weirdly if Zettlr opens with one of these files on startup, due to relevant
    CSS never being loaded in this case.
  - Improved PDF viewer interaction (#6153).
  Under the Hood
  - Update dependencies:
    - Electron: v40.0
    - Forge: 7.11.1
    - Builder: 26.5.0
  - The FSAL Cache now consistently utilizes asynchronous filesystem operations
    (#5994).
  - Refactor Zettelkasten link and tag parsing (#5997).
  - Number controls in forms now allow for providing min and max values.
  - Increased strictness of the @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any rule from
    "off" (no checking) to "warn" to slowly start migrating away from any
    remaining any uses in the wild.
  - FSAL Improvements:
    - Removed a lot of dead code in the FSAL.
    - Moved the save functionality away from the FSAL*-submodules, and divided
      the responsibility between the DocumentsProvider and the FSAL module.
