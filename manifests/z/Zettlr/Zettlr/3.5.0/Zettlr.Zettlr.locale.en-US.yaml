  Bug Fixes and Performance Improvements | Keyboard Shortcuts
  Over the past weeks, we have managed to include a few improvements left and right, which mostly involve bug fixes and minor tweaks. More notably, we have performed some work on the keyboard shortcut situation. First, we have unified and harmonized the keyboard shortcuts available to you by using the same keymap across all editors that you can see across the app (including in the assets manager), which hopefully reduces friction for those who frequently adapt profiles or snippets. We have also added a few new keyboard shortcuts and fixed a few conflicts. Other than that, we are happy to report that, thanks to community efforts, the French and Czech translations have been updated.

  Changelog
  GUI and Functionality
  - Feature: The code editors (in the assets manager and elsewhere) now share
    the same keymap as the main editor.
  - Feature: The image renderer now acknowledges and respects the presence of
    a Pandoc link attributes string behind an image to scale images using custom
    sizes (#1328).
  - Change: Removed some optional properties from the default profiles. If you
    want to switch to the new defaults, delete those files from the assets manager
    or rename your existing ones. Specifically, removed top-level-division,
    whose meaning has changed which started to produce empty first pages during
    Word exports (#5645).
  - Fixed a long-standing bug that would not clear the modification marker on both
    file tabs (#5747) and the macOS window indicator (#4724) when a modified file
    was closed without saving changes. Acknowledges PR #5747 which is superseded
    by this change.
  - Added a keyboard shortcut for highlighting text: Ctrl-Shift-H (#4668).
  - The Mermaid diagram renderer is now more flexible. It now renders any Mermaid
    diagram in any type of valid fenced code block with both allowed variations of
    providing the info string: the plain mermaid and the Pandoc-attribute style
    {.mermaid} class (#5734).
  - Fixed a keymap conflict that would cause Enter to not accept autocomplete
    suggestions in some contexts such as Markdown syntax elements (#5646).
  - Improved the math, mermaid, image, and heading renderers so that they perform
    additional checks before actually updating their respective rendered elements.
    This should reduce the amount of flickering and unintentional scrolling
    especially in longer documents with many of such elements.
  - Enable the CodeMirror folding keymap which lets you fold and unfold code, such
    as headings, with keyboard shortcuts instead of using the arrows to the left
    of the editor (#857). The shortcuts are: Ctrl-Shift-[ (Windows/Linux) or
    Cmd-Alt-[ (macOS) for folding code, Ctrl-Shift-] or Cmd-Alt-] for
    unfolding, Ctrl-Alt-[ for folding all, and Ctrl-Alt-] for unfolding all.
  - Update fr-FR translation (#5738).
  - Update cs-CZ translation (#5775).
  Under the Hood
  - Cache ESLint results to improve subsequent linter run speed (#5706).
  - Spawn shell when starting test GUI on Windows (#5685).
  - Markdown commands now check whether the provided target EditorView is parsed
    using a Markdown parser before running.
  - Move all keymaps into a single defaultKeymap.
  - Assume ** as default bold and * as default italic formatting for Markdown
    commands if the config field is not present.
  - Added a pandocLinkParser for properly parsing pandoc link attribute strings.
