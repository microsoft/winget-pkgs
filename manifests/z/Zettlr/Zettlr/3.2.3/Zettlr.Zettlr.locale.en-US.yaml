ReleaseNotes: |-
  Visual fixes | Better updates | Crash fixes
  This update fixes issues across several areas of the app. Primarily, we have improved the rendering of elements in the editor, the usability of drag & drop and paste operations, the updater, and a few rare but severe bugs. More specifically, the image renderer is now more usable, and works and looks better. Also, we have improved some rendering issues with regard to blockquotes and highlights. Thirdly, the updater now provides both better feedback and checks once an hour, meaning that the app will notify you of new updates even if you rarely restart it. Also, it will notify you of an available update with a message box, rather than just the update icon in the toolbar. Lastly, users have reported and we have found a few issues that could freeze up individual editors, or the entire app, leading to a suboptimal experience. As always, for all changes, please consult the changelog below.
