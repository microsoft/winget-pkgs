  **Fix Images and Links on Windows**

  Some days are just bad days, and today was one such for us: In version 3.3.0, we accidentally
  broke all images, links, and file previews for Windows users. This patch fixes this. Sorry for
  the inconvenience! Have a great day, now with an actually working update to your favorite writing
  app!

  # Changelog

  ## GUI and Functionality

    which included images, linked files, attachments, and others (#5489)
