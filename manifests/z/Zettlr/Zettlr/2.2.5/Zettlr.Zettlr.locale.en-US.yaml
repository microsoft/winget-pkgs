ReleaseNotes: |-
  GUI and Functionality
  • Localized Previous/next file menu items
  • Fixed selection of words on right-click in the editor
  • Editor word selection on right-click now accepts both ' and ’
  • Add Fortran syntax highlighting (keyword fortran)
  • Fix a bug that could lead to data loss when changing documents while a table has focus
  • Added an extra check so that unexpected values of openDirectory would not prevent Zettlr from starting
  • Make the vim command line visible and style it according to the Zettlr themes
  • Clicking on the toolbar now doesn't steal the focus from other elements, making it more comfortable to drag the window and immediately continue writing
  • Added slight transparency to the inline code background color so that block cursors are visible inside that code
  • Resizing an image upon pasting from clipboard now works better, since the aspect ratio will only be recalculated once you leave the input field (i.e. by tabbing into another input); this way you can just type in a specific number
  • Disabling "render task lists" will now also disable the application of task lists; this helps speed up editing long documents with many tasks
  • The main editor search now no longer automatically searches
  • When opening the main editor search, anything in the search input will now be selected
  • Fix unintended global search start
  • Highlight results from global search in the main editor text
  • The code editor in the assets manager now scales with the size of the window
  • Added an option to prevent Zettlr from checking for updated translations

  Under the Hood
  • Switched to the new code signing certificate for the windows installers
  • Write errors which are logged properly to disk
  • Display errors in the log viewer
  • Added the default Homebrew installation directory for Apple Silicon Macs in order for Zettlr to find Pandoc installed via brew.
  • Improve global search typings
