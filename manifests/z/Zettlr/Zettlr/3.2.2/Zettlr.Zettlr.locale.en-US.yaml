  Changelog
  Changes to Pandoc Profiles
  This update fixes a workaround that Zettlr had in place for a shortcoming of Pandoc regarding the automatic numbering of headings. This workaround is no longer necessary, since Pandoc has since fixed the issue.
  Zettlr now ships with changed default profiles for various export formats. Since Zettlr never overwrites any data, the new defaults will not be applied automatically. You can apply the change manually by removing the following line from the default profiles: shift-heading-level-by: 1.
  GUI and Functionality
  - change: Remove shift-heading-level-by: 1 line from default profiles
  - Fixed the "Paste as Plain" menu item not working (#5052)
  - Dark mode folded header's ellipsis are now properly colored (#5284)
  - Add Pascal syntax highlighting (keyword: pascal; #5368)

  - Fixed the tag search from the tag cloud popover (#5124)
  - Fixed visual artifacts in the backgrounds for code blocks and comments (#5260)
  - Fixed a bug that would apply certain shortcuts to all open editor panes, rather than the last focused one (#5282)

  Under the Hood

  - Bumped ESLint and dependencies
  - Fixed HTML DOM structure in a few places where they would violate the spec
