  Bug Fixes | Performance Improvements
  This is the first minor update for Zettlr 4.0. It comes with many fixes and small improvements, but also two new features and a change that you should know about. The two features are that you can now additionally collapse YAML frontmatters and Pandoc divs with the collapse-arrows left of the editor area, and Zettlr furthermore remembers which sections you have collapsed on a per-editor basis.
  The change pertains to a configuration update that will make downgrading from this version difficult, and which requires your attention. Read everything in the Changelog below.
  Changelog
  Read Before Updating
  In this version, we perform a long-planned configuration change that affects
  your loaded workspaces and files. Before installing this update, please take
  note of which workspaces and files you have open, in case they are being closed
  through this update. (No data will be actually deleted, but this helps you avoid
  having to search for the folders.)
  In addition, it is crucial to remember that once you update to this version,
  there is no turning back. If you decide to downgrade to a previous version,
  your files and workspaces will be closed, and you will have to re-open them
  afterwards.
  GUI and Functionality
  - Feature: You can now collapse YAML frontmatters and Pandoc divs (#6115).
  - Feature: Zettlr now remembers folded regions as long as the window remains
    open, even when you close a document (#6115).
  - Change: Due to a configuration change, downgrading Zettlr (which we
    generally discourage) after updating to this version will lead to your
    workspaces being closed.
  - Fixed XCode Command Line Tools setup dialog on macOS (#5428).
  - Fixed an issue that prevented opening Markdown files with tables that include
    Pandoc attribute strings when the TableEditor was enabled (#6110).
  - Fixed footnote tooltip rendering (#6107).
  - Fixed an issue preventing Zettlr from starting if the stats file contained
    errors (#6127).
  - Improved link target extraction logic when following links (#6098).
  - Performance improvements when following links (#6072).
  - Hide reference link labels when previewing Markdown links (#6097).
  - Improved performance on generating the preview-bibliography in the sidebar by
    collecting citation keys from the document only in the main process (#6068).
  - Improved math parsing to fix certain cases (#6030).
  - Relaxed filename restrictions for loading custom dictionaries (#6126).
  - Improved Pandoc div parsing (#6120).
  - Update de-DE translation (#6081).
  - Update ja-JP translation (#6086).
  Under the Hood
  - Moved the openPaths property. The openPaths property was a simple array
    holding all currently loaded root files and workspaces intermingled. This
    setting stems from the time when Zettlr could not load arbitrary files, and
    mixing files and folders is generally a bad practice. This property has now
    been moved into the new namespace app in the settings, and divided into
    openFiles and openWorkspaces. This will make a few future checks and
    features easier to implement, as the separation into files and folders is made
    explicit and not left to the OS. This will allow us to better clean up the
    property (personal note: I've seen a colleague's config file which was full of
    non-existing file paths, and I didn't like that). In rare situations, this
    change may close all your workspaces, in which case you would have to re-open
    them.
  - New utility function disambiguateFile that can be used to retrieve a
    time-based non-existing path that can be used for backup purposes.
  - Added a new environment variable, ZETTLR_DISABLE_UPDATE_CHECK. If that
    variable is detected during build, this will hard-disable update checks in the
    application. This can be used by package maintainers to ensure update checks
    from within the app are disabled, and Zettlr instead must be updated via the
    package manager. Please note that the build script will only check for the
    presence of the variable, not its contents. To ensure you are building with
    updates enabled, you need to ensure the variable is not set, for example by
    running unset ZETTLR_DISABLE_UPDATE_CHECK before commencing the build. For
    more information, please see issue #6075. When this environment variable is
    present during build, the resulting binary will exhibit this behavior:
    - The "Check for updates" menu item will not be present.
    - The "Updates" and "Beta releases" preferences will not be present. Instead,
      the updates-setting will be replaced by an informative message informing
      that updates have been disabled for the app.
    - The update check itself in the update provider will never run.
    - Zettlr will include an environment variable indicating whether updates are
      disabled (1) or enabled (0) that is visible within the debug panel.
  - Added a new environment variable, BUNDLE_PANDOC. If this variable is set to
    a value of 0, this will prevent the build script from downloading and
    bundling Pandoc during the build stage. This can be used by package
    maintainers to reduce the package size when there is a better way to provide
    Pandoc (e.g., by listing it as a dependency for Zettlr). This also means that
    the build environment does not require the dependencies that are specifically
    for the download script.
  - fix: The Pandoc Attribute parser does not throw an error on malformed
    attribute strings anymore, and instead just returns an empty record (#6110).
