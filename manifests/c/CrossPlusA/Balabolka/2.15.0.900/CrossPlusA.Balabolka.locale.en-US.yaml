ShortDescription: A Text-To-Speech (TTS) program
Description: |-
  Balabolka is a Text-To-Speech (TTS) program. All computer voices installed on your system are available to Balabolka. The on-screen text can be saved as an audio file. The program can read the clipboard content, extract text from documents, customize font and background colour, control reading from the system tray or by the global hotkeys. Balabolka supports text file formats: AZW, AZW3, CHM, DjVu, DOC, DOCX, EML, EPUB, FB2, FB3, HTML, LIT, MD, MOBI, ODP, ODS, ODT, PDB, PRC, PDF, PPT, PPTX, RTF, TCR, WPD, XLS, XLSX.
  The program uses various versions of Microsoft Speech API (SAPI); it allows to alter a voice's parameters, including rate and pitch. The user can apply a special substitution list to improve the quality of the voice's articulation. This feature is useful when you want to change the spelling of words. The rules for the pronunciation correction use the syntax of regular expressions.
  Balabolka can save the synchronized text in external LRC files or in MP3 tags inside the audio files. When an audio file is played with players on a computer or on modern digital audio players, the text is displayed synchronously (at the same way, as lyrics for songs).

ReleaseNotes: |-
  [-] Fixed the using of ElevenLabs Text-To-Speech.
  [-] Fixed the applying of bookmarks.
  [-] Fixed pauses between sentences and paragraphs on Windows 7.
  [*] Updated the settings for "Timer".
  [*] Resources for Bulgarian, Italian, Korean and Uzbek languages were updated (thanks to Kostadin Kolev, Massimo Castiglia, Kim Young-Gam and Ulugbek Tolakov).
  [-] Judging by the tests, Microsoft developers fixed a bug in the MMDevApi.dll system library: after installing the KB5060829 update for Windows 11 24H2, the library functions work without an error. But I can't bring back the use of the MMDevApi.dll library in my application yet, as I have to wait until the update will be installed on most computers with Windows 11.
