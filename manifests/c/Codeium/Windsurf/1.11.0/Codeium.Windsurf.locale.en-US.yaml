ReleaseNotes: |-
  Speak to Cascade

  Voice
  - Users can now speak into the chat rather than having to type things out.

  @-mentioning conversations
  - @-mention the first conversation so Cascade has full context of it as it goes to write tests for you.

  Deeper Browser integration
  - Chat with Cascade about tabs that are open in the Browser using @-mentions

  JetBrains improvements
  - Planning Mode, Workflows, and file-based Rules are now available for Cascade on JetBrains

  Improvements
  - Now you can @-mention terminal in Cascade.
  - You can turn on the Auto-Continue setting to have Cascade automatically continue its response if it hits a limit.
  - Support for more MCP servers with easier and more secure authentication by integrating the new Streamable HTTP transport (replaces SSE) and MCP authentication (replaces access tokens or API keys in the config).
  - Important for enterprise customers who use Windsurf across lots of repos. Now, you can enforce ignore rules across all repositories by placing .codeiumignore in the ~/.codeium/ folder
