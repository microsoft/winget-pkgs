ReleaseNotes: |-
  GPT-5.2
  GPT-5.2 is now available in Windsurf. This model will be available for 0x credits in Windsurf (to paid users) for a limited time.
  GPT-5.2 represents the biggest leap for GPT models in agentic coding since GPT-5 and is a SOTA coding model in its price range. The version bump undersells the jump in intelligence. We`re excited to make it the default across Windsurf and several core Devin workloads. - Jeff Wang, CEO of Windsurf
