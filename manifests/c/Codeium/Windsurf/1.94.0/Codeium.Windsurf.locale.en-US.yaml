  Cascade Memories, Web Search and Docs

  Web and Docs Search
  - Cascade can now search the web! There are a couple of ways to use this:
    - Automatically: Simply ask a query that needs a live internet search and Cascade will trigger web search automatically.
    - URL Input: Paste in a URL and Cascade will use your URL as context (works well with blog posts, docs, articles, public GitHub files, etc.).
    - @web: If you prefer to explicitly ask Cascade to search the web, use the @web command.
    - @docs: Cascade can search through some popular documentation sites, including Windsurf's own help docs!
  - Web tools like search and URL reading can be enabled and disabled via the Windsurf Settings panel in the bottom right of your status bar.
  - A web search is 1 flow action credit and the resulting URL page reads are additional credits.

  Cascade Auto-Generated Memories
  - Cascade can now automatically generate memories to retain context between conversations
  - You can prompt Cascade to create a memory at any time if you want it to remember key context
  - Memories are visible in the Memories Panel, which is accessible when Cascade makes a memory or through the command palette
  - Memories can be deleted from the Memories Panel
  - Memories do not cost any flow action credits to generate

  - Fixed a bug where pressing Ctrl/Cmd + z after a diff hunk rejection would undo editor changes made immediately before the rejection

  - Fixed a bug where in-editor diff decorations would not be correctly synced with Cascade after reverting to a past step
  - Fixed a bug where renaming, moving, or deleting a file with an active Cascade diff would cause the changes overview popover to freeze on subsequent steps
  - SSH Agent forwarding for Dev Containers on Mac and Linux
  - Fixed bugs in Cascade's find tool, hopefully reducing errors in Cascade tool usage
  - Performance improvements with Cascade and better visibility into errors
  - Overall improvements to how Cascade will respect Rules and Auto-Generated Memories
  - Fixed a rare bug where Reject All button in changes overview popover would revert all changes but not dispose of diff zones
