ReleaseNotes: |-
  Wave 14: Arena Mode
  Arena Mode brings side-by-side model comparison directly into your IDE, plus Plan Mode for smarter task planning.

  Arena Mode
  Run two Cascade agents side-by-side with hidden model identities and vote on which performs better. Arena Mode lets you discover which models actually work best for your workflow, codebase, and tasks—not just what benchmarks or influencers say.
  - Battle Groups: Choose specific models to compare or let Windsurf randomly select from curated groups like "fast models" vs "smart models"
  - Personal & Global Leaderboards: Your votes contribute to both a personal leaderboard (your preferences) and a global one (across all Windsurf users)
  - Sync or Branch: Send followup prompts to both agents simultaneously, or branch and explore different paths individually
  To get started, select the new Arena tab in the model picker. All battle groups are free for the first week for paid users.

  Plan Mode
  Plan Mode is a new Cascade mode alongside Code and Ask. Use it to create detailed implementation plans before diving into code.
  Pro tip: Type megaplan in the Cascade input box to trigger an advanced form that asks clarifying questions to create a more aligned, comprehensive plan.
