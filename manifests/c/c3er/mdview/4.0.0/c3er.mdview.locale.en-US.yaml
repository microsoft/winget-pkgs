ShortDescription: Standalone Markdown Viewer
Description: >
  A standalone application that renders and displays Markdown files. It does nothing else! No direct
  editing nor any fancy note taking features. It is not distributed as a browser extension nor does
  it fire up a web server - so no web browser is needed to see the rendered Markdown file.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  ## Unblocked content can now be remembered (issue #61)

  It is now possible, to unblock images permanently, meaning that media doesn't need to be unblocked
  again after restarting the application.

  ## Single window position, independent of the document (issue #67)

  The application settings have now an option for remembering the window position:

  - "Remember for each document" (default, as previous versions): Remembers the window position for
    each document
  - "Remember single position": The application opens the window always at the last previously opened
    position, independently of the opened document

  ## Bugfixes

  ### Issue #62

  HTML anchors can now be defined also via name, additionally to the already supported id attribute.
