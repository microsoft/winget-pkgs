ReleaseNotes: |-
  What's New? - 1.80.19
  - [New] ZZZ Pre-download Support, by @neon-nyan
  - [New] Bilibili Region Support for ZZZ, by @bagusnl & @neon-nyan
  However, this change is happening at the back-end and Bilibili region might not be available for stable at the moment as it needs some testing to be done on our end first. You can change your channel release to Preview in order to bring a support for ZZZ Bilibili client.
  - [Imp] Bring back the old file download behavior to store chunk files as sequential .001 files, by @neon-nyan
  This change however, is backward compatible if you still have the hash-based (.xxxxx) extension chunks.
  - [Fix] Random "File is being used by another process" Errors when Downloading, by @neon-nyan
  - [Fix] Potentially skipping HDiff patching and old files removal routine while applying ZZZ Update, by @neon-nyan
  - [Fix] Hi3Helper.Http submodule causing size miscalculation while downloading files, by @neon-nyan
