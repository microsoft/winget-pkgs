  Collapse 1.80.9: New Eridu
  Greetings fellow HoYo-games enjoyers, here comes another release of Collapse! (This time with more spice and flavor than ever!)We keep saying this with every release, but this release is somehow even bigger than the previous ones. Thank you guys for your tremendous support, without it, we wouldn't be where we are today.Collapse started as a hobby, a passion project of some sorts for us, back in 2021, in the hopes that we could improve the player and user experience of the traditional launcher. Fast-forward almost 3 years, and we've managed to develop this application into something that hundreds (if not thousands) of people use on a daily basis to play their favorite games.This launcher will continue to evolve and improve, and we're proud to be able to give you another version with plenty of new features, fixes and improvements over the existing HoYoverse launchers.Thank you again for sticking with our project throughout the last couple of years!For faster releases and more experimental features, consider switching to the Preview branch in the App Settings.
  What's New?

  Improvement: New UI Design Language
  Well, let's not beat around the bush. We have a new logo, graciously designed & animated by @neon-nyan. Our design philosophy was "Moon" this time around, and we hope you guys like it!With the introduction of the new logo, we've also improved the overall look and feel of the launcher by adding more transparency throughout our UI elements. You'll notice them most prominently in the following sections of the app:
  - Notification and Navigation Panel
  - Page Background Acrylic
  - Auto-close After Clearing All Notifications
  - Out-of-Box Experience, when you set up Collapse for the first time
  - Every time you start the launcher, unless you have "Use Intro Animation Sequence" disabled in the App Settings
  New Feature: Video Background Support
  Well, the title says it all! By popular demand, and after many months of hard work, we have finally added support for video files as a background.Currently supported formats are: MP4, MOV, MKV, WEBM, AVI and GIFThe feature works exactly the same as it would for still images, just with videos now!Please note that by-region background support will come at a later date.
  [!IMPORTANT]
  Due to the massive changes in the image handler, you may need to manually clear the image cache on Collapse.
  This can be done by going into Settings, and pressing the "Clear Image Files" button.

  Major Changes

  [!NOTE]
  .NET update includes CVE (Security Vulnerability CVE-2024-21409) fix
  Core System Improvements
  On top of all the bugfixes that come in this release (there are quite a lot), Collapse will now prevent your system from going to sleep when you are executing a core launcher task, such as:
  - Game installation process (download, extract)
  - Game update process (patching)
  - Game repair processes (cache and file repair functionality)
  Please note that your system will be able to go into Sleep (S0 or other) once the tasks are completed, automatically.Settings Improvements
