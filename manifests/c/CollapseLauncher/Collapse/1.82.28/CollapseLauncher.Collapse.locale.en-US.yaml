ReleaseNotes: |-
  > We've recently released a new launcher status tracker! Head on over to https://status.collapselauncher.com to see it!
  Servicing/Maintenance Mode Phase
  Version 1.82.17 onwards will mark the "Servicing/Maintenance Mode" part of our development cycle, meaning that 1.82.xxx releases will no longer get any improvements or new features, unless any urgent changes or bug fixes need to be pushed or backported from our Preview branch.
  We are going to plan other new features, improvements and changes to be pushed in later release, 1.83.xxx.
  Hit us on our Official Discord or Create an Issue if you have ideas what features or changes you want to have in later 1.83.xxx or future release.
