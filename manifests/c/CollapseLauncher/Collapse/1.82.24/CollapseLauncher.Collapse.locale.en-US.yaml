  > We have just published our new landing page, which you can view at https://collapselauncher.com !
  Servicing/Maintenance Mode Phase
  Version 1.82.17 onwards will mark as the 1.82.xxx releases enters "Servicing/Maintenance Mode", meaning that 1.82.xxx releases will no longer get any improvements or new features, unless any urgent changes or bug fixes that need to be pushed or backported.
  We are going to plan other new features, improvements and changes to be pushed in later release, 1.83.xxx.
