  - [Fix] [ZZZ GSP] Wrong index assigned to the resolution list and width rounding issue, by @neon-nyan
      - If the default resolution exist on the fullscreen resolution list, the index of that resolution will be shifted to the first index. Previously in Collapse, it was manually added to the top while it actually not deleted to the fullscreen list, making it duplicated. Now, it should matches the behaviour
      - Some resolution which have rounding digits might have displayed incorrectly.
