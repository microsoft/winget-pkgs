ReleaseNotes: -|
Hi, CryoTechnic here o/

It's been a bit since the last preview update. While we've been hard at work with Plugins and other cool things, we've had to release this update. This isn't something we wanted to do, but to preserve the safety of our users, it's what has to be done.

Due to a reported recent ban for using the Mobile Layout feature, we are disabling it for now by force. While the ban seems to be only applicable for co-op play and is currently limited to Genshin Impact, we're not taking a risk with it and are choosing to disable this feature until we are sure that it is safe to use for our users.

If you have similar issues with this feature and/or other features that are known to cause issues with account standing (whether it be a suspension or a ban), please contact us immediately.

If you are from HoYo, thank you, for doing this to your players, I'm sure that the cloud subscription you guys are offering (among other things but we won't be opening that can of worms today) is worth it!
