ReleaseNotes: |-
  Our community is pleased to announce Caddy 2.11! Of note are new features, numerous bug fixes including several security patches, and various QoL ("quality-of-life") enhancements.
  There are no code changes from v2.11.0 other than to a CI job. Due to a recent external change that broke our release process, the first release of 2.11 is v2.11.1.
  Special Sponsor Shoutout
  Extra big thanks to our major sponsors:
  - ZeroSSL
  - Stripe
  - Railway
  They, along with dozens of smaller sponsors, make this project and new releases possible, together with our maintainer team. Thank you all!
  Notable changes
  - Encrypted ClientHello (ECH) keys are rotated automatically.
  - Time-rolling options for logs.
  - SIGUSR1 can now reload configuration if it was initially loaded from a file on the command line and did not get changed via the API.
  - Reverse proxy now automatically rewrites the Host header to the address of the upstream when the upstream is HTTPS (#7454)
  - log_append can now log request and response bodies, useful for debugging.
  - Our project now implements and requires Assistance Disclosures (for AI/LLMs) on issues, PRs, comments, replies, reviews, etc.
  - Many, many other minor improvements and bug fixes.
  Thank you to everyone who was involved this release!
  ⚠️ Security patches
  - fastcgi: CVE-2026-27590 by @dunglas and @AbdrrahimDahmani - Unicode case-folding length expansion causes incorrect split_path index (SCRIPT_NAME/PATH_INFO confusion) in FastCGI transport.
  - admin: CVE-2026-27589 by @1seal - Cross-origin requests attempted with no-cors mode could cause some API requests to succeed; such requests are now blocked. (In order for this to be practically exploitable, a web browser executing a malicious web page must be running locally to a production Caddy process.)
  - caddyhttp: CVE-2026-27588 by Asim Viladi Oglu Manizada - The Host matcher becomes case-sensitive for large host lists (>100), enabling host-based route/auth bypass.
  - caddyhttp: CVE-2026-27587 by Asim Viladi Oglu Manizada - The Path matcher skips case normalization for escape sequences, enabling path-based route/auth bypass.
  - caddytls: CVE-2026-27586 by @moscowchill - TLS client authentication silently fails open when CA certificate file is missing or malformed.
  - caddyhttp: CVE-2026-27585 by @parrot409 - Improper sanitization of glob characters in file matcher may lead to bypassing security protections.
