ReleaseNotes: |-
  Happy New Year! We're pleased to release Caddy 2.9. Aside from some minor new features, this release is mainly focused on refinements and bug fixes in many areas, including:
  - Config loading
  - Events
  - Logging
  - Placeholders
  - Reverse proxy and HTTP server performance
  - Matchers
  - HTTP (esp. HTTP/3)
  - Metrics (per-host metrics)
  - Security
  - TLS automation & ACME ARI
  We realize there is extensive interest in Encrypted Client Hello (ECH) and post-quantum ciphers. These are slated to be supported in Go 1.24, which is scheduled for a stable release in approximately February. We did not want to force users to go through the inconvenience of installing pre-release, non-stock installations of Go, even though the RCs are quite stable and production-ready, in order to even compile Caddy, which is quite common given our plugin ecosystem. We anticipate a Caddy 2.10 release in the near future with these capabilities, built on Go 1.24.We hope you will enjoy the 2.9 release. Thanks to all contributors, bug reporters, and helpers, and those organizations which deployed pre-release versions to production to help verify patches and features.Changelog
