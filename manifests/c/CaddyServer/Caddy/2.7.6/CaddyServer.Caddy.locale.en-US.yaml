ReleaseNotes: |-
  In this version we've made several fixes and enhancements with help from several contributors. Most changes are small, but some notable ones:- The templates middleware is now officially extensible (experimentally). This means modules can add custom functions/actions for templates to execute.
  - TLS storage cleaning is now synchronized across the cluster and remembered across restarts. This should greatly lower costs for expensive storage backends like DynamoDB.
  - Placeholders are now evaluated in config for certificate loaders.
  - Numerous bug fixes.
