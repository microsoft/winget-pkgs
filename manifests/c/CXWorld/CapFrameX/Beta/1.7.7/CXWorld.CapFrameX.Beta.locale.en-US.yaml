ReleaseNotes: |-
  Update 2025/12/22
  - The PawnIO.sys driver conflict with third-party tools has been resolved. If you require a PawnIO installation for other applications, you may now install it. CapFrameX manages this component independently. Install latest .NET 9 runtime.
  - Reworked CPU thread management
  - Performance optimizations
  - Reworked IGCL support (Intel GPUs and iGPUs) with multi adapter handling
  - Fixed DIMM temperature sensors
  - Fixed bug on Comparison tab when using standard MsBetweenPresents metrics
  - Fixed bug when Drag&Drop captures in folder list
  - Added PC Latency for Nvidia graphics cards. Feature is still beta state, reports NaN in some cases.
  - Added voltage sensor for Nvidia GPUs
  - Added monitor refresh rate for Nvidia GPUs
  - Added D3D Dedicated GPU memory performance counter
  - Reworked overlay entry defaults
  - Added sorting overlay entries button
  - Reworked sensor sorting
  - Added selecting primary graphics adapter. Auto (default) filter removes iGPUs when at least one dGPU is detected. Restart CapFrameX after changing the primary adapter!

  BENCHLAB Service
  When using BENCHLAB service, unzip the folder in a suitable installation folder like C:\Benchlab Service or D:\Tools, then run the .bat script as admin. Don't install the service from the Download folder. Install latest .NET 9 runtime.

  Enhancements
  - OpenLibreMonitorLib support
    This beta adds support for OpenLibreMonitorLib.
  Install .NET 9 for full library support: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/9.0
  - Integrated PawnIO installer
    The PawnIO installer is now built directly into the CapFrameX installer. No separate installation step is needed anymore.
  - WinRing0.sys security issue resolved
    We have removed the dependency on WinRing0.sys, closing the related security risk.
  - PresentMon updated to version 2.4
    The new PresentMon version adds support for Nvidia Multi Frame Generation (x2, x3, x4) when using the MsBetweenDisplayChange option in the settings menu.
  What is the difference between MsBetweenDisplayChange and MsBetweenPresents?
  - MsBetweenPresents measures the time between present calls from the application. This reflects how often the game submits frames.
  - MsBetweenDisplayChange measures the time between actual displayed frames. This includes any generated frames (e.g., from Frame Generation). Because Multi Frame Generation produces additional frames that are not directly presented by the game, only MsBetweenDisplayChange can show the effective frame rate with FG x2, x3, or x4 enabled.
