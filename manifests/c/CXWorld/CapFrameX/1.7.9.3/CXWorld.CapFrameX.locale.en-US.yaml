  Troubleshooting & Known Issues
  The following tips address the most common issues reported by users and can help resolve stability, overlay, and capture-related problems efficiently. We recommend working through them in order if you encounter unexpected behavior.
  1. Ensure you are running the latest version
     If you experience application crashes or unstable behavior, verify that you have installed CapFrameX v1.7.9 or newer. Many known issues have been resolved in this patch. If you were previously using version 1.7.7, we recommend uninstalling CapFrameX before installing the new version.
  2. Reset application settings
     In some cases, corrupted or outdated configuration files may cause problems. Deleting
     %appdata%/CapFrameX/Configuration/AppSettings.json
     will reset CapFrameX to its default settings and often resolves startup or UI-related issues.
  3. Reset overlay configuration files
     If overlay-related problems persist, try deleting the overlay configuration files located at
     %appdata%/CapFrameX/Configuration/OverlayEntryConfiguration_(0/1/2).json.
     These files will be recreated automatically on the next application start.
  4. Restore missing or zero-value overlay entries
     When overlay entries are missing or display constant zero values, open the Overlay tab and use the Reset button to restore all overlay entries to a valid default state.
  5. Fix incorrect overlay entry order
     If the order of overlay entries appears inconsistent or unintentionally rearranged, use the Sort button in the Overlay tab to restore a clean and logical ordering.
  6. Resolve frametime anomalies after updates
     In rare cases, existing background capture processes can interfere with CapFrameX after an update. If you encounter frametime issues, close all running PresentMon processes before installing or launching CapFrameX v1.7.9.
  7. Avoid conflicts with other monitoring tools
     Applications such as HWiNFO or AIDA64 that implement their own FPS or frametime metrics may conflict with CapFrameX’s capture service, as they also rely on PresentMon-based mechanisms. Disabling overlapping FPS or frametime monitoring features in those tools is strongly recommended when using CapFrameX.
  Known Limitations
  - PC latency metric may return invalid values (NaN) under specific conditions.
  BENCHLAB Service
  When using BENCHLAB service, unzip the folder in a suitable installation folder like C:\Benchlab Service or D:\Tools, then run the .bat script as admin. Don't install the service from the Download folder. Install latest .NET 9 runtime. Download here.
