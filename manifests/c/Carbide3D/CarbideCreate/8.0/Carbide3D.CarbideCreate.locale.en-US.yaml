ShortDescription: CAD/CAM Software for CNC Routers
Description: |-
  Carbide Create is a simple to use yet very powerful CAD/CAM software. It allows you to design, program, and export operations for your CNC with full 3D simulation built in.
  Carbide create uses a context sensitive user interface that only shows you the options that are relevant to your currently selected objects. This means that you are never left with a cluttered interface that has extra options that are not applicable to the task you are trying to perform.
  This also means that you may not see all options available in Carbide Create while navigating through the software at first glance. This is on purpose to allow newcomers to the CAD/CAM hobby to easily complete simple tasks.
  If you are looking for more advanced operations such as boolean tools, vector path grouping, or vector node editing, simply use the shift key to select more than one vector path, or create a vector path, select it, and see what new options appear.
