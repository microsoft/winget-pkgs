Description: GS-Base is a database that lets you store any type of data, text and numeric fields, dates, long text memo fields, files, images, code snippets with syntax highlighting for 16 programming languages. GS-Base can be useful for both simple applications like organizing your photo collections and extracting EXIF tags from photos or analyzing/monitoring your disk contents and to rapidly clean, transform using regex, analyze, perform merges and joins for multi-GB data sets with up to 256 million rows. You can perform both simple and complex record filtering, searching for duplicates, for unique values and frequencies, full-text searches, find-as-you-type, fuzzy searches, searching quartiles, random searches and one-click statistical breakdown analysis. You can use unlimited in-cell charts to spot trends. You can also analyze very large data sets using pivot tables with up to 256 million rows and 16,384 columns. You can use around 300 built-in calculation function in calculated fields, for data validation and conversion. GS-Base can use from 1 to 100 processor cores when updating calculated fields and pivot tables.

InstallationNotes: |-
  Use the following switches to overwrite the default manifest silent installation:
  /interactive - use the complete GUI to install GS-Base, start it and open the sample database automatically
  /no-shortcut - don't create the desktop shortcut
  /portable - portable installation (the settings.xml file is stored in the installation folder, not in the local user’s account system data folder).
  /location - overwrites the default installation folder. For interactive installations you can specify any installation folder in the setup window and this switch only initiates a given value in the corresponding edit field.
             For silent installations:
             if no /location switch is specified, GS-Base looks for any existing previous installation checking the uninstall key and re-uses the previous folder or otherwise installs in the %LOCALAPPDATA%\GS-Base folder if it’s started by normal users and in the c:\Program Files\GS-Base if it’s started by elevated users (admins).
             if the /location switch is specified without a path, GS-Base ignores any existing installation folder and proceeds with the system locations as above,
             if the /location switch is followed by a path, it must be a full path that will be used to install it.
