ShortDescription: GS-Calc is a full featured spreadsheet with unique capabilities for processing big data sets.
Description: GS-Calc is a spreadsheet that can be used for various purposes thanks to its scalability - editing/cleaning CSV, text files with millions of rows, splitting/merging files in the XLSX/XLS, text and other file formats, building complex data models with millions of formulas and around 450 built-in functions. GS-Calc features fast binary lookup's with dynamic internal sorting when processing tens of gigabytes of data or more, 4GB+ workbook files, 32 million rows x 16,384 columns, a unique feature of organizing worksheets in a tree form, pivot tables with 32 million rows and 25 data field functions, up to 64 processor cores during calculations, built-in Monte Carlo Simulations e.g. to easily estimate risk in business, costs, future pensions or simply to reverse-calculate formulas etc., array/"spilling" formulas for any functions written by users in C/C++ as plain DLL libraries even to replace all built-in functions. You can work in up to 100 synchronized panes for each open workbook to monitor results in various sheets and their regions. GS-Calc can be installed on any portable storage device and used without performing any registry modifications.

InstallationNotes: |-
  Use the following switches to overwrite the default manifest silent installation:
  /interactive - use the complete GUI to install GS-Calc, start it and open the sample database automatically
  /no-shortcut - don't create the desktop shortcut
  /portable - portable installation (the settings.xml file is stored in the installation folder, not in the local user’s account system data folder).
  /location - overwrites the default installation folder. For interactive installations you can specify any installation folder in the setup window and this switch only initiates a given value in the corresponding edit field.
             For silent installations:
             if no /location switch is specified, GS-Calc looks for any existing previous installation checking the uninstall key and re-uses the previous folder or otherwise installs in the %LOCALAPPDATA%\GS-Calc folder if it’s started by normal users and in the c:\Program Files\GS-Calc if it’s started by elevated users (admins).
             if the /location switch is specified without a path, GS-Calc ignores any existing installation folder and proceeds with the system locations as above,
             if the /location switch is followed by a path, it must be a full path that will be used to install it.
