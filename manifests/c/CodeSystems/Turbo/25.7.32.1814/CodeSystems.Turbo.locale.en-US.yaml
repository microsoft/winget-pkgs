ReleaseNotes: |-
  The July 2025 update to Turbo Client includes the following new features and improvements:
  - New! Turbo Scan (Beta) command allows scanning images or the desktop for known vulnerabilities. The scan command can generate reports in CycloneDX JSON format and allows for customization of scan depth and paths.
  - New! Turbo Mirror provides real-time, bidirectional file synchronization between running sessions, or between a session and the host. This is the recommended method for keeping folders in sync, such as a downloads folder in a browser session and a local development environment. The feature can be used with the new turbo mirror command or with the --mirror flag on turbo run and turbo start and is designed to work seamlessly with remote sandboxes.
  - The turbo copy and turbo cp commands have been updated to be more intuitive, now conforming to standard rsync style directory arguments and providing clear feedback on the destination of copied files.
  - The turbo run --mount command has been significantly improved to allow mounting a directory from another session's sandbox as a one-way folder share. This allows one session to access the files of another, and can be used to create a shared intermediate storage session. This feature now works reliably with both local and remote sandboxes. For example, to create a shared downloads folder between Chrome and VS Code sessions:
