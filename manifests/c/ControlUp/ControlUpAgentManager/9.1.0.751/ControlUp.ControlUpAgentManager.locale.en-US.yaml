ShortDescription: A Windows service that monitors the ControlUp Agent and restarts it if it stops.
Description: The Real-Time Agent Manager is a Windows service installed on the same machine that the ControlUp Agent Windows service is installed on. Installing the Real-Time Agent Manager also installs the ControlUp Agent. The Real-Time Agent Manager’s main functionality is to act as a “watchdog” for the ControlUp Agent. For example, if the ControlUp Agent stops, the Real-Time Agent Manager restarts the agent. Reciprocally, if the Real-Time Agent Manager stops, the ControlUp Agent restarts the Real-Time Agent Manager.
