ShortDescription: >
  Clear Disk Info is a free software program that provides a clear view of
  health related information about connected storage devices.
Description: >
  Keeping an eye on storage devices is essential when you work with computer
  systems.

  A storage device failure could lead to data loss or corruption of system files
  that prevent certain functionality or the system from booting at all. This
  tools supports S.M.A.R.T. monitoring, NVMe health log and USB connected
  devices. Unlike most tools of the same kind, Clear Disk Info displays the
  information in a human readable, user friendly way.

  A Clear Disk Info license lets you enable automatic disk monitoring, so you
  can receive alerts in case one of your storage device is degrading.
