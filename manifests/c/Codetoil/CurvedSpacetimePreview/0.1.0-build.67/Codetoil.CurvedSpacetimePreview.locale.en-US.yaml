ShortDescription: Curved Spacetime is a work-in-progress easy-to-use modular simulator for General Relativity. This is the Closed-World Native Variant.
Description: |
  Curved Spacetime is a work-in-progress computer program that simulates
  General Relativity whose goal is that it should contain a UI normal people
  can understand while simultaneously being powerful enough for Scientists
  to use.

  A Graphics Card with Ray Tracing and Vulkan 1.3 support is required to run this application.

  There are three main variants of this software:
  - The Quilt Variant, which runs Quilt Loader and is the most extendable. Requires Java 25 to be installed.
  - The Closed-World Jar Variant, which is faster but less extendable. Requires Java 25 to be installed.
  - The Closed-World Native Variant, which is the fastest but least extendable. Does not require Java 25 to be installed, but less Operating Systems are supported.
  
  The version installed by WinGet is the Closed-World Native Variant. Alternative versions can be downloaded from the GitHub Releases page
  or built from the corresponding sources.
