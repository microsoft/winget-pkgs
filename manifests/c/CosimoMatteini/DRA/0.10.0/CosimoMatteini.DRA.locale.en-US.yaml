ShortDescription: A command line tool to download release assets from GitHub

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Added
  - Install RPM assets (#335)
  - Download selection mode now supports wildcard pattern, using *
    and ? special characters, to select the first asset matching the given
    pattern (#271).
    This new feature is useful when release assets contain sections that change for each release (e.g. a build number or
    timestamp).
    For example, dra download -s 'helloworld*_amd64.deb' devmatteini/dra-tests.
    Selection mode is backward compatible with previous versions. You can still pass literal or untagged patterns.
  Changed
  - Rewrite download automatic mode, without any breaking change, to be more customizable, reliable and easier to
    maintain.
  Fixed
  - Handle more Windows OS formats in install script (#336)
