ReleaseNotes: |-
  Added
  - Clifton now supports certificate response version 3.
  - Add option to automatically write the SSH config on a successful auth using clifton auth --write-config=true (PR #139). Thanks to David Llewellyn-Jones (@llewelld).
  Fixed
  - Quote paths in config files. This is required for paths which have spaces in them.
  - Allow --config-file to be passed at any level of subcommands.
  - Allow clifton clear-cache to work if cache directory is missing.
  - Only notify to write config if a change is detected.
  - Store the absolute path of passed identity files, rather than their relative position from where auth was run (Issue #98).
  Changed
  - Retrieve OIDC client ID from the CA rather than setting it in the config. Requires version 0.3 of Conch.
  - Make the clifton ssh-command command hidden.
