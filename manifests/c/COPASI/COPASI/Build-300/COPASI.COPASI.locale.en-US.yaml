ShortDescription: Biochemical System Simulator
Description: |-
  COPASI is a software application for simulation and analysis of biochemical networks and their dynamics.
  COPASI is a stand-alone program that supports models in the SBML standard and can simulate their behavior using ODEs, SDEs, or Gillespie's stochastic simulation algorithm. Arbitrary discrete events can be included in such simulations. COPASI provides a set analysis methods and parameter estimation.
