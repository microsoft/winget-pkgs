ShortDescription: A beautiful, non-destructive, and GPU-accelerated RAW image editor built with performance in mind.
Description: |-
  RapidRAW is a modern, high-performance alternative to Adobe Lightroom®. It delivers a simple, beautiful editing experience in a lightweight package (under 20MB) for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

  RapidRAW is for photographers who love to edit their photos in a clean, fast, and simple workflow. It prioritizes speed, a beautiful user interface, and powerful tools that let you achieve your creative color vision quickly.

  It is not for users who seek absolute, perfect color accuracy. While the results are great for most purposes, the focus is on a fluid, creative process rather than perfect color precision.

  RapidRAW is still in active development and isn't yet as polished as mature tools like Darktable, RawTherapee, or Adobe Lightroom®. Right now, the focus is on building a fast, enjoyable core editing experience. You may encounter bugs - if you do, please report them so I can fix them :) Your feedback really helps!
