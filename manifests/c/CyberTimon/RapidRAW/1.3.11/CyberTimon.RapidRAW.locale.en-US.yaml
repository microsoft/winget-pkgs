ShortDescription: A beautiful, non-destructive, and GPU-accelerated RAW image editor built with performance in mind.
Description: |-
  RapidRAW is a modern, high-performance alternative to Adobe Lightroom®. It delivers a simple, beautiful editing experience in a lightweight package (under 20MB) for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

  RapidRAW is for photographers who love to edit their photos in a clean, fast, and simple workflow. It prioritizes speed, a beautiful user interface, and powerful tools that let you achieve your creative color vision quickly.

  It is not for users who seek absolute, perfect color accuracy. While the results are great for most purposes, the focus is on a fluid, creative process rather than perfect color precision.

  RapidRAW is still in active development and isn't yet as polished as mature tools like Darktable, RawTherapee, or Adobe Lightroom®. Right now, the focus is on building a fast, enjoyable core editing experience. You may encounter bugs - if you do, please report them so I can fix them :) Your feedback really helps!

ReleaseNotes: |-
  ComfyUI Integration
  ComfyUI integration has been significantly improved to make it more accessible and user-friendly. You can now:
  - Select a custom inpainting workflow or use the built-in default workflow.
  - Define and map which models should be loaded.
  - See which custom nodes you need to install, in order to use the default workflow.

  Model Configuration Example:

  RapidRAW automatically handles downscaling, mask generation, patch layer composition, and saving. These enhancements make ComfyUI integration practical for everyday use.
  Note: Some bugs and unfinished elements may still be present. Please report any issues you encounter. Also, if you have a better & easier inpainting workflow, please share it with me as I'm not satisfied with the current one.
  Chromatic Aberration Correction
  A new tool for chromatic aberration correction has been added.

  Other Improvements
  - Changing folders now cancels previous thumbnail generation and folder indexing jobs, preventing performance slowdowns on many machines.
  - LUT's parser is more robust / less error prone now.
  - Mask grow / feather parameter now correctly applies on the final image.
