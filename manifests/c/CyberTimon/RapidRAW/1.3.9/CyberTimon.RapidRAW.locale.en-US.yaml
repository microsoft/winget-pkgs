ShortDescription: A beautiful, non-destructive, and GPU-accelerated RAW image editor built with performance in mind.
Description: |-
  RapidRAW is a modern, high-performance alternative to Adobe Lightroom®. It delivers a simple, beautiful editing experience in a lightweight package (under 20MB) for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

  RapidRAW is for photographers who love to edit their photos in a clean, fast, and simple workflow. It prioritizes speed, a beautiful user interface, and powerful tools that let you achieve your creative color vision quickly.

  It is not for users who seek absolute, perfect color accuracy. While the results are great for most purposes, the focus is on a fluid, creative process rather than perfect color precision.

  RapidRAW is still in active development and isn't yet as polished as mature tools like Darktable, RawTherapee, or Adobe Lightroom®. Right now, the focus is on building a fast, enjoyable core editing experience. You may encounter bugs - if you do, please report them so I can fix them :) Your feedback really helps!

ReleaseNotes: |-
  AI Sky Masks
  RapidRAW now supports one click sky masks. Just hit the sky mask button and RapidRAW will take care of masking the sky for you.
  The pretrained model I’m using comes from this repo and shares the same architecture as the AI foreground model (u2net).
  From my testing, the results are looking really solid:
  ai_sky_mask
  Optimised Image Editing
  One of the biggest bottlenecks in RapidRAW used to be the slow base64 bridge between the backend and frontend. Encoding/decoding large images added a ton of overhead when applying adjustments or just opening files.
  That’s now fixed. I switched over to Tauri’s IPC response, which avoids the whole base64 step. The result: editing feels way smoother, and fullscreen zoom actually loads the full res image so you can check every pixel.
  Full res zoom in action:
  On top of that, I polished a bunch of animations (such as the curves etc) - the whole app should feel more fluid now:

  Big thanks to @tobiaskuntzsch for the full res zoom and the new relative zoom slider: #223

  Running on Windows
  You may see a Windows Defender SmartScreen warning when launching the app.
  - Click "More info" → "Run anyway"
  This happens because the app is not yet signed with a code certificate
