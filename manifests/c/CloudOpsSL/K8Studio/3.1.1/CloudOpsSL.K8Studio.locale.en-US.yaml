ShortDescription: IDE to manage Kubernetes Clusters
Description: |-
  K8 Studio is a cross-platform client IDE to manage Kubernetes Clusters. You can deploy easily to EKS, GKE, AKS, IBM Cloud, or your own bare metal. Connect to your cluster and have a graphical representation of your nodes, pods, services, etc. Access logs, element descriptions, and bash terminal with a single click.
  
  Managing Kubernetes with command-line tools like kubectl can be powerful, but it's also complex and error-prone—especially for growing teams or those new to Kubernetes. That's where a Kubernetes GUI comes in.

  A GUI simplifies cluster management by offering a visual, intuitive interface to interact with your Kubernetes environment. With K8 Studio, you gain clarity, speed, and control—without needing to memorize endless commands.

  - Visual Cluster Insights: See nodes, workloads, and namespaces in real time with our interactive CloudMaps.
  - Faster Troubleshooting: Debug deployments, monitor pod health, and access logs with just a few clicks.
  - Secure Management: Reduce misconfigurations and human error with guided UI workflows.
  - Collaborative Interface: Built for developers, DevOps engineers, and IT teams to work together efficiently.
  - Multi-Cluster Management: Manage and switch between multiple Kubernetes clusters from a single unified dashboard—ideal for enterprise teams and hybrid environments.
  - All-in-One Kubernetes Management Tool: From AI Copilot to integrated terminals, K8 Studio combines the best of GUI and CLI.
