ReleaseNotes: |-
  Multipass version 1.16.0
  We're pleased to announce Multipass 1.16.0, where the entire code base became fully open source! This is a consolidation release, bringing a ton of improvements to our GUI, fixes to the Multipass daemon/service, as well as important security enhancements.
  Notices üì£
  - Fully open source. Previously proprietary bits for Windows and macOS are now part of this repository.
  - Our documentation has been migrated to ReadTheDocs and included in this repository.
  - LXD and libvirt drivers are being deprecated, along with blueprints. The plan is to remove them in the next feature release.
  - This is also likely to be the last release that will support macOS 13.
  Spotlight üåü
  - Custom image launch! It is now supported on macOS and Windows too (with file:// or https:// URLs).
  - GUI improvements:
    - Facilitate reusing launch configurations with a button to "Launch and configure next"
    - Support zoom in the terminal (use Ctrl or ‚åò together with +, -, or 0)
  - Support the QEMU driver on ARM Linux hosts
  Other highlights ‚ú®
  - Start VMs with the "Open shell" button
  - Remember window size + better default sizes
  - Improve copy-paste support
  - Improve gRPC security with standard mTLS
  - Update almost all our dependencies and move some more to Vcpkg
  - Fix 5 different crash conditions (#3978, #4004, #4006, #4010, #4016)
  - Fix issues with mounts, file transfer, and SSH (#3902, #3971, #3959, #4007)
  See also the v1.16.0 milestone for more details.
