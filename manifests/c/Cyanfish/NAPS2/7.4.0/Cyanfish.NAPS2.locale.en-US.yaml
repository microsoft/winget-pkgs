ReleaseNotes: |-
  Changes in 7.4.0:- Added Undo/Redo (from the right-click menu or Ctrl+Z)
      - Deletions can't be undone
  - Added Split/Combine (under the Image menu)
      - Split can be used for book scanning to separate pages
      - Combine can be used to include front/back sides of an ID card in one image
  - Added "Multiple Languages" as an option for OCR (in the OCR language dropdown)
  - Added a "Fix white balance and remove noise" OCR option
      - This can improve OCR with low-quality scans, but will make OCR slower
      - This is equivalent to using "Document Correction" before OCR
  - Upgraded Tesseract from 5.2.0 to 5.3.4 for OCR
  - Added a "Show native TWAIN progress" profile option (under Advanced)
  - Bug fixes
