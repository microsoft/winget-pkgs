  Freeze Frame ‚ùÑÔ∏è üì∏
    With VHS `v0.7.0`, you can capture the any moment during tape execution. Just add in `Screenshot <filename>.png` to your tapes:

    ```
    Type ls
    Enter

    # Capture the output of 'ls'
    Screenshot files.png

    # Now, continue as you normally would
    Type 'cd ..'
    Enter
    ```

    Your tape outputs a GIF, and outputs a file named `files.png`.

  Copy-Paste Functionality!
    VHS can now talk to your system clipboard. Please keep this in mind when executing tapes from unknown sources.

    > [!WARNING]
    > You should never `curl` pipe into VHS, it's similar to executing a bash script on your computer!

    ```
    Copy "https://github.com/charmbracelet/huh"

    Type 'curl '

    Paste

    Enter
    ```

  New Modifiers + Keys Alert!
    VHS `v0.7.0` has some new additions: introducing the top level `Shift+` modifier and the `Insert` + `Delete` keys!

    ```
    # Shift things up a bit!
    Shift+A
    Shift+Tab
    Shift+Enter

    # Insert and delete to your hearts desire:
    Insert
    Delete
    ```
