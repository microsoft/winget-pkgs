ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Popup lists can now be filtered.
      - Press F4 in a popup list to toggle the search mode between "find" and "filter".
      - The clink.popup_search_mode setting controls the default search mode.
      - The clink.popuplist() function can be told to start in a specific search mode.
  - Added os.findfiles() to allow getting files/directories one at a time (versus os.globfiles() which collects the entire set all at once into a table).
  - Added exec.associations setting to let Executable Completion include files with registered file associations as matches (e.g. launchable documents such as "*.pdf" files).
  - Fixed Ctrl-C in a popup list copying the wrong entry after having used Del to delete an entry.
  - Fixed input line coloring to use color.executable also for files included by the exec.path setting, if the files have registered file associations.
