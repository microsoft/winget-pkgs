ShortDescription: >
  Install Creator 2 is a tool designed to quickly and easily build software
  installers, saving developers time.
Description: |-
  Spend your time developing your creations not building the installers. Download
  the fully functional freeware version of Install Creator and create your first
  installation in less than one minute! Then you decide which way is better!

  The free version of Install Creator is fully functional for both commercial and
  non commercial products. Installers built with this version contain an extra
  page when the install is complete, linking back to Clickteam to spread the word
  about Install Creator.

  The registered version of Install Creator is the same as the freeware version,
  but there is no Clickteam advertisement included. You can purchase a registered
  version in our online store, and fax and postal mail registration are also
  available.

  The professional version of Install Creator is designed for professional usage.
  It has powerful features to manage shareware and demo versions of software which
  can be registered. It has the same basic interface as the Freeware and
  Registered versions, but it allows you to bundle multiple versions of your
  product into one installer. You could create one version for unregistered users,
  and one version for registered users. Install Creator will handle the rest.
