ShortDescription: Patch Maker is a tool designed to create small, efficient software updates.
Description: |-
  Need to create small and efficient updates/patches to your program?

  The life of a software product is usually marked by the release of different
  versions. One version differs from the previous one by a small number of
  changes. Some sections of code in the executable files are different, new files
  may be added, some even deleted. What the author of the product usually does is
  provide a whole new version of the files either as a new reinstallable product
  or just the modified files, compressed into an installer.

  The above procedure is very wasteful though. For example, if a file of 1
  megabyte has only had say 10 kilobytes altered inside it, then why create an
  update patch that requires the full 1 megabyte? It would be far more efficient
  if just the altered data was stored. This is the purpose of Patch Maker, as it
  saves a huge amount of bytes by storing just the differences between files and
  even compressing this data.
