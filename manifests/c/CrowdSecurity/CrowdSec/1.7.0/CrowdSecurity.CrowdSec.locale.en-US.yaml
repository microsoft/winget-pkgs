ReleaseNotes: |-
  The 1.7.0 release of crowdsec brings some major changes to how services are auto-detected during installation, and to the metrics shared by the log processors to LAPI.
  The new detection system, cscli setup, is much more flexible and powerful:
  - Supports Linux, BSD and Windows (at the time, auto-detection is only performed at install time for deb and RPM packages)
  - More services are detected out of the box
  - A custom detection configuration can be provided during installation to detect custom services and generate custom acquisition configs (eg, when not using default log paths)
  - The auto-detection can be skipped if the configuration is managed with tools like Ansible
  Learn more about it in our documentation.
  The Log Processors now send metrics about the acquisition (number of lines read and parsed per datasource) and the parsers (number of events parsed, unparsed, or whitelisted) to LAPI.
  Those metrics are shown when running cscli machines inspect XXX.
  In the future, they will also be displayed in the console and used to detect potentially misconfigured or misbehaving installations.
  Other notable changes include:
  - Support for swarm in the docker datasource
  - Better CRS integration in the WAF (this will continue to be improved over time)
  - New expr helpers to compute the average and median time between events
  Warning
  Starting with this release, when crowdsec is run in a docker (or podman) container, a volume must be provided /var/lib/crowdsec/data/, otherwise the container will refuse to start.
  This requirement does not apply to Kubernetes.
  Note
  As previously documented here, the cscli dashboard command has been removed.
  If you are still using the metabase dashboard, we recommend you migrate to https://app.crowdsec.net
