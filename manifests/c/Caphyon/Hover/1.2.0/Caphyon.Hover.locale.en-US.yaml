Description: |-
  Hover is a free tool built by the Advanced Installer team that allows you to run natively installed applications inside an MSIX/App-V container.

  Very often comes the time when you need to debug your applications. We all use PowerShell, but it is unproductive to repeat long commands, so we built a tool that saves your time.

  Hover is included in the “Tools“ section of PacKit. From its GUI you can select the target app container and from the right side pane double click the program you want to launch in the container.

  You can also add new programs to that list, we've just included a predefined list for the most used.
