  Features
  Support new file storage schema
  To support a change in how we store game files, the launcher now differentiates how it constructs the file download URL based on whether the download server is pointing towards Cloudflare R2 or not. This assumption is made to easily retain backwards compatibility with the old file storage schema.
  For custom launchers/wrappers
  If "cloudflare" is contained in the download server name, then the file URL should be constructed as such:
  {download_server_url_base}/{platform_str}/{game_file_posix_path}.gz
  Any other download server (AWS is the only other current download server) may continue to use the existing scheme.
  Tweaks
  - Breaking: Switch to using uncompressed file hash from manifest for validation instead of compressed file hash
  - Make corrupted config file messages more informative
