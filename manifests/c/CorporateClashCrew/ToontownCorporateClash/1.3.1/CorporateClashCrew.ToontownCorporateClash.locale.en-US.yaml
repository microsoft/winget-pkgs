ReleaseNotes: |-
  Fix: apply new S3 naming scheme to file size checks
  The new naming scheme introduced in v1.3.0 was not being applied to the URLs used to get game file sizes during the launcher's checks for updates. This meant that if any new files were uploaded with names that hadn't previously existed in S3, the launcher would error.
  This patch applies the new naming scheme in the required locations of the launcher code.
