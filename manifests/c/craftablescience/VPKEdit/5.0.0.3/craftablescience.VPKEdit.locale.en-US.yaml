ReleaseNotes: |-
  VPKEdit 5.0 is coming soon! It brings with it a bunch of bug fixes and features. I want to delay the proper release to add more features and properly test everything that's changed, so in the meantime here's a beta release.
  Tip
  Read the install guide for assistance installing VPKEdit.
  Note
  Changes made in this beta have an exclamation mark emoji (❗) and old changes may be struck out and replaced where applicable. This changelog is a collection of every beta release up to this point and will continue to be appended to until the final release. (This release is a re-release of beta 2 to fix plugins not loading.)

  - Stop shipping the Qt image format plugins on Windows and in standalone builds, they are not needed anymore

  - Become a more normal application on Linux - depend on system Qt, install to /usr/bin instead of /opt, and start following convention
    - Standalone builds are unchanged
  - Merge standalone CLI and GUI builds into one zip, should make install process slightly easier to figure out
  - Fix program icon install directory on Linux + some mimetypes being incorrectly formatted (thanks @HurricanePootis!)
