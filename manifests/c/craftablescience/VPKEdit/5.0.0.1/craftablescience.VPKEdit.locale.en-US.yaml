ReleaseNotes: |-
  VPKEdit 5.0 is coming soon! It brings with it a bunch of bug fixes and features. I want to delay the proper release to add more features and properly test everything that's changed, so in the meantime here's a beta release.
  I have very limited time these days, and I want to add some big features to VPKEdit like a plugin API for previews, tools, etc. as well as improve some pain points like load time. The 5.0 update is probably a few months out at minimum, but I didn't want to wait that long to make a release. This release should be just as stable as 4.4.2. The 4.x series will no longer be receiving updates.
  Tip
  Read the install guide for assistance installing VPKEdit.
  General Changes
  - Update logo to New VPKEdit logo from Old VPKEdit logo
    - This is much nicer to look at :3
  - Add support for Xbox Zip (XZP) pack file format
  - Properly set RPATH on Linux for standalone builds
  GUI Changes
  - Qt updates
    - Upgrade to Qt 6.8.2 on Windows
    - Use system Qt for Linux installers (third-party vendors are already doing this)
      - Fixes system themes being inaccessible
    - Downgrade to Qt 6.4.2 for standalone Linux builds
  - Improve translations
    - Add Vietnamese translation
    - Update Japanese translation
    - Update Spanish translation
  - Fix pack file name possibly being renamed to a translated text in the status bar
  - Stop crashing when given a DMX file that fails to parse
  - Stop listing elements at the root of a DMX file if it has been referenced in a different element previously
  - Reorganize About dialog
  - Fix possibility of Steam library icons not being populated
    - Used to use a heuristic, now it parses assetcache.vdf directly
  - Explicitly set GLSL profile in shaders to fix model preview breaking on some machines (thanks @Exotic0015!)
  - Add .vint_doc and .vint_proj to text preview
  - Add .qoi to image preview
  - More to come...
  CLI Changes
  - Allow the editing commands (add/remove file/directory) to be repeated
  Installer Changes
  - Add Fedora and Fedora-based distro support (RPM installer)
  - Stop shipping the Qt image format plugins on Windows and in standalone builds, they are not needed anymore
  - Bake Qt base translations into the executable rather than installing as unpacked files
  - Become a more normal application on Linux - depend on system Qt, install to /usr/bin instead of /opt, and start following convention
    - Standalone builds are unchanged
  - Merge standalone CLI and GUI builds into one zip, should make install process slightly easier to figure out
  - Fix program icon install directory on Linux + some mimetypes being incorrectly formatted (thanks @HurricanePootis!)
