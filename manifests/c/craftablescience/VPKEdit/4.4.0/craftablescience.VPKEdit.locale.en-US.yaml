  4.4 Highlights
  - BSP paklump editing is now far more reliable
  - Add support for several pack file types

  General Changes
  - BSP editing should finally be a completely bug-free experience (thanks @Tholp1!)

  - Fix GCF contents not being treated with case sensitivity (again)
  - Fix an error on load when trying to open a VPK directory by opening one of its numbered external archives instead
