ReleaseNotes: |-
  VPKEdit 5.0 is coming soon! It brings with it a bunch of bug fixes and features. I want to delay the proper release to add more features and properly test everything that's changed, so in the meantime here's a beta release.
  Tip
  Read the install guide for assistance installing VPKEdit.

    - Standalone builds are unchanged
  - Merge standalone CLI and GUI builds into one zip, should make install process slightly easier to figure out
  - Fix program icon install directory on Linux + some mimetypes being incorrectly formatted (thanks @HurricanePootis!)
