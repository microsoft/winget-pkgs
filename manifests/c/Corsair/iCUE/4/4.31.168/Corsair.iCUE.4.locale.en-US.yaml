ReleaseNotes: |-
  Software Enhancements
  • NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4000 series cards have been added for NVDIA Broadcast support
  • Resolved an issue with Murals not applying lighting across all RGB fans
  HID Product Enhancements
  • Resolved an issue with HS80 USB Wireless Receiver firmware update
  • Customizing the EQ Switch has been improved but removing the pop-up window that appeared separately from all of the other controls

  DIY Product Enhancements
  • We are aware of an issue with certain AMD platforms causing DDR5 memory detection issues, especially after a Thunderbolt driver update.
    There is a short term implementation in this version of iCUE that will resolve the problem but introduces a slight delay of 30 seconds for the memory to appear in iCUE.
    A more efficient solution will be implemented in the next update and we apologize for the inconvenience.

  • Commander Core XT preset fan curves have been been tuned for less overall noise
  • PSU sensors on dashboard for HXi will no longer appear in a random order
