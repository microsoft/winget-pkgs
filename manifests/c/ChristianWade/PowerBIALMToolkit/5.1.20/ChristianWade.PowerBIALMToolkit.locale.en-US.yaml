ShortDescription: A schema comparison tool for Power BI semantic models
Description: |-
  The ALM Toolkit is a schema comparison tool for Power BI semantic models that enables scenarios such as:
  - Easily deploy changes only to model metadata, whilst retaining data including incremental refresh data.
  - Diff & merge across models/repos with guardrails to ensure the integrity of the resulting model metadata. Pick and choose objects to reuse in other models.
  - Reuse common objects across models. For example, conformed dimensions, standardized date dimensions, and common measures to be standardized across models.
  - Command-line execution for automation.
  ALM Toolkit supports the Tabular Model Definition Language (TMDL) format to view semantic model metadata in a human-readable, YAML-like syntax. See the TMDL documentation page for more information.
