ReleaseNotes: |-
  See https://haskellstack.org/ for installation and upgrade instructions.Release notes:- This release fixes potential bugs.
  - The hash that Stack uses to distinguish one build plan from another has changed for plans that set (as opposed to unset) manually Cabal flags for immutable dependencies. This will cause Stack to rebuild dependencies for such plans.
  Changes since v2.15.5:Major changes:- Stack 2.15.5 and earlier cannot build with Cabal (the library) version 3.12.0.0. Stack can now build with that Cabal version.
  Behavior changes:- Stack's StackSetupShim executable, when called with repl and stack-initial-build-steps, no longer uses Cabal's replHook to apply initialBuildSteps but takes a more direct approach.
  Bug fixes:- Fix a regression introduced in Stack 2.15.1 that caused a 'no operation' stack build to be slower than previously.
  - The hashes that Stack uses to distinguish one build plan from another now include the Cabal flags for immutable dependencies set manually. Previously, in error, only such flags that were unset manually were included.
  Thanks to all our contributors for this release:- JÃ¶rg Thalheim
