ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Add flag --[no-]-only-local-bin to Stack's upgrade command for a binary  upgrade.
    If the Stack executable is my-stack, the default is  my-stack upgrade --only-local-bin where previously it was, effectively,  my-stack upgrade --no-only-local-bin.
    If the Stack executable is stack,  the default is stack upgrade --no-only-local-bin, the same behaviour as  previously.
  - Use $XDG_CACHE_HOME/stack/ghci-script, rather than  <temp>/haskell-stack-ghci (where <temp> is the directory yielded by the  temporary package's System.
    IO.Temp.getCanonicalTemporaryDirectory), as the  base location for GHCi script files generated by stack ghci or stack repl.  See #5203
  - Drop support for Cabal versions before 1.22 and, consequently, GHC versions  before 7.10.
  - stack ghci and stack repl now take into account the values of  default-language keys in Cabal files, like they take into account the values  of default-extensions keys.
  - Removed --ghc-paths, --global-stack-root and --local-bin-path flags for  stack path, deprecated in Stack 1.1.0 in favour of --programs,  --stack-root and local-bin respectively.
  - On Windows, stack upgrade always renames the file of the running Stack  executable (adding extension .old) before attempting to write to the  original file name.
  - On Windows, stack upgrade does not offer sudo command alternatives if  attempting to write to the original file name of the running Stack exectuable  results in a 'Permission' error.
  - Add options of the form --PROG-option=<argument> to stack build, where  PROG is a program recognised by the Cabal library and one of alex, ar,  c2hs, cpphs, gcc, greencard, happy, hsc2hs, hscolour, ld,  pkg-config, strip and tar.
    If Cabal uses the program during the  configuration step, the argument is passed to it.
  - By default all --PROG-option options are applied to all local packages.
    This  behaviour can be changed with new configuration option apply-prog-options.
  - Add flag --[no-]use-root to stack script (default disabled).
    Used with  --compile or --optimize, when enabled all compilation outputs (including  the executable) are written to a script-specific location in the scripts  directory of the Stack root rather than the script's directory, avoiding  clutter of the latter directory.
  - Better error message if the value of the STACK_WORK environment variable or  --work-dir option is not a valid relative path.
  - Stack will use the value of the GH_TOKEN, or GITHUB_TOKEN, environment  variable as credentials to authenticate its GitHub REST API requests.
  - stack uninstall also shows how to uninstall Stack-supplied tools.
  - Fix incorrect warning if allow-newer-deps are specified but allow-newer is  false.
    See  #6068.
  - stack build with --file-watch or --file-watch-poll outputs 'pretty'  error messages, as intended. See  #5978.
  - stack build unregisters any local packages for the sub libraries of a local  package that is to be unregistered. See  #6046.
  - The warning that sublibrary dependency is not supported is no longer triggered  by internal libraries.
