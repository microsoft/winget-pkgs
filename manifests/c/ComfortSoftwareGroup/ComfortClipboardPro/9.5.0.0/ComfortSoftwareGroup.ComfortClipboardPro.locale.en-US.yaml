Description: |-
  Comfort Clipboard Pro is an advanced clipboard manager for Windows designed to extend the functionality of the standard Windows clipboard.
  It allows users to store, organize, and quickly access a history of copied items (text, images, files).

  This clipboard manager keeps the clipboard history that you can use to paste any saved fragment again.
  Now you don’t have to worry that copying one thing will erase something else! The clipboard contents will be saved, even in the case of a system crash or power failure.
  The manager supports all clipboard formats, including text, links, images, files, and all others.

  The following information is displayed for each saved fragment:
  - Brief fragment contents: a text or an image.
  - The icon of the fragment’s format as defined in your system.
  - The icon of the application from which the fragment was copied to the clipboard.
  - Additional brief information for each fragment according to its format.
  - The list of all formats in which the fragment can be used.
  - Preview area.

  The trial version is fully functional but will only work for 30 days.
