ShortDescription: Block-based IDE desktop application
Description: |-
  Alice is an innovative block-based programming environment that makes it easy to create animations, build interactive narratives, or program simple games in 3D. Unlike many of the puzzle-based coding applications Alice motivates learning through creative exploration. Alice is designed to teach logical and computational thinking skills, fundamental principles of programming and to be a first exposure to object-oriented programming. The Alice Project provides supplemental tools and materials for teaching using Alice across a spectrum of ages and subject matter with proven benefits in engaging and retaining diverse and under served groups in computer science education.
  Alice 3 is the latest IDE (integrated development environment) for the Alice programming language. It has all of the features that have make Alice an exciting and creative first programming experience with an added emphasis on object-oriented concepts. Alice 3 has a new rich gallery of models that includes everything you need to spark your creativity including a full The Simsâ„¢ character builder. The new gallery is built upon a class joint structure allowing you to share animations between different characters of the same type. In addition, it has features to assist in a full transition to the Java programming language including viewing the generated Java code side-by-side and even exporting your world into NetBeans to be able to extend the functionality by coding Alice worlds directly in Java.
