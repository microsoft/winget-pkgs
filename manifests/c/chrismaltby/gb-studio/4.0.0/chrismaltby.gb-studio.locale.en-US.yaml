  - Add event "Replace Tile At Position" and "Replace Tile From Sequence" to update background tiles, calling "Replace Tile From Sequence" repeatedly will cycle through animation frames
  - Add new asset folder "Tilesets" for use in "Replace Tile" events

  - Add ability for Actor Move Relative, Actor Set Position Relative and If Actor At Position to use variables as coordinate inputs

  - Add ability to provide color PNGs for backgrounds and extract palettes automatically by either clicking "Auto Color" button in brush toolbar or using dropdown on Scene sidebar next to "Background Palettes" label
  - Add ability to override tile data for auto colored backgrounds by providing a matching *.mono.png in your assets/backgrounds folder containing a monochrome version of the background.

  - Add ability to multi select script events by shift clicking the event's header. When multiple events are selected they can be moved, copied, grouped or deleted at the same time
  - Add ability for scenes, scripts, palettes and image/music assets to be organised into folders by naming them with path separators (/ or \ supported) e.g naming a scene ui/menu/Inventory will place it in a folder ui/menu
