ReleaseNotes: |-
  I am thrilled to announce that I have just released a new version of my xxx application! 🎉 In this new version, I have made numerous code improvements that have positively impacted the program's response time, thereby increasing user comfort. Moreover, I always place a strong emphasis on protecting user privacy and have maintained the highest standards in this regard. 🔒
  I also wanted to make the installation process easier for my users, which is why I have included pre-built MSI installation packages for Windows and Debian Linux. 💻
  I hope my new version will be well-received by my users, and I invite you to download and test the application! 🙏
