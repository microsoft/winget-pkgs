ReleaseNotes: |-
  üå± Spring release üå∏
  This release introduces features and fixes for profile scheduling.
  ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking change
  Until this release, the user scheduling permission was broken. With systemd or the default macOS scheduler, the permission functioned as user_logged_on, running the profile only when the user was logged in.
  This issue is now fixed for new schedules.
  To update existing schedules, run unschedule and then schedule again.
  For systemd, resticprofile requires root privileges (via sudo) to schedule with user permission, as it now uses a system unit running as the user.
  Scheduler
  Scheduling has been significantly improved with the ability to read existing schedules. The status and unschedule commands now detect any resticprofile schedules from the selected configuration file, even if the profile is no longer present.
  Due to recent error reports, Windows Task Scheduler integration has been completely rewritten to use the schtasks CLI tool.
