  ## 🎃 October release 👻

  - upgrade dependencies to fix CVE-2023-3978, CVE-2023-39325 and CVE-2023-44487
  - fix the broken documentation (some tabs were not accessible)

  - detect if the host is running on battery and cancel an action depending on how much battery is left - see [schedule section](https://creativeprojects.github.io/resticprofile/schedules/configuration/index.html#schedule-ignore-on-battery)
