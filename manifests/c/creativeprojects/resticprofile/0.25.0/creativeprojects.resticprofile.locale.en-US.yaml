  The prometheus library used to send metrics to the proxy using protobuf.
  By default it's now using the more widely used text format.If you have any issue sending metrics to your proxy, you can revert to the previous behaviour by adding this option to your profile (it's not a global option)

  my_profile:
    prometheus-push-format: protobuf
