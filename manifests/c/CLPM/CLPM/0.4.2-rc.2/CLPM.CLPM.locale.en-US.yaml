ShortDescription: Common Lisp Project Manager is a project/library manager for Common Lisp that strives to cleanly separate the project manager process itself from the client image that uses it.
Description: >-
  CLPM is a project manager for Common Lisp. It can manage projects in both
  global and project specific contexts. It would be called a "package manager"
  in most other contexts, but the use of "package" unfortunately collides with
  the use of "package" in the Common Lisp spec as a namespace for symbols.


  It consists of two major pieces. First is a standalone program that is
  responsible for all the heavy lifting of downloading and unpacking releases
  in the correct place, resolving dependencies, and managing project specific
  environments. This piece is generally referred to as CLPM, the CLPM core, or
  `clpm` and is distributed as a precompiled executable using SBCL (but it is
  possible to compile it from source). The second is a small client library
  written in portable Common Lisp that interfaces with ASDF and calls CLPM as
  necessary to find and install missing systems. This piece is generally
  referred to as the CLPM client or `clpm-client` and is meant to be loaded
  when you are interactively developing code.


  CLPM is licensed under the two clause BSD license (BSD-2). So, basically do
  what you want with it (while providing appropriate attribution) and don't
  complain if it breaks things. CLPM is currently beta quality so expect some
  breakage and incompatibilites going forward.


  To receive help or report issues please send email to
  <mailto:clpm-devel@common-lisp.net>. Additionally, feel free to join the email list at
  <https://mailman.common-lisp.net/listinfo/clpm-devel>. To join in the
  development of CLPM, you can find the project hosted on the common-lisp.net
  Gitlab server at <https://gitlab.common-lisp.net/clpm/clpm>.
