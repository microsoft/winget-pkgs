ReleaseNotes: |-
  This release is signed with Azure Code Signing! Future releases will be using ACS as well. ACS creates short-lived certificates for signature so the thumbprint is not fixed, however the certificate subject will always be the same.
  Bug fixes
  - Fix portable builds not working if the TranslucentTB temporary directory didn't exist.
  - Fix erroneous "Couldn't configure TAP to restore taskbar appearance once TranslucentTB dies." message in the log.
  - Make Start opened, Search opened and Task View opened states work on newer builds of Windows 11.
  - Fix crashes with GlazeWM and the Magnifier app.
  - Increase the timeout for the XAML TAP to hopefully reduce the amount of "The wait operation timed out" and "Element not found" messages being seen.
  Various improvements/changes
  - Support for Ukrainian locale.
  - Improvements to German and Chinese translations.
  - This releases uses a new GUID for the tray icon, because the ACS certificate subject is different than the previous certificate. Due to this, your preferences related to the tray icon will be reset.
  - Remove the ttb: protocol, as it was an experiment for something that didn't end up working.
