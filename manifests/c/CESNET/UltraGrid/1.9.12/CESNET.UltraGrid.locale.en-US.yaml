  Fixes since last release:
  1.9.12
  - AppImage comatibility improvement (fix missing gnutls, maybe also gdk[_pixbuf])
  - vcap/file: fixes (raw file rewinding + others)
  - vulkan_sdl2: fix (allow) integrated/discrete card selection
  - vcap/decklink: fix color-space change detection (regression)
  - CI build fixes
  1.9.11
  - improve NVENC intra-refresh behavior (ported from master)
  - suppress --cuda-devices help returned error
  - fix multi-tile compress support
  1.9.10
  - fix macOS >= 15.4 init crashes (LC_RPATH dups)
  - build fixes (XIMEA, PCP)
  - fix manual port assignment with send+recv over lo in single process
  - few other less important fixes
  1.9.9
  - build fixes: switch to U22, PCP
  - fix SDL2 I420
  - improve Firejail AppImage compatibility with various params
  - fix WASAPI device selection with UUID
  - CoInitialize: use COINIT_APARTMENTTHREADE (compat with PA/ASIO build)
  - select libvpx-vp9 for VP9 if AVX2 not present (avoid crasn with SVT impl)
  - portaudio: improved sample rate handling
  - Vulkan fixes
  1.9.8
  - build fixes (SVT-VP9, Vulkan)
  - re-enable DELTACAST
  1.9.7
  - fixed vdisp/file crash
  - fixes for irregular (eg. odd) image widths
  - added warnings for potentially wrong configs (alsa, R-S audio)
  - fixed some color conversion
  - NDI fixes - reconnect, 16-bit YCbCr blank if produced in MSW
  1.9.6
  - fixed not working GPUJPEG decoder
  - vcap/rtsp small fixes; but mainly advised to use the development build
    because of plenty of changes/fixes that are not to be backported
  1.9.5
  - CI: updated dependencies (x265, NDI6 et al.)
  - libsvtav1 - hint to use crf instead of bitrate (more comprehensive enhancement in the development version)
  - rtsp client freeze fix
  - fixed capture from OBS virtual cam in Windows
  - fixes some (rare) crashes
  1.9.4
  - new GPUJPEG compat
  - build fixes
  - miscellaneous fixes, but no high severity
