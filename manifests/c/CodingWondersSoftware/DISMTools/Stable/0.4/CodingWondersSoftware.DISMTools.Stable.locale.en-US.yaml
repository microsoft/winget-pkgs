ShortDescription: The connected place for Windows system administration.
Description: DISMTools is an advanced front-end for the Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) tool, with support for projects and installations of any kind (whether it is your active installation or installations on any drive). DISMTools focuses on compatibility, with Windows image support starting from Windows 7 and Server 2008 R2, personalization, letting you customize it the way you want by configuring settings like the DISM executable to use, color modes, languages, and more; and performance, thanks to a combination of the DISM executable and a managed version of the DISM API (thanks to Jeff Kluge (jeffkl) for maintaining it) that provides rich functionality at speed.
