ShortDescription: Helps with Chaos recipes in GGG's Path of Exile
Description: This app fetches your stash data from the PoE servers and shows which items you need to pick up to complete the chaos orb recipe. When you're ready to vendor a set, we'll highlight the item pick order, which is great when you're pulling from messy tabs. Optionally, it can also manipulate your offline loot filter, so you can fully streamline your farm.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Enhancements:
  - Removing the option to 'Select All' tabs from the selector and limiting users to only search 10 Stash Tabs at a time (for both query modes). This further reduces the chances for rate limits ahead of league launch.
  - Increase the size of the Set-by-Set optimized pick indicators for Normal and Premium tabs (Quad tabs are the same).
  Bug Fixes:
  - Fixing incorrect Warning Message for Set Tracker Overlays.
  - Fixed crashes related to users hitting their Rate Limits.
  - Fixed crashes related to users who still had old leagues saved to their settings (this requires a one time soft-setting reset for your currently selected League and Stash Tabs).
