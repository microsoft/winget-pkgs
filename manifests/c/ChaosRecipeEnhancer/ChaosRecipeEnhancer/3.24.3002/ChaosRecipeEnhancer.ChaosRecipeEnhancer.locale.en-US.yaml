ShortDescription: Helps with Chaos recipes in GGG's Path of Exile
Description: This app fetches your stash data from the PoE servers and shows which items you need to pick up to complete the chaos orb recipe. When you're ready to vendor a set, we'll highlight the item pick order, which is great when you're pulling from messy tabs. Optionally, it can also manipulate your offline loot filter, so you can fully streamline your farm.
