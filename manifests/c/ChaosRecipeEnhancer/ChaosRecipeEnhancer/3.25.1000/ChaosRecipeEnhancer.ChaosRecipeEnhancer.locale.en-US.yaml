ShortDescription: Helps with Chaos recipes in GGG's Path of Exile
Description: This app fetches your stash data from the PoE servers and shows which items you need to pick up to complete the chaos orb recipe. When you're ready to vendor a set, we'll highlight the item pick order, which is great when you're pulling from messy tabs. Optionally, it can also manipulate your offline loot filter, so you can fully streamline your farm.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Howdy, hey! Happy pre-3.25 league launch! Excited to be a part of your currency-farming journey. Best of luck to all of us.The new installer should automatically replace older versions of the app. If you find it doesn't, you'll want to manually uninstall your previous CRE installation(s) and re-run this latest installer.
  Enhancements:
  - (Re) Adding support for Guild Stash picking.
  - Added fancy pants Filter Style Editor form. This adds a massive amount of filter customization options - from font sizing and colors, border colors, map icons of all varieties, even item light beams.
      - I basically tried my best to copy the FilterBlade form, since it has an amazing user experience. This replaces the old 'Colors' form. Rest in Pieces. ðŸª¦ (Shout-out to @NeverSinkDev)
  - Added the option to disable our 'Space Saving' features for the purposes of Loot Filter Manipulation. When disabled, users will be able to see eligible 'large' weapons or shields for their Recipes. These options remain on by default. Recipe composition (Set Picking) continues to ignore these size limitations.
  - Added a resizable scaling setting for the Set Tracker Overlay (works with all display modes).
  - Item counts on all Set Tracker Overlay display modes should now have better visibility, even when item classes are in a 'Disabled' state.
  - Added better preview text and tooltip for the Stash Tab Selector drop-down menu.
  - Refined the wording on various setting labels and setting tooltips.
  - Re-implemented the optimized set picking order indicators for 'Set-by-Set' Item Picker Mode on the Stash Tab Overlay.
  - Reduced the volume of the sound notification for Filter Reloading.
  - Adding an option to omit (Remove-only) tabs from the Stash Tab Selection options.
  - (Re) Adding support for Legacy Auth (Session ID). OAuth is still the default auth mechanism.
  Bug Fixes:
  - Fixed an issue where item composition was broken when either Vendor Sets Early or Do Not Preserve Low Level Items settings were disabled.
  - Fixed an issue related to Rings not being filtered properly.
  - Fixed an issue related to Regal Recipe item set composition.
  - Fixed an issue related to Chaos Recipe filtering when needing low item level items.
  - Fixed an issue related to the Set Tracker Overlay not accurately reflecting the 'Always Active' and 'Always Hidden' user settings.
  - Fixed an issue where tabs that cannot hold items for recipes (e.g. Map tabs) would be loaded to Stash Tab Selector drop-down menu.
  - Fixed an issue where the disclaimer text was moving around when navigating to different tabs.
  - Fixed some behavior related to related settings not getting reset properly (e.g. Changing your League will now reset your selected Stash Tabs).
  - Fixed various typos and small visual bugs.
  - Fixed crash related to an invalid Path of Exile Client.txt path when enabling Auto-Fetch.
