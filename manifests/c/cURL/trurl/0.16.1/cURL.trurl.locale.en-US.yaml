ShortDescription: a command line tool for URL parsing and manipulation.
Description: |-
  trurl is a command line tool that parses and manipulates URLs, designed to help shell script authors everywhere.

  URLs are tricky to parse and there are numerous security problems in software because of this.

  trurl wants to help soften this problem by taking away the need for script and command line authors everywhere to re-invent the wheel over and over.

  trurl uses libcurl URL parser. It parses and understands URLs exactly the same way curl the command line tool does - making it the perfect companion tool.
