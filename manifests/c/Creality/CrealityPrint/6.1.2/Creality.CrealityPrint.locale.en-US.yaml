  New Features
  1.  Added support for Creality WiFi Box-related features and printers connected via WiFi Box.
  2.  Improved file saving efficiency when using "Save Project As".
  3.  Optimized the automatic model layout function.
  4.  Improved the Copy & Paste (Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V) experience — pasted models will no longer overlap.
  5.  Enhanced the Clone (Ctrl+K) operation with a preview effect when cloning models.
  6.  Optimized model placement upon import — models are now automatically arranged (this behavior can be disabled in Preferences).
  7.  Added a new "Layout Selected" feature to the Auto Layout function — only the selected models will be arranged within the build plate.
  8.  Improved behavior during single-plate layout — when models do not fit within the plate, they will no longer "disappear" but instead be placed above Plate 1.
  9.  Enhanced the Fill Build Plate feature — added a secondary menu allowing adjustments such as model spacing.
  10. Introduced a Grid Layout option within the Fill Build Plate feature — models are forcibly arranged in a tidy checkerboard pattern, with a visual preview.
  11. Enhanced the file sending page with additional information, including real-time transfer speed display.
