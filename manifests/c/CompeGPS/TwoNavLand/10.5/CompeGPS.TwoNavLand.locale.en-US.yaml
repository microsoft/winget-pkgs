Description: |-
  Land is the most reliable tool to plan your own routes precisely on high quality maps. It allows you to create, edit tracks and analyze the most important data of your itineraries, such as times, distances and gradients by section, offering you the possibility to evaluate alternatives and visualize the safest option

  - Use files from any source, Land is compatible with multiple formats (*.GPX, *.FIT, *.KML...). You can download routes for the area you want to visit from important providers like Komoot, Wikiloc, OpenRunner, UtagawaVTT, IGN Rando and even... from other TwoNav users!
  - Create routes in the most agile way, whether point to point or freehand drawing. You can also use existing routes to modify their paths according to your needs: cut the sections of the route that don't interest you, join parts of other routes, or extend them as far as you want
  - Get informed about the weather forecast while planning your route. Check the weather forecast for a specific location several days in advance or, if you prefer, consult specialized weather maps with information on precipitation, cloud cover, wind...
  - Enrich your routes with extra information on the most relevant points, whether they are maneuvers or points of interest. Add reminders and important information on your route, in the form of an icon, sketch, text, image or sound
  - Prepare different alternatives to adapt your itinerary to any unforeseen event: fatigue, road conditions, weather... Add shortcuts to your routes or optional visits to points of interest on the same track
  - Mark your points of interest on the map and organize them into collections to find them easily. You can import waypoints or create them yourself, either on the map or by entering coordinates. Attach text, image or sound to have all the information you need
