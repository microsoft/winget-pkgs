Description: |-
  PrintSCP transforms the way medical studies are printed, replacing traditional film with high-quality paper printing from Windows, providing printed copies to patients and referring physicians.

  It acts as a DICOM print server that receives images from various modalities and prints them using Windows technology. It stands out for its ability to handle multiple simultaneous connections and its calibration process that ensures correspondence between monitor display and paper printing.

  It easily customizes the header and footer with client information and offers options such as real-size printing, various film and paper formats, and output to JPEG, PDF, or DICOM files.
