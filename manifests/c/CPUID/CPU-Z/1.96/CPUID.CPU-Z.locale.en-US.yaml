ShortDescription: A freeware system profiler (system monitor) application that detects the central processing unit, RAM, motherboard chipset, and other hardware features of a modern personal computer, and presents the information in one window
Description: CPU-Z is more comprehensive in virtually all areas compared to the tools provided in the Windows OS to identify various hardware components, and thus assists in identifying certain components without the need of opening the case; particularly the core revision and RAM clock rate. It also provides information on the system's GPU.
