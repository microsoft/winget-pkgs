ReleaseNotes: |-
  Building System Optimizer v1.7 contains the following changes:
  - Implemented a new project management system. Each project is stored in a single file that can be placed anywhere and moved or renamed at any time. The program remembers the location of project files and displays them on a ‘most recently used projects’ list.
  - Implemented a new software security scheme using a license key. The license key is issued when you first license the software and expires when the license expires. A new key is provided each time you renew the license to extend operation for another year. Note that the license key is associated with your license, not a particular version of the software.
  - Implemented a new installation approach. Version 1.7 installs as a standalone software program. Installation of Carrier X Builder Framework is no longer required.
