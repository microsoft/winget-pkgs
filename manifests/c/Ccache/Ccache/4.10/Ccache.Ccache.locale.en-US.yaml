ReleaseNotes: |-
  New features and improvements
    - Added support for GCC option `-fcallgraph-info`.
      [contributed by Raihaan Shouhell]

    - Added support for GCC option `-fprofile-update`.
      [contributed by Raihaan Shouhell]

    - Added support for GCC option `-fdump-ipa-clones`.
      [contributed by Jiri Slaby]

    - Added support for the MSVC `/Yc` option (precompiled header).
      [contributed by Clemens Wasser, Thomas Ferrand and Silver Zachara]

    - Added support for the MSVC `/Tc<path>` and `/Tp<path>` options (specifying source code type).
      [contributed by Joel Rosdahl]

    - Added an experimental inode cache implementation for Windows. This speeds up ccache a lot when many headers are included, both for cache hits and cache misses.

    > NOTE:
    > This feature is currently disabled by default, but interested Windows users are encouraged to try it out by setting [inode_cache = true](https://ccache.dev/manual/4.10.html#config_inode_cache).

      [contributed by Thomas Ferrand]

    - Added knowledge of Xcode option `-ivfsstatcache`.
      [contributed by Joel Rosdahl]

    - Added support for Apple Clang option `-Xpreprocessor -fopenmp` in direct mode.
      [contributed by Joel Rosdahl]

    - Added knowledge of Emscripten option `--em-config`.
      [contributed by Byoungchan Lee]

    - Reduced the risk of false positive direct mode hits.
      [contributed by Joel Rosdahl]

    - Clear direct mode manifest on recache.
      [contributed by Joel Rosdahl]

    - Optimized file reading on Windows.
      [contributed by Clemens Wasser]

    - Optimized file copying performed when [hard linking](https://ccache.dev/manual/4.10.html#config_hard_link) or [file cloning](https://ccache.dev/manual/4.9.html#config_file_clone) is enabled.
      [contributed by Raihaan Shouhell]

    - Use `posix_spawn(3)` for executing compiler check commands.
      [contributed by Brendan Shanks]

    - The [prefix_command](https://ccache.dev/manual/4.10.html#config_prefix_command) and [prefix_command_cpp](https://ccache.dev/manual/4.10.html#config_prefix_command_cpp) configuration options now allow any prefix, not only programs that exist in `PATH`. This means that prefix_command now can be a program with arguments.
      [contributed by Joel Rosdahl]

    - Added a new `incbin` [sloppiness](https://ccache.dev/manual/4.10.html#config_sloppiness) value for ignoring presence of `.incbin` directives in the source code.
      [contributed by Raihaan Shouhell]

    - Added a `--print-log-stats` option that prints a machine-parsable variant of `--show-log-stats`.
      [contributed Kaspar Schleiser]

    - Added a `--format` option for selecting JSON or tab format for `--print-stats` and `--print-log-stats`.
      [contributed Kaspar Schleiser]

    - Added a `--print-version` option for printing ccache version in machine-parsable format.
      [contributed by Silver Zachara]

    - The `--inspect` option now retains access time (atime) of the inspected file if possible.
      [contributed by Joel Rosdahl]

  Bug fixes
    - Fixed reading of files larger than 2^31 bytes on some systems where this was a problem.
      [contributed by Joel Rosdahl]

    - Improved handling of large files on 32-bit systems.
      [contributed by Joel Rosdahl]

    - Nonexistent include files are allowed in preprocessor mode again, fixing regression in ccache 4.9.1.
      [contributed by Joel Rosdahl]

    - The Clang `-fdiagnostics-color` option is now handled again, fixing regression in ccache 4.6.2.
      [contributed by Joel Rosdahl]

    - Fixed assertion failure on Windows mapped network drives.
      [contributed by Joel Rosdahl]

    - Fixed handling of MSVC options `/Fp` and `/Yu`.
      [contributed by Silver Zachara]

    - Fixed lock file implementation on MSYS2.
      [contributed by an anonymous user]

    - The “apparent real path” of the object file is now added to the input hash when using `-fprofile-arcs` to avoid false positive hits in some scenarios.
      [contributed by Joel Rosdahl]

    - When generating profiling information, [run_second_cpp](https://ccache.dev/manual/4.10.html#config_) is now forced to true so that the coverage report won’t refer to a temporary preprocessed file.
      [contributed by Joel Rosdahl]

  Build improvements
    - Improved handling of ccache dependencies. A new `DEPS` CMake variable selects how software library dependencies should be located or retrieved, replacing the old `HIREDIS_FROM_INTERNET`, `ZSTD_FROM_INTERNET` and `OFFLINE` variables. Options are `AUTO` (the default) for automatically downloading missing dependencies, `DOWNLOAD` for always downloading and `LOCAL` for never downloading. See [Software library dependencies](https://github.com/ccache/ccache/blob/v4.10/doc/INSTALL.md#software-library-dependencies) for details.
      [contributed by Joel Rosdahl]

    - Added support for using a local installation of BLAKE3, cpp-httplib, nonstd-span and tl-expected instead of linking to bundled copies.
      [contributed by Joel Rosdahl]

    - Removed bundled copies of doctest, fmt, getopt_long and xxhash.
      [contributed by Joel Rosdahl]

    - Changed to use the Windows BLAKE3 implementation when building on MSYS2.
      [contributed by Joel Rosdahl]

  Documentation improvements
    - Improved documentation of “gcno_cwd sloppiness”.
