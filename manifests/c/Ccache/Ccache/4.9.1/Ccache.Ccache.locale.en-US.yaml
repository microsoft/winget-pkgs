ReleaseNotes: |-
  Bug fixes
    - Improved detection of bad remote storage URLs gracefully. This also fixes crashes seen in ccache’s own test suite.
      [contributed by Joel Rosdahl]

    - Made caching completely disabled when modification of a source or include file is detected during ccache invocation. Previously this was only done for the direct mode.
      [contributed by Joel Rosdahl]

    - Fixed an MSVC crash when using /Zi with many concurrent compilations.

    - Fixed a crash when -arch is the last compiler option.
