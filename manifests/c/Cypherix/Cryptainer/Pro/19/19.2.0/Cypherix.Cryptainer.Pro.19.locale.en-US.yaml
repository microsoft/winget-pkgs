ShortDescription: Disk Encryption Software
Description: |-
  Our flagship product, Cryptainer Pro Encryption is a powerful on-the-fly disk encryption package that uses cutting edge strong encryption. Cryptainer supports Blowfish at 448 bits, as well as, AES at 256 bits. It creates an encrypted virtual hard disk within which all sensitive information can be stored.
  A single password allows access to the virtual disk, thereby eliminating the need to remember separate passwords for each encrypted file. Cryptainer's ease of use and deployment coupled with its speed and versatility makes it an ideal security tool for all environments.
