  New features
  - E-book viewer: Support for jumping to and displaying paper edition page numbers
    If an e-book contains embedded information about the pages from the paper edition of the book, the calibre E-book viewer can now jump to a page number via the Go to button in the viewer controls. You can also optionally have the current paper edition page number displayed in the header/footer by adding "Pages from paper edition" to either the header or footer in the viewer settings.
  - Edit book: When text is selected allow changing the indentation of all lines in the selection by pressing Tab to increase one level or Shift+Tab to decrease one level
