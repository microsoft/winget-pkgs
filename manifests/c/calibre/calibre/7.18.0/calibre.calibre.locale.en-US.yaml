  New features
  - E-book viewer: Read aloud: A new Text-to-Speech engine (Piper) that uses a neural network for realistic sounding voices
    To use it access the viewer controls and click the Read aloud button or press 'Ctrl+S'. The neural network is run locally, no cloud services are used. Using the OS Text-to-Speech engine is still possible by clicking the configure button on the Read aloud control bar. Note that the new engine highlights the currently read sentence rather than word.
