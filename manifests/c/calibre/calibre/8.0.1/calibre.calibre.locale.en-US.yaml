  New features
  - Much improved Kobo support
    calibre can now natively edit, view and convert KEPUB format files used by the Kobo. It also automatically converts EPUB to KEPUB when sending books to Kobo devices (can be configured by right clicking the kobo icon in calibre).
  - Connect to folder: Allow connecting a specific device
    calibre can now connect to a folder and treat it as though it is a USBMS based device. This is useful particularly on Chromebooks where USB devices appear as folders rather than actual devices.
  - When completing names for fields that contain hierarchical data in prefix mode match prefixes after every period
