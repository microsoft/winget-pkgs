ReleaseNotes: |-
  Donations are appreciated. There is now a new PayPal option.Changes from 2.1.6 to 2.1.7:
  Changes/additions/improvements:- Some improvements for hotkey and global media key handling. This for example fixes a problem caused by a Windows/Chrome/Edge bug where clicking on notifications could send a keypress with value 0 to wrong window, which could trigger hotkey actions in MPC-HC.
  - This adds a new option to display audio track details in the statusbar. Note: Statusbar info does not (yet) update when changing audio track through splitter tray icon, only when doing it using player functionality.
  Fixes:- Fixed a crash when using libass and subtitles were (partially) located outside of visible video area.
  - A few other small fixes and improvements.
  Overview of features
  A lot of people seem to be unaware of some of the awesome features that have been added to MPC-HC in the past years. Here is a list of useful options and features that everyone should know about:- Play HDR video
  This requires using either MPC Video Renderer (MPCVR) or madVR.
  After installation these HDR capable renderers can be selected here:
  Options > Playback > Output
  With other video renderers, the colors will be wrong!
  I recommend installing K-Lite Codec Pack. That includes MPC-HC and the renderers all in one easy to use package.
  MPCVR is available as a separate download below. MPCVR supports Dolby Vision. MadVR does not.
  You should change hardware decoder to D3D11 in LAV Video Decoder settings when using MPCVR on Windows 10/11, because renderer will use DirectX11.
  - Modern GUI Theme (Dark or Light)
  Options > Player > User Interface
  It is also possible to change the height of the seekbar and size of the toolbar buttons.
  - Video preview on the seekbar
  Options > Player > User Interface
  - Ability to search for subtitles
  Press D for manual search.
  Or enable automatic search in: Options > Subtitles > Misc
  - Adjust playback speed
  Menu > Play > Playback rate
  The buttons in the player that control playback rate take a 2x step by default. This can be customized to smaller values (like 10%):
  Options > Playback > Speed step
  Adjusting playback speed works best with the internal audio renderer. This also has automatic pitch correction.
  Options > Playback > Output > Audio Renderer
  - MPC-HC can remember playback position, so you can resume from that point later
  Options > Player > History
  - You can quickly seek through a video with Ctrl + Mouse Scrollwheel.
  - You can jump to next/previous file in a folder by pressing PageUp/PageDown.
  - You can perform automatic actions at end of file. For example to go to next file or close player.
  Options > Playback > After Playback (permanent setting)
  Menu > Play > After Playback (for current file only)
  - A-B repeat
  You can loop a segment of a video. Press [ and ] to set start and stop markers.
  - You can rotate/flip/mirror/stretch/zoom the video
  Menu > View > Pan&Scan
  This is also easily done with hotkeys (see below).
  - There are lots of keyboard hotkeys and mouse actions to control the player. They can be customized as well.
  Options > Player > Keys
  Tip: there is a search box above the table.
  - You can stream videos directly from Youtube and many other video websites
  Put yt-dlp.exe in the MPC-HC installation folder.
  Then you can open website URLs in the player: Menu > File > Open File/URL
  You can even download those videos: Menu > File > Save a copy
  Tip: to be able to download in best quality with yt-dlp, it is recommended to also put ffmpeg.exe in the MPC-HC folder.
  Several YDL configuration options are found here: Options > Advanced
  This includes an option to specify the location of yt-dlp.exe in case you don't want to put it in MPC-HC folder.
  Note 1: You also need to install Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 SP1 Redistributable Package (x86)
  Note 2: yt-dlp nightly build (very latest version made daily)
  - Besides all these (new) features, there have also been many bugfixes and internal improvements in the player in the past years that give better performance and stability. It also has updated internal codecs. Support was added for CUE sheets, WebVTT subtitles, etc.
