ReleaseNotes: |-
  What if SBOM tool developers utilised their tool's SBOM to make the project leaner, safer, and better? This curiosity led to the new minor release of cdxgen v11.4.x. We utilised two powerful features in pnpm package manager - aliasing and overrides to continuously generate an SBOM, test, and optimise the dependency tree. We reduced the dependency count by a whopping 10% and artefact binary sizes by 5% without losing any functionality! We then applied the same principle to trim our container images, implemented multi-stage builds for better caching, and implemented per-architecture signed SBOM attachment for the first time (Thanks @malice00). For fans of Alpine Linux, cdxgen container images are now available with Alpine base images for top languages. We are also making a static musl-linked single executable binary available for effortless rollout across a number of OS including IoT devices!
