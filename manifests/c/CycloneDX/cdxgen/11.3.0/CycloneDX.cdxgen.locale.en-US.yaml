ReleaseNotes: |-
  This is a major release. cdxgen now uses Node 24 in single executable applications (sea) and container images for improved performance. For the first time, our sea binaries are built with pnpm node_modules and therefore have an identical dependency tree to the source and container images. Thanks to the excellent work from @malice00, our build workflows are modernised and scalable. We have also trimmed multiple container images by removing Java and other unneeded packages without any loss of functionality (For instance, by using atom native binary which doesn't require Java).
