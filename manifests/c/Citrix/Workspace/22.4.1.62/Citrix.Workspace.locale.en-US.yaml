  Fixed issues in 2204.1
  Session/Connection
  • Citrix ADC appliance might crash when certain conditions are triggered from Citrix Workspace app for Windows. [HDX-39496]

  • When you try to redirect to the preferred webcam as set in the Citrix Workspace app for Windows, the setting might not be executed as configured.
