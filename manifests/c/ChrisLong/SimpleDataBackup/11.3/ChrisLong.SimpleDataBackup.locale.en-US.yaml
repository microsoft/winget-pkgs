ShortDescription: >
  Simple Data Backup is free, easy, and efficient backup software that creates
  non-proprietary backups.
Description: |-
  It can back up folders/files from one drive to another anytime you want
  on-demand (including with an optional direct shortcut on your desktop to run
  the backup), on a schedule, or at logon. Back up to another hard drive, flash
  drive, network drive, the 'cloud' (Internet server) via FTP/SSH/WebDav, and
  more. It can create identical folder/file structures on the backup drive, or
  can compress the data as .ZIP or LZMA2-compressed .7z files. It can back up
  "in use" files (including Outlook data), monitor and alert you to any errors
  including potentially by email/SMS or reporting status to the web, and it
  automatically handles the whole full/incremental backup thing that other
  programs make you deal with. Simple Data Backup is powerful and stable
  software, but also simple - just pick the folders you want to be backed up and
  a few settings and you're done!

  With over 15 years of development behind it, Simple Data Backup is trusted and
  stable. Contains NO spyware, adware, viruses, or malware of any kind.
