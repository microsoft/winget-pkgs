ShortDescription: A multithreaded CLI for digital media processing using ffmpeg
Description: ffzap is a simple, fast command-line tool for processing media files with ffmpeg. As it's multithreaded and can run as many tasks in parallel as your system can handle, it's perfect for converting, compressing, or editing audio and video files quickly and efficiently.Because it uses ffmpeg under the hood, it supports any media file processing that ffmpeg can handle.
