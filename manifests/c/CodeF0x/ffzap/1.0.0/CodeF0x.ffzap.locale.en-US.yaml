ShortDescription: A multithreaded CLI for digital media processing using ffmpeg
Description: ffzap is a simple, fast command-line tool for processing media files with ffmpeg. As it's multithreaded and can run as many tasks in parallel as your system can handle, it's perfect for converting, compressing, or editing audio and video files quickly and efficiently.Because it uses ffmpeg under the hood, it supports any media file processing that ffmpeg can handle.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Version 1.0.0 is out!Note: When running ffzap without either --input or --file-list, it will prompt that both --input-directory and --input-file are missing and required. This is a bug. Either --input or --file-list are required. Both --input-directory and --input-file won't work and throw an error. This is not critical and does not affect ffzap in its actual functionality. Both --input-directory and --input-file will get removed with the next version of ffzap.Features:
  - -f / --ffmpeg-options is optional now, allowing to change container formats, etc.
  Breaking Changes:
  - --input-directory got deprecated in favor of --input
  - --input-file got deprecated in favor of --file-list
  Please read about why here. For a guide on how to migrate to version 1.0.0, read this.
