ShortDescription: Program for converting CSV files from banks to MT940 files. Designed for self-employed individuals and SMEs who use personal bank accounts or accounting software that is incompatible with the latest MT940 variants.
Description: |-
  For efficient bookkeeping, it is useful to be able to import bank transactions into an (online) accounting package. Almost all accounting packages import bank transactions using so-called MT940 files. Nearly all business bank accounts also offer the option to export bank transactions to an MT940 file. From version 2.0 onwards, CAMT053 files can also be generated.
  However, many self-employed professionals and small businesses do not use business bank accounts. Non-business bank accounts have the advantage of being significantly cheaper than their business counterparts. However, most non-business bank accounts do not offer the option to export to MT940 files. These accounts can generally only export to CSV.
  The MT940 Creator addresses this need. With the MT940 Creator, you can convert CSV files from banks such as ING Bank, Rabobank, Triodos, KNAB Bank, SNS, and Leaseplan Bank into an MT940 file. Additionally, you can also convert CSV files from payment providers like PayPal, Sisow, Buckaroo, PaySquare, and Atos Worldline into an MT940 file.
  The program has been tested in combination with various accounting environments, including BIZZcounter, Davilex Online, Exact Online, Minipak, Snelstart, InformerOnline, Reeleezee, AFAS (personal), Cash Software, E-Boekhouden, and MoneyBird.
