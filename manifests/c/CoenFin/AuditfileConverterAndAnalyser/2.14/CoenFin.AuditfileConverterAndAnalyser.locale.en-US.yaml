ShortDescription: Program for converting and analyzing audit files.
Description: |-
  Audit files enable the exchange of data between administrative systems using a standard format. This is convenient because no specific knowledge of different accounting packages is required. The data can then be further analyzed in a custom analysis tool.
  The initiative for the development of audit files originally came from the tax authorities. The first version was released in 1999 in the form of an ASCII text file (ADF). Later, its successor was introduced in the form of an XML file, known as the XAF audit files. The first version of this was version 2.0. Currently, development is more driven by commercial parties. The current versions are in the 3.x series.
  In addition to the tax authorities, audit files are also very useful for other parties such as accountants and consultants. In this context, the tax authorities provided an Auditfile Viewer, which can be downloaded for free via softwarepakketten.nl. However, the tax authorities stopped developing the viewer in 2008. As a result, the latest versions (3.x series) of the audit file are not supported.
  This program is the successor to Auditfile Converter version 1 (from 2014). The first version addressed the issue of newer audit file versions not working in, for example, the Auditfile Viewer from the tax authorities, and the problem of split audit files that needed to be merged. However, the first version of the Auditfile Converter had issues with overly large fields due to the underlying database used. Therefore, the program has been completely rewritten and now offers, in addition to the features already available in the first version, options for performing limited analyses on the data imported into the database. Additionally, the Auditfile Converter is also available for MAC and, upon request, for Linux.
  From version 2.10, it is also possible to import and analyze Payroll audit files. And from version 2.14, Auditfile POS systems and Auditfile Trip Administration.
