ShortDescription: Program for analyzing bank files such as CAMT053, MT940, CODA. Additionally, it allows exporting to Excel. It is also possible to view SEPA payment and direct debit files.
Description: |-
  For conducting analyses on bank files, it is useful to have a tool that can make digital bank files such as CAMT053, CAMT052, MT940, OFX (Open Financial Exchange), and Belgian CODA files readable. Additionally, SEPA payment and direct debit files can also be displayed using this tool. The data in these files can be exported with this program to Excel (for further analysis), to HTML (to view the bank transactions in bank statement format), or to an MT940, CAMT053, or OFX file (for example, to merge CAMT files or convert an MT940 to CAMT053 format and vice versa). Furthermore, the database (sqlite) can be exported for analysis purposes in tools like Power BI.
  Moreover, there are analysis features such as searching for text, drilling down on counterparties (PartyIBAN), Benford Law Analysis, identifying account numbers linked to multiple names, transactions by weekday, etc. These analysis features will be further expanded in upcoming versions.
  The program can be seen as the successor to the MT940 Reader. However, the BankStatement Analyzer can handle CAMT files and splits the :86: tag of MT940 files (currently from major banks in the Netherlands) into separate fields based on specific structured fields.
