ShortDescription: Program for converting PDF and WORD (sales) invoices to UBL format.
Description: |-
  This program is designed for entrepreneurs and administrative and accounting firms of entrepreneurs who create sales invoices in Word or Excel, or use an invoicing program that generates PDF invoices but not digital invoices in the form of UBL invoices, which can be directly processed in an accounting package.
  This program aims to address this issue. If sales invoices are relatively homogeneous, it is very time-consuming to manually enter all of them. After all, it is double work because all the relevant information is already included on the invoice when it is created in Word/Excel or an invoicing program.
  With this program, you can create smart templates that allow you to convert sales invoices in bulk into digital UBL invoices. You can directly email these UBL invoices to your online accounting environment (e.g., Exact Online). You only need to approve them, and you will have both a booking and a PDF version of the invoice in your administration.
