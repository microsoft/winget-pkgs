ShortDescription: Easily locate files that are not inheriting permissions from their parent folder or have additional explicit permissions. Export the results or optionally reset inheritance and remove explicit permissions.
Description: |-
  File Permissions Check provides a simple and intuitive GUI that you can use to scan your file shares to discover files that are not compliant with the permissions you have placed on your folders. Once such files have been located by the program, you have the option to set them back to inheriting permissions and remove any explicit permissions on them

  Features
  - Easy to use, intuitive GUI
  - Scan multiple folders and optionally ignore system files/folders or files in sub folders more than a specified number of levels deep
  - Locate files that are not inheriting permissions or files that are inheriting but have additional explicit permissions, or both
  - Export results to CSV file or HTML file
  - Once files have been located, the program can reset inheritance and remove explicit permissions from any selected files
