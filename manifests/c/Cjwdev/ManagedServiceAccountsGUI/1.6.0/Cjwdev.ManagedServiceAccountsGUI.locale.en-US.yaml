ShortDescription: Managed Service Accounts are a useful new feature introduced in Server 2008 R2 but they can only be created and managed with Powershell, so this tool was created to provide an intuitive GUI that will let you create, edit, and install them
Description: |-
  Managed Service Accounts are a great new feature that was added to Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows 7, but up until now the only way to create and configure them has been via Powershell cmdlets (requiring at least 3 separate commands to be run, one of which has to be run locally on the computer that will use the MSA). So we created this tool to provide a free, easy to use GUI application for working with MSAs.

  Features
  - Simple and intuitive graphical user interface (no LDAP or powershell knowledge required)
  - Quick and easy to create and assign new MSAs, as well as removing old MSAs
  - Create and configure Group Managed Service Accounts introduced in Windows Server 2012
  - Install and uninstall MSAs on remote computers
  - Configure properties of existing MSAs, including the ability to disable them, set their expiry date, add them to groups, modify SPNs, and more
  - Uses native Windows APIs and LDAP operations where possible instead of Powershell for improved performance
  - Multi-domain friendly, simply enter the domain name (and credentials) for any domain you want to manage MSAs on
