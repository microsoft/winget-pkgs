ShortDescription: A simple tool that allows helpdesk technicians or non admin users to quickly unlock and reset passwords for user accounts without having to use the full AD Users & Computers MMC tool (assuming they have been delegated the required permissions).
Description: |-
  In many organizations IT administrators regularly need to unlock user accounts or reset passwords, but doing this through Active Directory Users & Computers MMC snap-in can be time consuming (or confusing for non IT staff that are not familiar with Active Directory but still need to reset other user's passwords). This tool was designed to provide a simple and intuitive tool for them to perform these actions with.

  Features
  - Simple and intuitive GUI
  - Unlock accounts
  - Reset passwords
  - Force password to be changed on next logon
  - Enable/Disable accounts
  - Set account expiration date
  - Multi-domain friendly - specify any domain and optionally use alternate credentials to connect to it
  - Settings can be controlled via Group Policy
