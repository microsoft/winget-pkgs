ShortDescription: Locates services and scheduled tasks running as a specific account across all servers in your domain and automates the task of updating them to use new credentials
Description: |-
  When it comes to changing an admin or service account password there is almost always at least one service or scheduled task that is only discovered when the service stops working after the password change, so this tool was developed to help make sure you have discovered every single one and it can also update the password on each of them remotely for you.

  The free edition is provided in the hope that it is useful to fellow IT Pros, it is not intended to just be a trial/demo of the standard edition (though you could use it as such if you are considering purchasing the standard edition). Whilst some features are only available in the standard edition, the free edition can still save you hours of work tracking down all the services and tasks using a specified account. See below for a summary of the features that can be found in the free edition (and the additional features in the standard edition)
  - Time Saving - Scan any number of servers to automatically find all Windows services and scheduled tasks and see who they are running as
  - Import Computers - Import a list of computers to scan from an Active Directory OU, CSV file, or manually type them in
  - Task Scheduler 2.0 Compatible - Works with Server 2008 format scheduled tasks as well as XP/2003 format
  - Intelligent - Automatically looks up alternate formats for the username you specify (i.e. searching for DOMAIN\User will also find user@domain.local)
  - Fast - Uses native Windows APIs (does not rely on WMI) and multi-threading to query multiple remote servers quickly
  - Managed Service Account Aware - Works with Managed Service Accounts, allowing you to find and update services running under MSA credentials
