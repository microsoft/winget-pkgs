ShortDescription: Query your Active Directory domain for information on several different types of objects (Users, Computers, Groups, Printers etc) using this flexible and user friendly Active Directory reporting tool.
Description: |-
  With more flexability than other Active Directory reporting tools and a modern user friendly interface, AD Info lets you easily query your Active Directory domain for the information you need. Use one of the 190+ queries that come with the application or use the custom query designer to create your own query based on any attributes you choose.

  The free edition is provided in the hope that it is useful to fellow IT Pros, it is not intended to just be a trial/demo of the standard edition (though you can use it as such if you are considering purchasing the standard edition). It is completely free for personal and commercial use and is not time limited. Whilst some features are only available in the standard edition, hopefully the fact that it still has over 190 predefined queries and can export results to CSV will mean it is the most useful free active directory reporting tool around. See below for a summary of the features that can be found in the free edition (and the standard edition)
  - Powerful - Query a huge number of attributes on Computers, Contacts, Containers/OUs, Groups, GPOs, Printers, and Users
  - Fast - Retrieving only the attributes you are interested in and using intelligent caching helps make this one of the fastest AD reporting tools available
  - Useful - Easily query several attributes that are not included in many other similar tools, such as direct and nested group membership
  - Accurate - AD Info will query each DC in the domain to get accurate values for any non-replicated attributes (Last Logon etc)
  - User Friendly - Designed to be easy to use and modern, you can be running your first query within seconds of launching AD Info for the first time
  - Flexible - Instead of having hard coded values like "Members of Domain Admins", AD Info lets you specify any group (see screenshots)
  - Secure - Uses encryption for regular LDAP queries and includes an option to use SSL (LDAPS)
  - Exportable - Export any query results to CSV file for use in other processes and reports
  - Multi-Domain Friendly - Correctly identifies group membership across trusted domains and child domains (also works from a non domain machine)

ReleaseNotes: |-
  The application now runs on .NET Framework 4.8 instead of .NET Framework 3.5
  Added built in queries for computers running Windows 11 and Windows Server 2025
  Added an option to use LDAPS instead of LDAP, which uses port 636 with SSL encryption
  When using plain LDAP (not LDAPS) connections now use "signing and sealing" so network traffic will still be encrypted in most scenarios
  Errors encountered during Global Catalog searches for universal group membership will now be shown in the query progress window instead of only in debug logs
  Improved command line help
  Performance improvements
  Free edition can now be directly upgraded to standard edition without requiring a separate installation
