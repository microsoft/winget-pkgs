ShortDescription: A user friendly program for uploading photos into a user's (or contact's) thumbnailPhoto attribute in Active Directory. The images in this attribute are used by Outlook 2010 and several other new Microsoft products to display images of users.
Description: |-
  Outlook 2010, Lync, and Sharepoint can display a photo for each user account or contact in Active Directory but includes no way to upload images into the "thumbnailPhoto" Active Directory attribute that is used to store these images other than the command line tools included with Exchange 2010. AD Photo Edit is a user friendly application designed to make it easy to upload, edit, and export these images.

  Free Edition Features
  - Quick and easy way to view existing images for any number of users or contacts, with the option to limit search results by OU and other attributes
  - Export any existing images to JPG file
  - Remove existing images
  - Upload new images to user accounts or contacts in your domain (or specify an alternate domain to connect to)
  - Easily rotate, resize and adjust the quality of images before uploading them
  - Does not limit images to being less than 10 KB in size like the Exchange 2010 command line tools
  - Works with all versions of Exchange Server
  - Choose to upload to the thumbnailPhoto attribute (used by Outlook & Lync) or jpegPhoto attribute (used by third party applications)
