ShortDescription: A user friendly program for uploading photos into a user's (or contact's) thumbnailPhoto attribute in Active Directory. The images in this attribute are used by Outlook 2010 and several other new Microsoft products to display images of users.
Description: |-
  Outlook 2010, Lync, and Sharepoint can display a photo for each user account or contact in Active Directory but includes no way to upload images into the "thumbnailPhoto" Active Directory attribute that is used to store these images other than the command line tools included with Exchange 2010. AD Photo Edit is a user friendly application designed to make it easy to upload, edit, and export these images.

  Bulk Edition Features
  - All of the features found in the Free Edition
  - Import images to Users or Contacts in bulk, using either CSV File or Named Images import methods
  - Resize images and adjust their quality as they are imported in bulk
  - Export images from Users or Contacts in bulk, with the option to only export images from accounts in a specified OU
  - Command line support for bulk imports

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Fixed a bug that caused a bulk import to incorrectly skip user accounts if the "only import photo if account does not have a photo" option was selected and the photo attribute was set to jpegPhoto
  Fixed a bug that caused the program to ignore the selected photo attribute name (thumbnailPhoto or jpegPhoto) when a bulk import was run from the command line
