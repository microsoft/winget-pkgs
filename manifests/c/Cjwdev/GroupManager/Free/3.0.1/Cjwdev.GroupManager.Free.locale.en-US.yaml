ShortDescription: A user friendly application that lets end users edit the members of any groups that they are assigned as the manager of in Active Directory.
Description: |-
  If you have ever assigned a user as a manager of a security/distribution group in Active Directory, you may have noticed the option "Manager can update membership list" which grants the user permission to add and remove members from this group. The only problem with this is that there is no easy way for the user to actually make these changes, other than through Microsoft Outlook.
  So Group Manager was designed to be an easy to use tool for end users to add and remove users/contacts/groups to any groups that they are managers of, for any organisations that do not have (or do not want to use) Microsoft Outlook for this task. It will also be useful for any organisations that are using Outlook but are moving to a hosted Exchange solution, as end users will not be able to make changes to the local domain through Outlook in this scenario.

  Features
  - No configuration required - automatically detects current user and finds only groups that they are manager of
  - Allows end users to add new members or remove existing members (users, contacts, computers, or groups) to any of the groups they manage
  - Works with groups that are managed by other groups that the user is a member of
  - User friendly and simple to use
  - Add members from other domains in your forest or from externally trusted domains
  - Control via Group Policy - control which types of objects the user can add to groups, whether or not they are allowed to remove existing members, and more
  - Export current group members to CSV file

  Free Edition Limitations
  - The free edition is intended to be used by smaller organisations where users only manage a single group, or by anyone that wants to test the application out before purchasing the standard edition. It is only able to manage a single group (if the user is a manager of more than one group then a warning will appear and they will only see the first group found) and the user is also not able to change any of the program options (manually or via Group Policy) or add new members from other domains.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  New GUI with dark theme
  Managed groups are now cached between sessions so you don't have to wait for them to be discovered again each time the program is launched
  Commonly used groups can now be "pinned" to the top of the list of managed groups
  When adding new members to groups you will now see a summary of the new member (their full name etc) before they get added to the group
  Added the option to limit searches for new members to only find results from a specific OU instead of the entire domain - this can only be set via Group Policy
  Added support for SSL over LDAP (aka LDAPS), also only configurable via Group Policy
  Added the option to view other types of group members that are not users, contacts, groups or computers (off by default but can be enabled in the settings menu)
  Any group members from trusted domains that could not be resolved to a display name will now show up in the members list, although just as a SID (assuming you have the option to view "other" member types enabled)
  Removed the Display Name column so now there is just one Name column but this can be configured via Group Policy to show the display name instead of common name
  Changed default behavior to not expand the full list of nested groups that the user is a member of when searching for managed groups, instead it will only get the user's direct group membership. The old behavior can be enabled again in the settings window or via Group Policy
  Fixed a bug that caused the error "objectSid item has already been added to dictionary" when searching for managed groups
  Settings moved from the registry to JSON files stored here: %APPDATA%\Cjwdev\GroupManager
