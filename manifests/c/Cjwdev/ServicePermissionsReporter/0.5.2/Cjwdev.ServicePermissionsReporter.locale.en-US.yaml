ShortDescription: Shows permissions assigned to Windows services in an easy to read format instead of SDDL like the built in Windows tools
Description: |-
  Using built in Windows commands such as "sc.exe /sdshow" to view the permissions set on services produces an output in SDDL format, which is not easy to read or understand. This tool provides an easy to use GUI alternative to view permissions on Windows services as well as the Service Control Manager itself.

  Features
  - Easy to use, intuitive GUI. No SDDL knowledge required!
  - Query services on the local machine or on remote machines
  - View permissions on the Service Control Manager itself (scmanager)
  - Copy the SDDL format of any service's permissions to your clipboard, for use with other tools
  - More features coming in full release after BETA
