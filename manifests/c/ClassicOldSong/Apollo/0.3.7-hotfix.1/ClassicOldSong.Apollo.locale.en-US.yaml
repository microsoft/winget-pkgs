  - Supports export .art files in WebUI,

  Warning
  BREAKING: SUNSHINE_CLIENT_FPS is now float for better fractional refresh rate support. Use Special-K and ApolloProfileManager for automatic, client independent fps limit with Apollo.
  Bonus
  Apollo Profile Manager
  You can use it to automatically save/restore a selection of files for each app, and they're separated for each client. You can use it to swap game settings, mod sets or even save files based on the client, so you don't need to edit game resolution/keymap/modsets every time you change to a different client.

  Warning
  It is highly recommend to remove any other virtual display solutions from your system and Apollo/Sunshine config, to reduce confusions and compatibility issues.
  Remember to quit Apollo before upgrading.
