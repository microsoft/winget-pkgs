ShortDescription: Sunshine fork - The easiest way to stream with the native resolution of your client device.
Description: |-
  Apollo is a self-hosted desktop stream host for Artemis(Moonlight Noir). Offering low latency,
  native client resolution, cloud gaming server capabilities with support for AMD, Intel, and
  Nvidia GPUs for hardware encoding. Software encoding is also available. A web UI is provided to
  allow configuration and client pairing from your favorite web browser. Pair from the local server
  or any mobile device.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Warning
  If you're using multiple instances to stream multiple different displays simutinuously, disable Advanced display device options!
  The upstream implementation for display topology handling and resolution automation doesn't support multi instance well. They may end up messing up everything unexpectedly.
  If you only need one Apollo instance, it's still safe to upgrade.
  Don't forget to remove display_device.state from Apollo's config dir if it exists.
  Change log
  - v0.2.8-alpha.1
  1. Primary display can now set automatically
  2. Preserve previous log when Apollo restarts
  3. Adapt display config handling to libdisplaydevice
  4. Track upstream
  - v0.2.8-alpha.2
  1. Revert back to original HDR workaround
  2. Update libcurl, fixes #235
  - v0.2.8-alpha.3
  1. Hash cookies for Web UI
  2. Track upstream
     - Inverse polarity for Global Prep Commands for apps (bug from some unnecessary upstream changes)
     - Display config reverting logic refine (not really necessary for Apollo actually, but the new display config handling mechanism caused some display flickering on and off issues on some systems, this change might have fixed the problem)
     - Security patch (but it's already patched in Apollo in another way when I discovered the other security vulnberity long ago)
  - v0.2.8-alpha.4 & v0.2.8-alpha.5
  1. Fix bug where output_name did not take effect
  2. Fix all deactivated display are enabled when quitting virtual display

  Nope, there're more hidden problems...
  If you encounter display being toggled on and off constantly while using the latest versions, first quit Apollo (you can access the web UI from another device, by enter https://your.host.ip.address:[webuiPort] to your browser, then in Troubleshooting page tap Quit Apollo), then go to Apollo's install dir, under config dir remove display_device.state.
  Warning
  It is highly recommend to remove any other virtual display solutions from your system and Apollo/Sunshine config, to reduce confusions and compatibility issues.
