  It's very complicated to explain why HDR is a total mess, and why enabling HDR makes the image appear dark/yellow. If it's your first time got HDR streaming working, and thinks HDR looks awuful, you're right, but that's not Apollo's fault, it's your device that tone mapped SDR content to the maximum of the capability of its screen, there's no headroom for anything beyond that actual peak brightness for HDR. For details, please take a look here.
  NOTE: Windows 11 24H2 broke the method for programatically setting primary display, even MultiMonitorTool fails to do so. You can still set the virtual display to default manually and Windows will remember your configuration.
  Warning
  It is highly recommend to remove any other virtual display solutions from your system and Apollo/Sunshine config, to reduce confusions and compatibility issues.
  Warning
  Quit ALL running Apollo instances before upgrading!
