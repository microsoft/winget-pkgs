  ðŸŒŸBest practices
  1. If your client support high refresh rate, always use high refresh rate. Combined with Artemis's Warp modes, this is basically a poorman's GSync/FreeSync.
  2. If some of your clients have periodic stuttering happening, check if there display refresh rate isn't actually the value you expect by going to https://www.testufo.com/refreshrate . Then you can set Display Mode Override for the client in PIN page.
  Warning
  It is highly recommend to remove any other virtual display solutions from your system and Apollo/Sunshine config, to reduce confusions and compatibility issues.
  Remember to quit Apollo before upgrading.
