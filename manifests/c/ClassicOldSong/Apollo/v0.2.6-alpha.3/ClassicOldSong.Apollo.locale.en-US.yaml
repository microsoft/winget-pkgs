  PS: Originally I wanted to fix a weird lagging issue I discovered previously with this build, but it turns out to be the AV1 encoder of nVidia behaving strange. It works fine in most cases so it's not a really big deal, but I still suggest use HEVC if you have a good network connection. If you insist of using AV1, try disable Two-pass mode and enable Spatial AQ in NVENC config tab, that would make the problem less noticable. AMD cards doesn't have this kind of issue.
  NOTE: Windows 11 24H2 broke the method for programatically setting primary display, even MultiMonitorTool fails to do so. You can still set the virtual display to default manually and Windows will remember your configuration.
  Warning
  It is highly recommend to remove any other virtual display solutions from your system and Apollo/Sunshine config, to reduce confusions and compatibility issues.
  Warning
  Quit ALL running Apollo instances before upgrading!
