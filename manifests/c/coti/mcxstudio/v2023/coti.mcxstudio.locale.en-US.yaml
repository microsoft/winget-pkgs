ShortDescription: Monte Carlo eXtreme (MCX) - Physically accurate and validated GPU ray-tracer
Description: Monte Carlo eXtreme, or MCX, is a Monte Carlo photon simulator for modeling light transport in 3D turbid media. It uses NVIDIA graphics processing units (GPUs) to simulate thousands of photons simultaneously, making it one of the fastest and most accurate photon modeling tools.
