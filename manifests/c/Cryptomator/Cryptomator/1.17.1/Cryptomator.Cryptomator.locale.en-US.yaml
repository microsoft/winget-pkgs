ShortDescription: Encryption made easy and optimized for the cloud
Description: |-
  Cryptomator provides easy-to-use, transparent, client-side encryption for your cloud.
  It protects your documents from unauthorized access and prying eyes, while you will still be able to view and edit your documents locally.
  By not requiring any registration or account and performing all encryption locally, it gives you back control over your data and ensures your privacy.
  Cryptomator is offered for all major platforms (including Android and iOS).

  Cryptomator encrypts file contents and names using the widespread industry standard AES.
  Your passphrase is protected against brute forcing attempts using scrypt.
  Additionally, directory structures get obfuscated.
  For more info about the Cryptomator encryption scheme, check out the online documentation.

  Cryptomator is a free and open-source software licensed under the GPLv3.
  This allows anyone to check our code.
  Thus, it is impossible to introduce backdoors for third parties or to hide vulnerabilities, so you do not need to trust Cryptomator.
  Also, vendor lock-ins are impossible.
  Even if we decided to stop development: The source code is already cloned by hundreds of other developers and development can be picked up by others.

  Cryptomator is provided free of charge as an open-source project despite the high development effort and is therefore dependent on support by the community.
