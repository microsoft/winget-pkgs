ShortDescription: Multi-platform transparent client-side encryption of your files in the cloud
Description: |-
  Cryptomator is a free and open-source software providing transparent, client-side encryption for your cloud.

  It encrypts file contents using GCM and file names using AES.
  Your passphrase is protected against bruteforcing attempts
  using scrypt. Directory structures get obfuscated.
  Only the modification date of your files is preserved to ensure proper
  cloud synchronization.

  Cryptomator is a free and open source software licensed under the GPLv3.
  This allows anyone to check our code.
  It
  is impossible to introduce backdoors for third parties and for us to hide vulnerabilities. And the best thing
  is: There is no need to trust us, as you can control us!

  Vendor lock-ins are impossible.
  Even if we decided to stop development: The source code is already cloned by
  hundreds of other developers. As you don't need an account, you will never stand in front of locked doors.

  Cryptomator is provided free of charge as an open-source project despite the high development effort and is therefore dependent on support by the community.
