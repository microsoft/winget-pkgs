ReleaseNotes: |-
  v2.12.4 (Kyiv) - (14/07/2022)

  Bug fixes:
  - CloudCompare 2.12.X (X<4) could miss some triangles when computing the Cloud-to-Mesh distances (resulting in slightly overestimated distances)
  - CloudCompare would still apply the Global Shift even though it was rejected by the user (which is a bad idea ;). But the entity
    Global Shift would then be (0, 0, 0), resulting in the loss of the original coordinate system.
  - the scale in the lower-right part of the 3D view could have the wrong length (if the height of the window is larger than its width)
  - FBX: CloudCompare couldn't properly load the materials (textures) of meshes with quads
  - the Compass plugin was exporting large coordinates with a too small precision
  - the command line could ignore the input global shift (set with -GLOBAL_SHIFT) if it was not sufficient
    to make the points coordinates small enough. This was not consistent with the previous behavior.
  - the segmentation tool in Perspective mode could keep points behind the camera/viewpoint
