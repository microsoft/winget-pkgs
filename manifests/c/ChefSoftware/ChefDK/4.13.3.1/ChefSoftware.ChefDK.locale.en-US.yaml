ReleaseNotes: |-
  Note: ChefDK will enter the end-of-life product phase on Dec 31st 2020. The 4.13 release of ChefDK is the last planned release and all users should upgrade to Chef Workstation, which offers significant improvements to all included tools.
  Package Updates
  ChefDK packages are no longer produced for Debian 8 and RHEL/CentOS 6, as these platforms are now both EOL.
  Updated Components
  Test Kitchen
  Test Kitchen was updated from 2.7.2 to 2.8.0. This release improves how we execute commands on Windows hosts to avoid failures from executing commands that are too long for the Windows command line. Thanks for this fix @ramereth!
  Kitchen Google
  The Kitchen Google driver for Test Kitchen was updated from 2.0.3 to 2.1.0. This release adds a new network_ip config for an IPv4 internal IP address to assign to the instance. The driver automatically assigns an unused internal IP to an unconfigured network_ip. Thanks @eReGeBe for this new feature!
  Kitchen Vagrant
  The kitchen-vagrant plugin is updated from version 1.7.1 to 1.7.2 with a bug fix to no longer stop with an error when updating a Vagrant box that hasn’t yet been downloaded.
  Kitchen Dokken
  Kitchen Dokken has been updated to 2.11.2 to resolve failures from creating containers during the Test Kitchen converge. Thanks for reporting this issue @emeshuris!
  Chef InSpec
  Chef InSpec has been updated to 4.24.8, which includes the following improvements:
  - An unset HOME environment variable won’t cause execution failures
  - You can use wildcards in platform-name and release in InSpec profiles. Thanks for this improvement @yarick!
  - The WMI resource now returns an array to support returning multiple WMI objects
  - The package resource on Windows properly escapes package names. Thanks for this improvement @ramereth!
  - The grub_conf resource succeeds even if without a menuentry in the grub config
  - Loaded plugins won’t try to re-load themselves
  - Waiver expiration is now always populated
  chef-vault
  Chef Vault has been updated to version 4.1, which properly handles escape strings in secrets and greatly improves performance for users with large numbers of secrets. Thanks for the performance work @Annih!
  knife-ec2
  The knife-ec2 plugin has been updated to 2.1.0, which allows for the creation of instances with ST1 or SC1 EBS volume types
  Security
  openSSL
  The openSSL library has been updated to 1.0.2x to resolve CVE-2020-1971.
