ShortDescription: An agent that runs locally on every node that’s under management by Chef Infra Server.
Description: |-
  Chef Infra Client is an agent that runs locally on every node that’s under management by Chef Infra Server. When Chef Infra Client runs, it performs all of the steps required for bringing a node into the expected state, including:
  - Registering and authenticating the node with Chef Infra Server
  - Synchronizing cookbooks from the Chef Infra Server to the node
  - Compiling the resource collection by loading each of the required cookbooks, including recipes, attributes, and all other dependencies
  - Taking the appropriate and required actions to configure the node based on recipes and attributes
  - Reporting summary information on the run to Chef Automate
  Chef Infra Client authenticates with the Chef Infra Server using RSA public key-pairs each time a Chef Infra Client needs access to data that is stored on the Chef Infra Server. This prevents any node from accessing data that it shouldn’t and it ensures that only nodes that are properly registered with the Chef Infra Server can be managed.
ReleaseNotes: |-
  Improvements
  - Chef Infra Client has improved performance when building large arrays of cookbooks. Thanks @dafyddcrosby! #15274
  - We updated knife-ec-backup to include cookbooks with a frozen status. Before, this led to Chef Infra Server upgrades that didn't include frozen cookbooks. #15217
  Resource updates
  - We fixed the ohai resource where a nil value could be assigned to the plug-in path in the reload action. #15229
  - We fixed a bug in the chocolatey_installer resource that always downloaded the installer from Choco and ignored the custom URL option. #15306
  - We updated the apt_repository resource with the following changes:
    - apt_repository now correctly handles an array of key URLs in the key property when signed_by is true (the default).
    - If you invoke apt_repository more than once with the same key URL, later instances of apt_repository now correctly import their keys. Before, only the first instance would have its key imported.
    - apt_repository can now handle GPG key imports on Debian version 13/Trixie.
    #15235
  Packaging
  - We aren't releasing an AIX package for this release.
  - We added a software bill of materials (SBOM) to all builds. #15317 #15319
  - We removed old .NET version 5 DLL files from the build. We now use .NET 8 and these files now come directly from the chef-powershell gem. #15190
  - We added Black Duck workflows to scan for security vulnerabilities. #15093
  Security
  - We updated the activesupport gem to address CVE-2023-22796. #15298
