ShortDescription: An agent that runs locally on every node that’s under management by Chef Infra Server.
Description: |-
  Chef Infra Client is an agent that runs locally on every node that’s under management by Chef Infra Server. When Chef Infra Client runs, it performs all of the steps required for bringing a node into the expected state, including:
  - Registering and authenticating the node with Chef Infra Server
  - Synchronizing cookbooks from the Chef Infra Server to the node
  - Compiling the resource collection by loading each of the required cookbooks, including recipes, attributes, and all other dependencies
  - Taking the appropriate and required actions to configure the node based on recipes and attributes
  - Reporting summary information on the run to Chef Automate
  Chef Infra Client authenticates with the Chef Infra Server using RSA public key-pairs each time a Chef Infra Client needs access to data that is stored on the Chef Infra Server. This prevents any node from accessing data that it shouldn’t and it ensures that only nodes that are properly registered with the Chef Infra Server can be managed.
ReleaseNotes: |-
  New features
  - We added support for recipes in JSON format. This builds on earlier work that allows you to define recipes in YAML. This provides a low-code syntax for simple use cases. To write recipes in JSON, Chef resources and any user-defined parameters can be added as elements in a resources object, such as the example below:
    {
          "resources": [
              {
                  "type": "package",
                  "name": "httpd"
              },
              {
                  "type": "template",
                  "name": "/var/www/html/index.html",
                  "source": "index.html.erb"
              },
              {
                  "type": "service",
                  "name": "httpd",
                  "action": [
                      "enable",
                      "start"
                  ]
              }
          ]
      }
    Thanks dafyddcrosby! (#15106)
  Compliance Phase improvements
  - We updated the inspec-core and train-core gems. (#15042)
  Resource updates
  - We added the environment property to the apt_package, dnf_package, dpkg_package, package, rpm_package, and yum_package resources. This allows you to customize package installation using environment variables for packages that don’t use preseed files.
    For example:
    apt_package "percona-xtradb-cluster-server" do
        environemnt({"PERCONA_TELEMETRY_DISABLE" => "1"})
    end
    Thanks kristofvandam! (#15091)
  - We fixed an idempotency bug when dearmoring keys in the apt_repository resource. (#15056)
  - We fixed a bug with the apt_repository resource where it was erroneously accepting empty keys. (#15043)
  Bug fixes
  - We fixed a bug in the irb prompt that caused the cursor to jump. (#15069)
  - We fixed a bug where Chef Infra Client was not handling Ohai custom plug-ins correctly. The plug-in name would return an Ohai::Exceptions::AttributeNotFound error. (#15115)
  - We fixed the error NoMethodError: undefined method 'present?' for nil:NilClass when running knife bootstrap. (#15108)
  Packaging
  - We now build packages for Ubuntu 24.04 on x86-64 and ARM64 platforms and no longer support packages for Ubuntu 16.04. (#15062)
  - We now build packages for Windows Server 2025 on x86_64 platforms. (#15165)
