ReleaseNotes: |-
  Components
  Knife
  Important Notice: Upcoming Omnitruck API Deprecation
  We updated Knife from v18.6.2 to v18.6.13. This release introduces a warning message when running knife bootstrap that notifies users about the upcoming Omnitruck API deprecation.
  To ensure uninterrupted downloads and remove this warning:
  - For connected environments: Activate your Chef license and Knife automatically uses the new download APIs.
  - For air-gapped environments: Set up a local Chef licensing service and configure the CHEF_LICENSE_SERVER environment variable to point to its URL. For more information, see the Chef Local License Service documentation.
  Activating your Chef license ensures a smooth transition to the new download mechanism before the Omnitruck API is deprecated.
  Chef Habitat
  - Updated Chef Habitat from v1.6.1041 to v1.6.1243. See the Habitat release notes for more information.

  - To improve security and mitigate vulnerabilities, we replaced Kernel.open with File.open and IO.read with File.read.
