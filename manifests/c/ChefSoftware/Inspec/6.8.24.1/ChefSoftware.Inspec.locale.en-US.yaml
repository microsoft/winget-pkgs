ShortDescription: An open-source framework for testing and auditing your applications and infrastructure.
Description: |-
  Chef InSpec is an open-source framework for testing and auditing your applications and infrastructure. It compares the actual state of your system with the desired state that you express in easy-to-read and easy-to-write Chef InSpec code. It detects violations and displays findings in the form of a report, but puts you in control of remediation.
  Chef InSpec is a run-time framework and rule language used to specify compliance, security, and policy requirements. It includes a collection of resources that help you write auditing controls quickly and easily.

  New Features
  - Deprecation notice about moving core resource packs to their individual gems after the next major release (#7219)
  - Added the --legacy flag to the inspec automate upload command. (#7200)
    The inspec automate upload command runs inspec check and inspec export, which were updated in Chef InSpec 5.22.36. This update led to a bug with InSpec profiles with =begin =end.
    Use the --legacy flag with profiles where the newer export and check methods may fail to parse older profiles correctly, particularly due to limitations in AST parsing.
