ShortDescription: Couchbase is a document-oriented NoSQL database
Description: The Community Edition (CE) is best for noncommercial developers where basic availability, performance, scale, tooling, security capabilities and community support is sufficient. CE comes free and there are no constraints on using these binaries in production systems. However, CE is not subjected to the iterative test, fix, and verify quality assurance cycle that is a part of the Enterprise Edition release process. The release version of CE is several months behind EE. CE also does not include the latest bug fixes. Documentation, mailing lists, and forums provide support for the Couchbase user community to help troubleshoot issues and answer questions. CE comes with limited concurrency and parallelism and supports a maximum of 4 cores per node.
