ShortDescription: Pawn is a quick and small scripting language that requires few resources.
Description: Pawn is a simple, typeless, 32-bit extension language with a C-like syntax. The Pawn compiler outputs P-code (or bytecode) that subsequently runs on an abstract machine. Execution speed, stability, simplicity and a small footprint were essential design criterions for both the language and the abstract machine.
