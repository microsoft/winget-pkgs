ReleaseNotes: |-
  Changes compared to previous Release
  Changes compared to previous release version (v0.26):
  Twitch is turning off the PubSub API, so all features that relied on it had to be replaced with EventSub (e.g. Mod Actions, AutoMod and more). You will need to reconnect your Twitch Account under "Main - Account" due to the new API requiring new access scopes. Channel Points Redemptions are only available for the broadcaster in the new API and haven't been implemented in Chatty yet.
