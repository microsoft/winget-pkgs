ReleaseNotes: |-
  Changes compared to previous Release
  Changes compared to previous release version (v0.25):
  Custom Tabs
  Custom Tabs allow you to route message from regular channels to a Custom Tab based on Highlight matching rules.
  The new to: prefix (for Highlights, Ignore, Msg. Colours and the new Routing setting) specifies the name of the Custom Tab you want to route the matching messages to. For example adding to:Mentions regw:yourname to the Custom Tabs Routing list will copy all messages containing the word "yourname" to a tab called "Mentions".
  There are also options to copy the text of Desktop Notifications to a Custom Tab, logging Custom Tab messages to a file and more.
  Message History
  Added a message history on channel join, which can be enabled in the Settings under "History". It can show regular chat messages from the last 24h for many channels based on the recent-messages.robotty.de API.

  Added an "M" button to the input field that opens a panel for changing channel modes (available only for moderators).
