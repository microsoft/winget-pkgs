ReleaseNotes: |-
  Interva is now officially supported on Linux and macOS too!
  For MacOS:
  - Download the .dmg file
  - If you're having trouble installing it (which you likely will, since the app isn't signed with a developer license), try running the following command:
  - sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine "/Users/(your username)/Downloads/interva_1.2.0_aarch64.dmg" (replace 'your username' with your actual macOS username)
  For Windows:
  - Download the .msi file
  - Run the file. If the Windows Defender pops up, click on 'more info' and then on 'run anyway'. Additionally, if that doesn't work, try temporarily disabling the Windows antivirus real-time protection.
  Linux users, I trust you to figure it out, you use Linux for a reason
