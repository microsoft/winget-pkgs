  - Support for rev M+ hardware (excluding Python coprocessor), by @jacobly0 and @calc84maniac.
  - Major LCD emulation improvements, by @calc84maniac.
  - Major watchdog timer rewrite based on hardware research, by @calc84maniac.
  - Prepare future Python-related features, by @jacobly0 and @calc84maniac (SPI, UART...)
  - Big endian support, by @calc84maniac
  - Make keypress emulation thread-safe, by @calc84maniac

  - Add some debugging features for TI-Basic (step-by-step execution, live variable preview etc.)
  - Fix name of a few OS variables in some cases (some were labeled Ans, formula lists support...)
  - Fix crash upon trying to export natural keymap (you can't)
