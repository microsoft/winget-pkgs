ShortDescription: Cppcheck is a static analysis tool for C/C++ code.
Description: |-
  Cppcheck is a static analysis tool for C/C++ code.
  Unlike C/C++ compilers and many other analysis tools it does not detect syntax errors in the code.
  Cppcheck primarily detects the types of bugs that the compilers normally do not detect.
  The goal is to detect only real errors in the code (i.e. have zero false positives).

ReleaseNotes: |-
  - uselessOverride finds overriding functions that either duplicate code from or delegate back to the base class implementation
  - knownPointerToBool finds pointer to bool conversions that are always true or false
  - truncLongCastAssignment and truncLongCastReturn check additional types, including float/double/long double
  - duplInheritedMember also reports duplicated member functions
  - constParameter/constVariable checks find more instances of pointers/references that can be const, e.g. when calling library functions
  - Show in statistics which checkers have been activated in latest analysis
  - Make it more visible if there has been critical errors that caused checkers to be skipped
  - Write how many checkers was activated after a run
  - Added --checkers-report that can be used to generate a report in a file that shows what checkers was activated and disabled
  - The qmake build system has been deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
  - Command-line option '--template <template>' is deprecated and will be removed in 2.13 - please use '--template=<template>' instead.
  - Command-line option '--template-location <template>' is deprecated and will be removed in 2.13 - please use '--template-location=<template>' instead.
  - "USE_QT6=On" will no longer fallback to Qt5 when Qt6 is not found.
  - When the execution of an addon fails with an exitcode it will now result in an 'internalError' instead of being silently ignored.
  - "Win32" configurations have been removed from the bundled Visual Studio solution and projects.
    You might still be able to build 32-bit binaries using CMake but that is untested and unmaintained.
