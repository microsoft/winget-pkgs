ReleaseNotes: |-
  2.5.5 Chia blockchain 2025-08-19
  Note that protocol changes between node, farmer, and harvester will require all entities to be upgraded
  at the same time to 2.5.5. On a simple one machine setup, this will be handled by the installer.
  But if you have more complicated topologies with remote farmers or harvesters, you will need to upgrade
  all components.
  2.5.5 will also make changes to the blockchain database that are incompatible with previous versions. If you
  run 2.5.5 but later wish to downgrade to an earlier version, you will need to downgrade your database schema by
  running the following command:
  python -c "import sqlite3, sys, os; conn = sqlite3.connect(os.path.expanduser(sys.argv[1])); cursor = conn.execute('UPDATE coin_record SET spent_index = 0 WHERE spent_index = -1'); print(f'Updated {cursor.rowcount} records'); conn.commit(); conn.close()" <path to the db>
  Replacing <path to the db> with your actual database path.
  What's Changed
  Added
  - Add chia dev mempool CLI commands to import, export, and benchmark the mempool
  - Add new error logging if the block cost fails to compute
  - Add dicts to streamable
  - Add independant Full Node RPC Validation Tool (tools\validate_rpcs.py)
  - Add Revocable CAT support to wallet (Chip 38)
  - Add mempool optimizations and fixes in spend deduplication and singleton fast forward.
  - Add mempool vault fast forward support
  - Add unit tests to cover singleton fast forward dynamics
  - Add new optional block creation algorithm to maximize transactions (set config.yaml full_node:block_creation to 1)
  - Add new config setting for block creation timeout (full_node:block_creation_timeout)
  - Add preparation for new plot format and expected hard fork (Chip 48)
  - Add canonical CLVM serialization requirement after expected hard fork
  Changed
  - Harvester<->Farmer protocol change: compute plot filter on the harvester (Chip 48 prep)
  - Farmer<->Node protocol change (Chip 48 prep)
  - Backwards incompatible schema change for mempool fast-forward support
  - Remove problematic coins_added_at_height_cache cache
  - Remove no longer needed item_inclusion_filter in the mempool
  - Significantly speedup mempool manager tests by not forcing them to request unneeded fixtures
  - Refactor and add test for WSM puzzle hash endpoints
  - Removed unneeded call to compute block cost
  - Add puzzle hash generation to action scopes
  - Remove direct secret key access from pool wallet
  - Add ContextManager to FullNodePeers
  - Simplify DB checks in invariant_check_mempool
  - log how long it took to call peak_post_processing_2
  - move chia.types.aliases to chia.server.aliases
  - move tx processing queue entry classes
  - Improve the serialisation of AddressManager
  - Remove the dependency of chia.consensus on the module chia.types
  - Adapt test_check_removals_with_block_creation to cover both block generator creation versions
  - Use upstream miniupnpc 2.3.3
  - Don't return addition coin records in CoinStore's new_block
  - Avoid recomputing coin record names in rollback_to_block when we have access to them
  - move sp broadcast outside of blockchain mutex
  - use pyproject.toml [project] section (again)
  - Simplify test_set_spent
  - Leverage execute_fetchall in CoinStore's rollback_to_block

  - Extract _add_coin_records out of CoinStore and simplify it
  - Simplify test_num_unspent
  - Simplify test_basic_coin_store
  - Optimize rolled back state construction in _reconsider_peak

  - Port NFT, pooling, DID, and Datalayer RPCs to @marshal decorator
  - Simplify SpendSim's farm_block
  - Migrate away from clvm imports
  - Pass coin IDs from Blockchain's _reconsider_peak to CoinStore's new_block to avoid recomputing them
  - Unify fork peak and reward coins handling between ForkInfo's include_spends and include_block
  - Replace CATWallet.create_new_cat_wallet in test_cat_wallet.py
  - Change minimium node version to 20 and npm version to 10
  - Timelord: dont skip same peak if in unfinished cache
