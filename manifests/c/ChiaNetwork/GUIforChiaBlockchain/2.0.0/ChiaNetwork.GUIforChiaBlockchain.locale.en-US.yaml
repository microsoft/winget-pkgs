ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Bladebit 3.0 release - Create compressed K32 plots using ramplot or the new GPU plotting cmmand, cudaplot, to increase your effective space and earn more farming rewards
  - C1 to C7 compression levels are supported, see here to understand how much compression you are getting at each level
  - 256GB minimum RAM support when using a GPU, or 416GB minimum RAM support when using a CPU. NVIDIA GPU with 8GB* of VRAM, CUDA capability of 5.2 (1 series cards and up).
  - Supported on Windows and Linux
  - Plot from the GUI or from the CLI
  - Existing uncompressed plots will still continue to work
  - GPU harvesting of compressed plots (decompression) with NVIDIA cuda GPUs, farm compressed plots with high efficiency (multiple petabytes on a single GPU).
  - CPU harvesting (decompression) for levels C1-C7, although up to C5 is recommended for most CPU farmers
  - Chia GUI updates for farming
  - The farm tab has been updated with farm health statistics to easily identify network, pool, or plot issues.
  - Added a Harvester tab for GUI users to now see the amount of raw and effective space each harvester is managing as well as report on local and remote harvester latency and plot information.
    This is critical information for farming compressed plots!
  - New harvester settings page, including compression support, and recursive plot scan to support subdirectories.
  - Plot filter reduction hard fork has been introduced due to plotting speeds increasing with the introduction of GPU plotting, and to discourage plot grinding attempts.
    The first reduction for plot filters will kick in at block 5,496,000 (around June 2024) and lower the filter from 512 to 256.
    Thereafter, the filters will be reduced by half every three years.
    More details can be found in our blog post on GPU plotting.
  - CLVM BLS additions through a soft fork
  - New BLS operators to supplement point_add functionality to enable more complex CLVM performance, including signature verification and the use of zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs
  - Operators for calculating a remainder through the addition of "modpow" and "%" in CLVM
  - Adding operator support for secp256k1 and secp256r1 signatures to support using HSMs, hardware wallet, Apple Secure Enclave, and Android's Keystore trusted execution environment as signing devices
  - Transition to BLST library to get performance gains in full nodes when validating and submitting transactions
  - Local address book has been added so you can save commonly used addresses, DIDs, or domains against a contact that can be used when creating a transaction or more easily identify past transactions.
    The address book is shared across all local keys on the same computer to reduce having to keep duplicate copies.
  - Added a get_wallet_address RPC to enable developers to derive wallet addresses from any point in the wallet keyspace for any of the user's keys making it easier to get a specific wallet address along a derivation path for a specific key
  - WalletConnect API updates
  - Clawback commands have been added so DApps can initiate clawback commands to any connected wallet
  - Get wallet address commands have also been added
  - 2.0.0 is the last Chia update to officially support the v1 full node database.
    All users are recommended to upgrade to v2 database in order to support future updates.
  - Python 3.7 is no longer supported with this release.
    If you are running Ubuntu 18.04, you may need to manually update your Python version.
  - This release is the last Chia update to support macOS 10.14 Mojave, macOS 10.15 Catalina.
    Future updates will only support macOS 11 Big Sur or higher.
  - This release no longer supports Windows 8.1.
    This and future updates will only support Windows 10 or higher.
  - Offer files created on 1.6.2 or older Chia clients are no longer supported
