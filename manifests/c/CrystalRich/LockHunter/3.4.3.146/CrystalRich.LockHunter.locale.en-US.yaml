ReleaseNotes: |-
  New version of LockHunter is available! We have added support of high DPI displays, the portable version and fixed some bugs.

  Support of high DPI
  The previous version of the program displayed blurry dialogs when you work on a monitor with high DPI.
  The newer version supports non standard DPI and the UI should look crisp.

  Portable version
  Per many user requests we have added a portable edition of LockHunter. It’s also supplied in the form of installer but it allows to install the program to an external drive (or even to a cloud drive) and then use it on any computer. The portable version stores its settings in a configuration file (rather than the registry) and save log file to the folder of its executable. It doesn’t have an integration to Windows Explorer and as installable version requires administrative permissions. It will run on both Windows 64 bit and 32 bit (though, there are less than 5% of our users are still on it).
  This our first experience with portable software so your suggestions or notes on how can we improve it are very welcome.

  Bugs fixed
  - An error displayed when the program was maximized on the previous start

  Update from Oct 27th, 2021
  - Bug fixed: Winget couldn’t read the program version, therefore it always displayed LockHunter requires upgrade

  How to update from the previous version?
  Just download and install the required installer over the previous version. You do not need to uninstall the previous version.
