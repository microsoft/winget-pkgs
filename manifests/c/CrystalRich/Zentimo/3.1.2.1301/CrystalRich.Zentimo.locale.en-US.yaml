ReleaseNotes: |-
  This is a small but important update, consisting of minor improvements and bug fixes.

  Improvements
  - Unable to stop dialog: ability to copy processes info to the clipboard added
  - Additional debug information is sent in user bug reports when verbose logging is enabled (dump of all system devices and user settings)
  - The ‘Display all storage devices’ option is now enabled by default
  - Launching the program a second time brings the device menu to the front instead of the main dialog (consistent with the first launch behavior)
  Bug fix
  - ‘Drive Letters’ tab in the program settings could be grayed out and locked on Win 11
  - Text in the troubleshoot service issues dialog was displayed incorrectly in English
  - Some JPEG images caused program errors when set as device icons
  - PNG images lost transparency when set as custom device icons
  - Change device image dialog didn’t preserve its dimensions
  - In some cases, the program might have prevented system shutdown
    (afterward, the program became unstable and might have displayed errors)
  - Loading settings from file might not have worked correctly – some
    settings could get duplicated, e.g., autorun settings
  - External storage devices without a drive letter weren’t displayed in the
    device menu by default (they appeared in the hidden devices section)
  - The program might not detect or display certain types of storage devices
  - Device names might not be detected for some devices
