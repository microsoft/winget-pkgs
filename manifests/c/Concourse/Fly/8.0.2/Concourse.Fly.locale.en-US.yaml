ReleaseNotes: |-
  What's Changed
  - We updated our build process to bring in newly compiled versions of the Linux container runtime dependencies (containerd, runc, CNI plugins, etc.). We grab most of these from Wolfi's APK repository. For runc, we needed a statically compiled version, so we compile that ourselves (pipeline here). The motivation for this was to clear out CVE's related to the version of Go that each of those binaries were compiled with. If you scan the Linux tarball in this release you should find no CVE's (at the time of publishing at least)
  - Fix task caches by reverting #9330 but keep using sha256 instead of sha1 by @taylorsilva #9429
    - As a side-note, you can define absolute paths for your task caches. See concourse/docs#583 for details
