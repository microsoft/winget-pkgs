  QtRvSim articles, presentations and their recordings as well as more about Computer Architectures
  courses at the Czech Technical University in Prague are presented at https://comparch.edu.cvut.cz/

  The educational VHDL RISC-V core modeled according to the QtRvSim (single cycle and 5-stage
  pipeline) has been designed by Damir Gruncl for the CTU FEE Advanced Computer Architectures course
  (RVapo VHDL sources and tested in GHDL simulation, on Xilinx Zynq and iCE-40 FPGA targets. On Zynq
  target it runs as PMSM motor control coprocessor to solve inverse and forward Clarke and Park
  transformations and other low level control (top level project). See the complete list of the OTREES
  CTU theses for more related topics.

  The online training site for QtRvSim processed assembly and C tasks evaluation has been prepared by
  Jakub Pelc https://comparch.edu.cvut.cz/online-tools/webeval/

  QtRvSim news and the evaluation web will be presented on RISC-V International Special Interest
  Group: Academia and Training meeting at October 10 2024 at 8 AM Pacific Time (5 PM CEST). The
  feedback is welcomed. I will be present on 2024 RISC-V Summit North America (October 22-23, 2024) as
  well. I will be happy to see you there and discuss teaching, Linux, RTEMS, NuttX real time topics
  and development, motion control and robotics.
