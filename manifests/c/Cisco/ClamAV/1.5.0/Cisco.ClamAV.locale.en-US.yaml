    GitHub pull request
  - Added CVD signing/verification with external .sign files.
    Freshclam will now attempt to download external signature files to accompany
    existing .cvd databases and .cdiff patch files. Sigtool now has commands
    to sign and verify using the external signatures.
    ClamAV now installs a 'certs' directory in the app config directory
    (e.g., <prefix>/etc/certs). The install path is configurable.
    The CMake option to configure the CVD certs directory is
    -D CVD_CERTS_DIRECTORY=PATH
    New options to set an alternative CVD certs directory:
    - The command-line option for Freshclam, ClamD, ClamScan, and Sigtool is
      --cvdcertsdir PATH
    - The environment variable for Freshclam, ClamD, ClamScan, and Sigtool is
      CVD_CERTS_DIR
    - The config option for Freshclam and ClamD is
      CVDCertsDirectory PATH
    Added two new APIs to the public clamav.h header:
    cl_error_t cl_cvdverify_ex(
        const char *file,
        const char *certs_directory,
        uint32_t dboptions);
    cl_error_t cl_cvdunpack_ex(
        const char *file,
        const char *dir,
        const char *certs_directory,
        uint32_t dboptions);
    The original cl_cvdverify and cl_cvdunpack are deprecated.
    Added a cl_engine_field enum option CL_ENGINE_CVDCERTSDIR.
    You may set this option with cl_engine_set_str and get it with
    cl_engine_get_str, to override the compiled in default CVD certs directory.
    Thank you to Mark Carey at SAP for inspiring work on this feature with an
    initial proof of concept for external-signature FIPS compliant CVD signing.

  - Freshclam, ClamD, ClamScan, and Sigtool: Added an option to enable FIPS-like
    limits disabling MD5 and SHA1 from being used for verifying digital signatures
    or for being used to trust a file when checking for false positives (FPs).
    For freshclam.conf and clamd.conf set this config option:
    FIPSCryptoHashLimits yes
    For clamscan and sigtool use this command-line option:
    --fips-limits
    For libclamav: Enable FIPS-limits for a ClamAV engine like this:
    cl_engine_set_num(engine, CL_ENGINE_FIPS_LIMITS, 1);
    ClamAV will also attempt to detect if FIPS-mode is enabled. If so, it will
    automatically enable the FIPS-limits feature.
    This change mitigates safety concerns over the use of MD5 and SHA1 algorithms
    to trust files and is required to enable ClamAV to operate legitimately in
    FIPS-mode enabled environments.
    Note: ClamAV may still calculate MD5 or SHA1 hashes as needed for detection
    purposes or for informational purposes in FIPS-enabled environments and when
    the FIPS-limits option is enabled.
    GitHub pull request
  - Upgraded the clean-file scan cache to use SHA2-256 (prior versions use MD5).
    The clean-file cache algorithm is not configurable.
    This change resolves safety concerns over the use of MD5 to trust files and
    is required to enable ClamAV to operate legitimately in FIPS-mode enabled
    environments.

    GitHub pull request #2
  - ClamD: Added an option to disable select administrative commands including
    SHUTDOWN, RELOAD, STATS and VERSION.
    The new clamd.conf options are:
    EnableShutdownCommand yes
    EnableReloadCommand yes
    EnableStatsCommand yes
    EnableVersionCommand yes

    GitHub pull request
  - libclamav: Added extended hashing functions with a "flags" parameter that
    allows the caller to choose if they want to bypass FIPS hash algorithm limits:
    cl_error_t cl_hash_data_ex(
        const char *alg,
        const uint8_t *data,
        size_t data_len,
        uint8_t **hash,
        size_t *hash_len,
        uint32_t flags);
    cl_error_t cl_hash_init_ex(
        const char *alg,
        uint32_t flags,
        cl_hash_ctx_t **ctx_out);
    cl_error_t cl_update_hash_ex(
        cl_hash_ctx_t *ctx,
        const uint8_t *data,
        size_t length);
    cl_error_t cl_finish_hash_ex(
        cl_hash_ctx_t *ctx,
        uint8_t **hash,
        size_t *hash_len,
        uint32_t flags);
    void cl_hash_destroy(void *ctx);
    cl_error_t cl_hash_file_fd_ex(
        const char *alg,
        int fd,
        size_t offset,
        size_t length,
        uint8_t **hash,
        size_t *hash_len,
        uint32_t flags);
    GitHub pull request
  - ClamScan: Improved the precision of the bytes-scanned and bytes-read counters.
    The ClamScan scan summary will now report exact counts in "GiB", "MiB", "KiB",
    or "B" as appropriate. Previously, it always reported "MB".
    GitHub pull request
  - ClamScan: Add hash & file-type in/out CLI options:
    - --hash-hint: The file hash so that libclamav does not need to calculate
      it. The type of hash must match the --hash-alg.
    - --log-hash: Print the file hash after each file scanned. The type of hash
      printed will match the --hash-alg.
    - --hash-alg: The hashing algorithm used for either --hash-hint or
      --log-hash. Supported algorithms are "md5", "sha1", "sha2-256".
      If not specified, the default is "sha2-256".
    - --file-type-hint: The file type hint so that libclamav can optimize
      scanning (e.g., "pe", "elf", "zip", etc.). You may also use ClamAV type names
      such as "CL_TYPE_PE". ClamAV will ignore the hint if it is not familiar with
      the specified type.
      See also: https://docs.clamav.net/appendix/FileTypes.html#file-types
    - --log-file-type: Print the file type after each file scanned.
    We will not be adding this for ClamDScan, as we do not have a mechanism in the
    ClamD socket API to receive scan options or a way for ClamD to include scan
    metadata in the response.
    GitHub pull request
  - libclamav: Added new scan functions that provide additional functionality:
    cl_error_t cl_scanfile_ex(
        const char *filename,
        cl_verdict_t *verdict_out,
        const char **last_alert_out,
        uint64_t *scanned_out,
        const struct cl_engine *engine,
        struct cl_scan_options *scanoptions,
        void *context,
        const char *hash_hint,
        char **hash_out,
        const char *hash_alg,
        const char *file_type_hint,
        char **file_type_out);
    cl_error_t cl_scandesc_ex(
        int desc,
        const char *filename,
        cl_verdict_t *verdict_out,
        const char **last_alert_out,
        uint64_t *scanned_out,
        const struct cl_engine *engine,
        struct cl_scan_options *scanoptions,
        void *context,
        const char *hash_hint,
        char **hash_out,
        const char *hash_alg,
        const char *file_type_hint,
        char **file_type_out);
    cl_error_t cl_scanmap_ex(
        cl_fmap_t *map,
        const char *filename,
        cl_verdict_t *verdict_out,
        const char **last_alert_out,
        uint64_t *scanned_out,
        const struct cl_engine *engine,
        struct cl_scan_options *scanoptions,
        void *context,
        const char *hash_hint,
        char **hash_out,
        const char *hash_alg,
        const char *file_type_hint,
        char **file_type_out);
    The older cl_scan*() functions are now deprecated and may be removed in a
    future release. See clamav.h for more details.
    GitHub pull request
  - libclamav: Added a new engine option to toggle temp directory recursion.
    Temp directory recursion is the idea that each object scanned in ClamAV's
    recursive extract/scan process will get a new temp subdirectory, mimicking
    the nesting structure of the file.
    Temp directory recursion was introduced in ClamAV 0.103 and is enabled
    whenever --leave-temps / LeaveTemporaryFiles is enabled.
    In ClamAV 1.5, an application linking to libclamav can separately enable temp
    directory recursion if they wish.
    For ClamScan and ClamD, it will remain tied to --leave-temps /
    LeaveTemporaryFiles options.
    The new temp directory recursion option can be enabled with:
    cl_engine_set_num(engine, CL_ENGINE_TMPDIR_RECURSION, 1);
    GitHub pull request
  - libclamav: Added a class of scan callback functions that can be added with the
    following API function:
    void cl_engine_set_scan_callback(struct cl_engine *engine, clcb_scan callback, cl_scan_callback_t location);
    The scan callback location may be configured using the following five values:
    - CL_SCAN_CALLBACK_PRE_HASH: Occurs just after basic file-type detection and
      before any hashes have been calculated either for the cache or the gen-json
      metadata.
    - CL_SCAN_CALLBACK_PRE_SCAN: Occurs before parser modules run and before
      pattern matching.
    - CL_SCAN_CALLBACK_POST_SCAN: Occurs after pattern matching and after
      running parser modules. A.k.a. the scan is complete for this layer.
    - CL_SCAN_CALLBACK_ALERT: Occurs each time an alert (detection) would be
      triggered during a scan.
