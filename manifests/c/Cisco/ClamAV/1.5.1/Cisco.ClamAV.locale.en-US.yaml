ReleaseNotes: |-
  ClamAV 1.5.1 is a patch release with the following fixes:
  - Fixed a significant performance issue when scanning some PE files.
  - Fixed an issue recording file entries from a ZIP archive central directory
    which resulted in "Heuristics.Limits.Exceeded.MaxFiles" alerts when using the
    ClamScan --alert-exceeds-max command line option or ClamD AlertExceedsMax
    config file option.
  - Improved performance when scanning TNEF email attachments.
  - Fixed an issue with recording metadata for OOXML office documents.
  - Fixed an issue with signature matches for VBA in OLE2 office documents.
  - Loosened overly restrictive rules for embedded file identification and
    increased the limit for finding PE files embedded in other PE files.
  - Fixed an issue with extracting some RAR archives embedded in other files.
  - Fixed an issue with calculating fuzzy hashes affecting some images by updating
    the version for several Rust library dependencies.
    - This release does not require a newer version of the Rust compiler toolchain
      than what was required for ClamAV 1.5.0.
