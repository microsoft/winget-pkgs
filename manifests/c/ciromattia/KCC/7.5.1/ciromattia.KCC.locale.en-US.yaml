  Notes
  Kindle Scribe full 2480 support is here.
  The problem: The Kindle Scribe has a height of 2480 pixels. But kindlegen's limit is 1920. So images are always a little blurry compared to native resolution.
  So how do you overcome this limitation?
  The key idea: Instead of using a standard fixed layout epub where 1 image is 1 page, instead implement the alternate fixed layout epub where you can have multiple images per page. As long as each individual image is <1920, kindlegen is no issue.
  Implementation wise, this was difficult because all the code assumed 1 image per page. If you look at the recent git commits to master, you'll see many of my commits doing an enormous refactor to account for this change.
  This took many many days between experimentation and testing, this was by far the largest feature I've ever worked on for KCC.
  If you feel generous, please consider donating on my Ko-fi! It's taken a lot of my time and energy to make KCC as good as it is today. https://ko-fi.com/eink_dude
  Quick tip: try disabling image darkening with gamma = 1.0 if you previously used auto, things are much sharper so darkening is less neccessary.
  Awesome community driven features:
  - file fusion: combine chapters into volumes!
  - set Title from ComicInfo.xml
  Apart from that, I've also added:
  - tons of bug fixes, especially for macOS 15
  - much more immersive 2 page spread handling when partially checked
  - vastly improved documentation
