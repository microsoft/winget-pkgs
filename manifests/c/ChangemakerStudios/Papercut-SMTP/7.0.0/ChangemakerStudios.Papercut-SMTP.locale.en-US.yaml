ShortDescription: The Simple Desktop Email Server
Description: "Papercut SMTP is a 2-in-1 quick email viewer AND built-in SMTP server (designed to receive messages only). Papercut SMTP doesn't enforce any restrictions how you prepare your email, but it allows you to view the whole email-chilada: body, html, headers, attachment down right down to the naughty raw encoded bits. Papercut can be configured to run on startup and sit quietly (minimized in the tray) only providing a notification when a new message has arrived."
