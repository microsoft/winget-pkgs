ShortDescription: Disk Space Analyzer for Windows
ReleaseNotes: |-
  v. 4.30 21/04/2025

  - Applications and Games section
    - Improved trace detection algorithm for applications. Files Inspector now
      accurately identifies traces and calculates the disk space occupied by Steam and
      games installed through it.
    - Added dependency detection for related applications. If a user attempts to uninstall Steam
      without first removing games installed via the platform, a warning will be displayed. This
      ensures games do not become inoperable, as they may depend on Steam’s framework
      (uninstallation must follow a reverse order: games first, then Steam).
    - Fixed duplicate applications in the list that occurred in some cases. For
      example, when AOMEI Partition Assistant was installed, a redundant entry named
      AOMEI Partition Assistant_is1, which served no purpose, would be added to the
      list.
  - When system font scaling is changed between application launches, it now
    maintains correct window proportions.
  - Bug fixed: Applications and Games section: When uninstalling COMODO Internet Security Pro, the
    standard uninstaller did not work.
