ShortDescription: Unnecessary software uninstallation tool
ReleaseNotes: |-
  v. 10.10 18/04/2025

  - Improved trace detection algorithm for applications. Soft Organizer now
    accurately identifies traces and calculates the disk space occupied by Steam
    and games installed through it.
  - Added dependency detection for related applications. If a user attempts to uninstall
    Steam without first removing games installed via the platform, a warning will be
    displayed. This ensures games do not become inoperable, as they may depend on Steam’s
    framework (uninstallation must follow a reverse order: games first, then Steam).
  - Fixed duplicate applications in the list that occurred in some сases. For
    example, when AOMEI Partition Assistant was installed, a redundant entry named
    AOMEI Partition Assistant_is1, which served no purpose, would be added to the
    list.
  - Fixed Bug: When uninstalling COMODO Internet Security Pro, the standard
    uninstaller did not work.
