ShortDescription: Explorer-like management for queues
Description: |-
  QueueExplorer supports multiple systems from the same installation, without need for additional licensing: MSMQ, Azure Service Bus, RabbitMQ, and ActiveMQ.

  With QueueExplorer you can do much more than with built-in management console - copy, move or delete messages, save and load, stress test, view and edit full message bodies (with support for XML, JSON, .Net objects...), and much more. QueueExplorer is a fast, native Windows application. 
  
  With QueueExplorer you can dig into your queues and see which message went where, whether they were correctly formatted, with correct headers and settings, etc.

  Multiple viewers are at your disposal: JSON, XML, WCF, Hex, text with different encodings.
