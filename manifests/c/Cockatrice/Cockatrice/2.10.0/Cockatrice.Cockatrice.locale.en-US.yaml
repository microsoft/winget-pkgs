  Changelog
  The Big One: Changes to how cards determine which art to use
  We've made some huge changes to how Cockatrice determines the art/printing/version of a card. Going forward, you will be able to select multiple and specific versions of printings of a card for your deck and other users will be able to see which specific version you have chosen.
  If you don't care about the nitty-gritty of how the old and new system work under the hood and just want to know how to use the new system, skip to the Printing Selector section, otherwise, read on.
  Previously, whenever you or someone else played a card, Cockatrice would only store the card's name and then use the user defined set order to fetch the "correct" set (i.e. their preferred). This local-only client driven approach has several problem:
  - You can not include multiple different versions of a card in the same deck. All versions will use the highest priority set defined by the user.
  - It is hard to mix and match sets. If a user would like a certain version of a card, they have to accept that other cards which match this set will also override lesser priority sets.
  - It is hard to keep multiple decks synchronized with your preferences. Because all set priority changes apply to all decks (your own as well as your opponents), it is very hard to consistently prefer a certain set due to the mix and match approach described above.
  - There is no way to communicate to other clients that you have chosen a different set as a priority. In essence, everyone simply sees their own favorite printings.
  Before we go any further explaining the new system, it is worth mentioning that you may simply return to this old behavior via toggling a setting (This is helpful if, for example, someone attempts to troll you by changing their preferred versions to be non-legigible.)
  Now, what have we done and how does this affect you?
  In essence, we've moved away from the set-priority-definition system and made each card keep track of which version it is. To do this, we have given each card a 'providerId' attribute, which is generated by your cards.xml's source. Maintainers of cards.xml's have different ways of assigning cards unique id's based on their properties (e.g. Card Name, Collector Number, Physical treatment [Foiling or similar]). This providerId is stored along with the set entry for a card, which allows us to differentiate the same card in different sets and even different versions within the same set. Cockatrice will attempt to resolve the providerId automatically if it has enough information to satisfy the provider's generation scheme: If the providerId is determined by the card name, set name and the collector number and Cockatrice has all these things AND Cockatrice has an entry for a card with the given card name, set name, and collector number in its card database with a providerId, it will assign the providerId from the database to the card.
  What this means is that you, as a User, simply need information like the card name, set name, and collector number (easily obtained from common deck exporting options) to import a specific version of a card into your deck.
  We have changed how the "Load from Clipboard" dialog works to reflect these changes. There is a new Checkbox to "Parse Set Name and Number (if available)". If enabled, Cockatrice will attempt resolve the Set Name and Number to a providerId and give you a definitive version of the card, which will display as that specific version to other users. When disabled, the set name, number, and providerId will not be set and the card will function according to the old system (i.e. every client locally looks up their preferred set).
  Similarly, if you add a card to your deck from the database in the deck editor, Cockatrice will add a definitive providerId version of the card to your deck based on the highest priority set in your defined set priority order. If you would now like to easily change this to a different version or edit your existing decks, read on.
  Printing Selector
  We've added a new widget to the deck editor to easily display the different versions of a card. This widget is hidden by default and must be enabled by either selecting "View -> Printing -> Visible" or by right-clicking a card in your deck and selecting "Select Printing". This will open a new docked widget in your deck editor (it may be re-arranged, popped out, or closed). When you now click a card, either in your deck or the database, this Widget will display all versions of the card that Cockatrice knows about and will allow you to add/remove the card to your deck by hovering over it and pressing the respective buttons. Versions of the card already included in your deck will not hide their buttons, to help you quickly locate the currently selected version.
  You may also sort the versions based on your set priority order, alphabetically or by release date. Additionally, you may search by set long or short name to quickly help you find your favorite printings. For each card, you may pin up to one printing as a favorite by right-clicking and selecting "Preference -> Pin Printing" which will make it always appear at the top of the list. The size of the displayed cards may be adjusted with a slider at the bottom and a collapsible navigation bar at the top allows you to hide UI elements, in case you need more space to display the versions.
  If you select a card which does not have a providerId and then add a version of it to your deck through the printing selector, Cockatrice will replace all non-providerId instances of the card in your decklist with the new definitive providerId version.
  Visual Deck Storage
  We've jazzed up the way you'll select your decks in the lobby screen and in a big way too! Replacing the previously black screen (until you actually loaded a deck) is a new screen which will display all files and folders located under your "Decks directory" (You may check where this is in the "General" tab of your settings, in the "Paths" sections) in a visual manner. Let's go through the UI elements and what they mean to you.
  First and foremost, each folder is represented by a folder widget. This folder widget contains a banner with the folder name which may be clicked to collapse/expand the folder, followed by DeckPreview widgets for all files located in that folder, and then folder widgets for all sub-folders.
  DeckPreview widgets are arguably the most exciting UI element. They will display a deck's name (if set in the deck editor, otherwise they will display the filename), the deck's banner card (once again, if set in the deck editor, otherwise the default cardback), the deck's color identities and finally, all tags that the deck is tagged with.
  It is important to note that for full compatibility with the new visual deck storage features, your decks must be in .cod format. Decks which are in .txt or any other format may not have tags applied to them or banner cards set.
  The Visual Deck Storage provides a variety of ways to filter and search for your decks. There is a versatile color filter, which may be changed to filter based on if the deck includes the selected colors or to filter on a strict match for the selected colors (Decks which include unselected colors will not match). You may also simply search by filename or sort by a variety of options (Alphabetically (Deck Name), Alphabetically (Filename), Last Modified, Last Loaded).
  Finally, we have the tagging system. If you have been previously using folders to organize your deck collection, you may want to strongly consider switching to the new tagging system. While folders are still supported, they are redundant when utilizing the new tagging system properly. The reason for this is simple: A deck may only be contained in one folder (or if you contain it in multiple folders with the use of shortcuts, it is still a hassle to manage) while a deck may have an infinite amount of tags.
