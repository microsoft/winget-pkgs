ReleaseNotes: |-
  General
  - Added option to install a browser userscript, as an alternative to copying the tracking script into the console
    - The userscript adds a DHT button to the top bar
    - The DHT button prompts for a 'connection code', which can be copied from the app
    - Pasting the connection code loads the tracking script from the app
  - Updated tracking script to work with the latest version of Discord
  - Closing the app while the database is finishing work now shows a progress dialog instead of freezing
  - Added an "Additional Thanks" section to the About dialog
