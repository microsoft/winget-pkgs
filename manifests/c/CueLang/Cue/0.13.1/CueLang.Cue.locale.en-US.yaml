ReleaseNotes: |-
  Evaluator
  The evaluator's core packages no longer depend on the golang.org/x/mod module, which was only used to format version strings.
  Fix a regression causing "cyclic field to reference" in some cases.
  Fix a regression causing closedness rules to not apply in some cases.
  Disable a minor optimization which was also causing closedness rules to not apply in some cases.
  cmd/cue
  Fix a build error triggered by changes in the upcoming Go 1.25 version, allowing v0.13 to be used further into the future.
  cue mod mirror --dry-run now works as documented; it had been left unimplemented by accident.
