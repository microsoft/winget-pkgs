ReleaseNotes: |-
  Evaluator
  Fix an evalv3 regression first introduced in v0.11.0 where the and built-in function started evaluating its arguments too eagerly, causing failures in cue def.
  Fix an evalv3 regression where closedness info could be lost when using a comprehension.
  Fix a bug where the evaluator would panic on alias cycles with dynamic fields rather than giving a good error.
  LSP
  Formatting standalone CUE files - either without a package name, or outside of a CUE module - now works correctly.
  Fix a bug where trying to use "find references" on a CUE module with nested modules would cause a hang.
  Fix a bug where resolving path roots did not work correctly in the presence of struct embeddings.
  cmd/cue
  Fix a regression in v0.15.0 where cue get go no longer skipped generating CUE files without any declarations.
  Go API
  Fix a bug in the subsume package where a struct with a pattern constraint did not subsume a closed struct with a matching field.
  Rename the bootstrap build tag used in the internal/filetypes package to cuebootstrap to avoid conflicts with build tags in other Go modules.
