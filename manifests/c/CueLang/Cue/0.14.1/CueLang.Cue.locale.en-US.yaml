  Evaluator
  Fix three more regressions where evalv3 gave cycle errors and evalv2 did not.
  Fix a regression where evalv3 was too strict with ellipses in certain situations, causing "field not allowed" regressions.
  Fix a regression where errors in optional fields were not being ignored as intended.
