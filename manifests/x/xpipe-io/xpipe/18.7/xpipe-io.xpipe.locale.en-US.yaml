Description: |-
  XPipe is a new type of shell connection hub and remote file manager that allows you to access your entire server infrastructure from your local machine.
  It works on top of your installed command-line programs and does not require any setup on your remote systems.
  So if you normally use CLI tools like ssh, docker, kubectl, etc. to connect to your servers, you can just use XPipe on top of that.

  XPipe fully integrates with your tools such as your favourite text/code editors, terminals, shells, command-line tools and more. The platform is designed to be extensible, allowing anyone to add easily support for more tools or to implement custom functionality through a modular extension system.

  It currently supports:
  - SSH connections, config files, and tunnels
  - Docker, Podman, LXD, and incus containers
  - Proxmox PVE virtual machines and containers
  - Hyper-V, KVM, VMware Player/Workstation/Fusion virtual machines
  - Kubernetes clusters, pods, and containers
  - Tailscale and Teleport connections
  - Windows Subsystem for Linux, Cygwin, and MSYS2 environments
  - Powershell Remote Sessions
  - RDP and VNC connections
