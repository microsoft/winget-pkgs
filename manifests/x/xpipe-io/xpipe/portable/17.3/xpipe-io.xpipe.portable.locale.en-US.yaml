ReleaseNotes: |-
  - Improve terminal logging quality. Terminal escapes are now better cleaned from the logs. To still have access to the raw original logs, there are now two logs written for each connection, one raw and one cleaned.
  - Rework SSH agent socket handling on Linux and macOS. You can now specify the agent socket location in the settings menu to avoid having to deal with various rc files
  - Add support for freerdp on macOS as another alternative RDP client
  - RDP connections do not use the smart resize option anymore to allow the client to change the resolution
  - Improve scaling for remmina and freerdp sessions
  - PowerShell startup failures are now handled better and do not cause multiple errors in various actions
  - Improve git sync handling and documentation for local sync repos with file:// urls
  - Fix clipboard copy sometimes causing the application to freeze
