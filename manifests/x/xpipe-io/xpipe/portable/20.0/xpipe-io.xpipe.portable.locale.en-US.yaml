ShortDescription: A brand-new shell connection hub and remote file manager
Description: XPipe is a new type of shell connection hub and remote file manager that allows you to access your entire sever infrastructure from your local machine. It works on top of your installed command-line programs that you normally use to connect and does not require any setup on your remote systems.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  AWS support
  You can now connect to your AWS systems from within XPipe. Currently, EC2 systems and S3 buckets are supported. The integration works on top of the AWS CLI, meaning that it is required to be installed on your system. The usage of the AWS CLI allows the integration to work very flexibly on any existing CLI setup if you already use the CLI. You can use any IAM access keys and authentication methods with it.
  The EC2 support works as with any other remote system in XPipe. The connections can be established via SSH with optional AWS Systems Manager (SSM) support. The SSM support allows you to also reach systems that do not have a security group configured to allow external access to the normal SSH port.
  The S3 support is available both for AWS buckets and other external buckets that are compatible with the S3 protocol. More enhancements to the performance and features of s3 file systems are planned.
  AWS
  This integration will be available in the Professional plan, but is also available for free for a month after release to iron out any issues first.
  SSH keygen
  You can now generate new SSH keys from within XPipe. The keys are generated via the installed OpenSSH ssh-keygen CLI tool, so you can be assured that the keys are generated in a cryptographically secure manner. You can generate keys with this button:
  Keygen
  This keygen right now supports RSA, ED25519, and ED25519 + FIDO2:
  Keygen
  Keys of identities can now also be automatically applied to systems, allowing you to perform a quick key rotation when needed:
  Identity Apply
  The process of changing the authentication configuration of a system is not always one simple step. So the dialog is a comprehensive overview of what is needed to apply a certain identity to a remote system, with various quick-action buttons and notes. This gives you still full manual control of what should be done and an overview of what is required prior to doing so.
  Identity Apply Dialog
  As adding new authorized identities to systems requires the public key, there is now the functionality to generate and store the public key for identities based on the existing private key:
  Public Keygen
  Tags
  You can now create and add tags to connection entries. This allows you to have a more structured workflow when filtering individual connections.

  SSH jump servers
  The jump server / gateway configuration has been reworked to make the configuration more intuitive. You can now control the jump server behaviour right at the gateway field for a connection. When a gateway is set, XPipe now defaults to using it as a jump server unless the option is explicitly disabled, which is a change from the previous version where it was the other way around.
  Jump Servers
  Tailscale
  The tailscale integration has been updated with the recent improvements that were implemented for Netbird and AWS. It no longer requires the Tailscale SSH auth and instead gives you the option to use the automatic Tailscale SSH auth or connect normally to an SSH server, which requires password / key authentication. When configuring a tailscale system, you can choose the authentication type.
  Tailscale
  Furthermore, you can now use Tailscale connection entries as the base for other types of connections, e.g. direct RDP / VNC connections.
  Split terminals
  There is now a new batch action to open multiple systems in a split terminal pane instead of individual tabs. This action is only supported for terminals that support this, which currently includes: Windows Terminal, Kitty, and WezTerm. In addition, this is also supported when using any other terminal and a terminal multiplexer like tmux or zellij.
  Split Action
  This allows you to also use a feature like broadcast mode of your terminal to type one command into multiple terminal panes at the same time.
  Split Terminal
  Group vaults
  In addition to existing team vaults with multiple users, you can now also set up team group vaults:
  Group Vaults
  They work basically the same as user vaults, only the authentication/unlock workflow differs. Each group has a shared group secret, which can automatically be retrieved in one of multiple ways like a password manager, a custom command, or a secret file. This gives organization administrators the ability to control access to connections from a central location without users having to supply any passwords themselves. You can flexibly convert existing team vaults into group vaults if needed.
