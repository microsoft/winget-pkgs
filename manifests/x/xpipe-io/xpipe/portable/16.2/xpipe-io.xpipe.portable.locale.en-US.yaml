ShortDescription: A brand-new shell connection hub and remote file manager
Description: XPipe is a new type of shell connection hub and remote file manager that allows you to access your entire sever infrastructure from your local machine. It works on top of your installed command-line programs that you normally use to connect and does not require any setup on your remote systems.

  Compose
  Several docker management platforms like portainer restrict external control of their compose projects. Instead of throwing confusing error messages, XPipe now detects if a compose project is managed by an external tool like portainer and displays this state for the compose project and prevents these external modifications. This also fixes cases where some compose projects were not listed by XPipe.
