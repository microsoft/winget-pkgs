ShortDescription: A brand-new shell connection hub and remote file manager
Description: XPipe is a new type of shell connection hub and remote file manager that allows you to access your entire sever infrastructure from your local machine. It works on top of your installed command-line programs that you normally use to connect and does not require any setup on your remote systems.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  SSH
  - The shell profile loading on Linux has been reworked with the goal of better handling the SSH agent detection
  - The SSH identity none selection will now always disable using default keys like id_rsa
  - There is now a new dialog to add a host key type to a connection if none of available ones are supported by the client
  - The support for FIDO2 SSH keys on Linux and macOS has been improved:
    - PINs are now cached by default so they only have to be entered once. Caching can be disabled in the security settings
    - User presence confirmation requests are now shown with an icon notification in XPipe
    - Fix FIDO2 keys not working with xpipe if they were already added to the SSH agent
  - You can now create all types of tunnels to VMs as well
  - The tunnel addresses now support IPv6 addresses
  - Add some more automatic recognition for some Mikrotik devices
  Other
  - There's a new option to automatically close terminals on successful exit without having to press any key
  - The custom icons now dynamically check whether the colored icon variant has enough contrast in dark mode.
    This will make icons more colorful instead of mostly using black-and-white icons in dark mode.
    You have to refresh the icons in the icon settings for this to apply.
  - There is now a confirmation prompt when erasing file contents in the file browser
  - Add support for Enpass password manager
