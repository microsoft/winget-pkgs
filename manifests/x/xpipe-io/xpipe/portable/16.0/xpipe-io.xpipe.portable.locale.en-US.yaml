ShortDescription: A brand-new shell connection hub and remote file manager
Description: XPipe is a new type of shell connection hub and remote file manager that allows you to access your entire sever infrastructure from your local machine. It works on top of your installed command-line programs that you normally use to connect and does not require any setup on your remote systems.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Terminals
  The terminal integration comes with many new features, so make sure to check out the settings menu:
  - There is now built-in support for the terminal multiplexers tmux, zellij, and screen. This is especially useful for terminals without tabbing support.
  - There is also now built-in support for custom prompts with starship, oh-my-posh, and oh-my-zsh.
  - On Windows, you now have the ability to use a WSL distribution as the terminal environment, allowing you to use the new terminal multiplexer integration seamlessly on Windows systems as well.
  Password managers
  The password manager integrations have been upgraded:
  - There is now support for KeePassXC (Thanks to @illnesse for the large contribution of this feature)
  - All password manager integrations have been reworked to work out of the box without configuration
  - There is now support to use password manager SSH agents more easily
  - The documentation site now contains setup instructions for all supported password managers
  - You can now unlock the xpipe vault with your password manager
  - Password manager requests are cached, fixing potential password manager overload issues when a lot of passwords are queried
  - The password $KEY identifier has been adapted to reflect the individual name/schema of the password key reference
  Docker
  This release introduces support for docker compose. Containers in compose projects are grouped together and can be managed all at the same time via compose project entries.
  The container state information shown is also improved, always showing the container state in combination with the system information.
  Batch mode
  There is now a batch mode available which allows you to select multiple systems via checkboxes and perform actions for the entire batch. This can include starting/stopping, automatically adding available subconnections, or running scripts on all selected systems.
  You can toggle the batch mode in the top left corner.
  SSH
  Various improvements were made to the SSH implementation:
  - The SSH gateway implementation has been reworked so that you can now use local SSH keys and other identities for connections with gateways
  - The VSCode SSH remote integration has been reworked to allow more connections it to be opened in vscode. It now supports essentially all simple SSH connections, custom SSH connections, SSH config connections, and VM SSH connections. This support includes gateways
  - There is now built-in support to refresh an SSO openpubkey with the opkssh tool when needed
  - When the SSH password is set to none, XPipe will no longer prompt for it anyway if the preferred auth failed
  - There is now the option to enable verbose ssh output to diagnose connection issues better
  - For VMs, you can now choose to not use the hypervisor host as SSH gateway and instead directly connect to the VM IP
  Category configuration
  There is now a new category configuration dialog available. You can find it by clicking on any category -> Configure. The goal of this is to unify the various available configuration options for categories, such as git sync status, color, and more.
  This was added to give finer-grained control over how and when to enable scripts on systems within the category, especially now that there is now support for terminal prompts that can be automatically installed on a system. If you have production systems in a category, you can now exclude those easily from any kind of custom scripting functionality and other modifications to not touch them at all.
  The available configuration options will also be expanded in future updates.
  Other
  - Generated connection names, e.g. VM names, will now automatically update on refresh when they were changed
  - Various speed improvements for shell operations
  - Various startup speed improvements
  - You can now launch custom scripts within XPipe with a command output dialog window without having to open a terminal
