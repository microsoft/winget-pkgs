ShortDescription: A brand-new shell connection hub and remote file manager
Description: XPipe is a new type of shell connection hub and remote file manager that allows you to access your entire sever infrastructure from your local machine. It works on top of your installed command-line programs that you normally use to connect and does not require any setup on your remote systems.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Netbird support
  You can now connect to devices in your Netbird network via SSH and your locally installed netbird command-line client.

  Legacy system support
  Up until now, the testing was done on relatively up-to-date machines that were not considered EOL. However, in practice, legacy systems are still used. With XPipe 19, the handling of older Unix-based systems has been greatly improved. As long as you can connect to a system via SSH somehow, it should work now regardless of how old the system is.
  The following things have been implemented to improve legacy system support:
  - The unsupported SSH host key / key / MAC dialog will now search for matches that the client supports as well. This is to fix situations in which a server lists crypto algorithms that are so old that a modern SSH clients doesn't even know them anymore
  - Fix file listing not working on older/limited versions of find
  - Fix various SSH timeout options being too aggressive for older versions, resulting in connect timeouts
  - Fix tar browser actions not working on older tar versions
  - Fix systems where set -u was configured breaking xpipe's shell handling
  - Fix file transfer failing on systems with non-GNU dd to work around missing fullblock option
  - Fix various commands on systems where sleep command did not accept decimals
  - Improve non-Linux Unix-based system name formatting
  - Add full recognition for AIX system versions

  HP-UX
  You are running old systems? Then feel free to test how XPipe 19 handles for you, and report anything that doesn't work yet.
  Abstract hosts and connection organization
  Up until now, the handling of systems which did not support shell connections has been limited. While you could add a direct VNC / RDP connection entry, the organization wasn't as refined as with shell-based connections. For those hosts, you can now make use of the improved handling that was added for services and VNC/RDP connections.
  Essentially, you can now specify the target address inline or choose an existing host from xpipe. XPipe will then automatically adapt the connection based on what is possible. E.g. if you want to open a web service directly on a device without shell access, e.g. some embedded device, just specify the hostname and optional gateway. You can then open the website in the browser while also having a nice grouping of various connection entries for an abstract host in case you have more connections added for the same host:
  Abstract host config
  You can also quickly convert existing connections entries like services and direct RDP/VNC connections to an abstract host entry to allow for better organization.

  SFTP support
  There is now support for systems which only support pure SFTP and no SSH shell sessions. These can be opened in the file browser as normal, although with limited functionality as there is no way to execute commands on these systems.
