ShortDescription: A brand-new shell connection hub and remote file manager
Description: XPipe is a new type of shell connection hub and remote file manager that allows you to access your entire sever infrastructure from your local machine.

  The SSH gateway setting has been adjusted again to be more clear on what it does. The documentation has also been updated. The default value has also been reverted to use gateway tunnels instead of ProxyJump again as gateway tunnels turn out to still work better than jump servers.
  Gateway choice
  Furthermore, various fixes have been implemented for SSH gateways and EC2 gateways.
