ReleaseNotes: |-
  XPipe 18 ventures into many new areas. It comes with the first cloud provider integration for Hetzner cloud to kickstart the process of integrating common cloud providers directly into XPipe. Furthermore, it comes with a new MCP server functionality to seamlessly integrate XPipe into your AI agent workflows. On top of everything, there are also many new convenience features like the network scan, multiple hostnames, SSH improvements, many bug fixes, and much more.
  MCP server
  There is now an MCP server available for XPipe which allows you to perform many actions in an agentic workflow via your favourite MCP client, for example Cursor. The MCP server feature is disabled by default has to be enabled in the MCP settings menu.

  Here is how it looks in Cursor:

  Hetzner cloud
  This release introduces support for Hetzner cloud servers via the hcloud CLI tool. You can list all your service automatically and then access them normally as SSH connections. This is the first of hopefully many integrations for cloud providers and will serve as a good proof of concept. This integration is available in the Professional plan.

  Network scan
  There is now the option to automatically search the local network for any listening SSH servers and add them automatically as new connections. This also works for remote systems and their networks.
  You can find the network scan in the newly organized menu at New -> Network scan.
