ShortDescription: A brand-new shell connection hub and remote file manager
Description: XPipe is a new type of shell connection hub and remote file manager that allows you to access your entire sever infrastructure from your local machine. It works on top of your installed command-line programs that you normally use to connect and does not require any setup on your remote systems.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Connection creation
  The connection creation / configuration dialog has been reworked to allow for a more efficient workflow. When validating a connection, the window is no longer blocked, and you can continue editing the connection or also minimize it meanwhile.
  Command rework
  The custom command entries that you can create at New -> Command have been completely reworked. You can now create runnable commands / scripts to be run in a terminal or in the background without having to depend on creating scripts.
  Remote SSH configs
  This update adds back support for SSH configs located on a remote system. You can now add entries from SSH config files by searching for available connections on a remote system. If any host is configured in the config file, it will be added automatically to XPipe.
  Network scan
  The network scan has been improved. You can now also explicitly select detected systems even when there was no listening server running on them. Furthermore, the check whether an SSH server is listening has been improved as there were a few false negatives.
  Updated names
  The names and location of SSH connections in the creation menu have been updated. There is now no longer a simple SSH connection but instead just an SSH connection.
