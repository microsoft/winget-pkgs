ReleaseNotes: |-
  This is a new major version of Xournal++ with a lot of new features, improvements, and bug fixes thanks to almost two year's worth of contributions from the community.
  Most notably a PDF text selection tool for interacting with the background PDF, geometry tools (setsquare and compass) for geometric constructions and measurements, and custom color palette support have been added. The LaTeX editor has been reimplemented using the gtksourceview library, enabling multiline input, syntax highlighting, undo/redo, word wrap, and a resizable code editor. Moreover the eraser has been rewritten to be much faster and more reliable and the rendering system has been optimized heavily, too. The file size of documents with lots of stroke data has been reduced by up to 15%. MacOS users will notice a large performance boost when drawing/writing thanks to an updated Gtk version.
  See the changelog for a full list of the changes.
