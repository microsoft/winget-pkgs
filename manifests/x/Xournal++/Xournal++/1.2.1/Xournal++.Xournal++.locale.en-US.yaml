ReleaseNotes: |-
  This is a new minor version of Xournal++ with bug fixes and improvements from the community.
  - Added a default toolbar so that the app does not start without toolbar on new installations
  - Fixed some crashes and various issues with the crash log handling
  - Added options to the command line and preferences to disable the audio system used for audio recording
  - The official release builds are now all built with gtksourceview styling for the LaTeX tool and in "RelWithDeb" mode. Thus failing asserts do not result in a crash anymore.
  See the changelog for a full list of the changes.
