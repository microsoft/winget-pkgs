ReleaseNotes: |-
  Good Afternoon Everyone,

  Here is the final release of 3.3.1.
  It's not a huge release, but there have been a handful of bug fixes since the last Beta release.
  I will post the changelog between the last beta and this release in the discussion thread below.

  With that said, I have been working quite a lot since the last release, on some of the new formats
  that has yet to be included in Icaros. Hopefully I can include them soon in a new Beta release.

  As always thank you all so much for the donations, bug hunting and help with the translations! ❤️

  I hope you all enjoy the new release!
