ReleaseNotes: |-
  Good Afternoon Everyone,
  I have a slightly smaller release for you today.
  It mainly focuses on updating libraries and fixing a number a bugs, that was reported on the issue tracker.
  I consider the release completely stable, however I'm currently replacing the motherboard of my main
  development machine (it was unfortunately faulty), so I couldn't run all the usual tests before this release.
  So just to be on the safe side, I'm making todays release a Beta release.
  I also just counted up the donations from 2024, so I could share the final amount with all of you as I like to do,
  and I was honestly blown away. Icaros has never had this many donations over the span of a year.
  I am so grateful for all your support, and I can't thank all of you enough for helping me with
  donations, feedback, translations and troubleshooting.
  Total donation amount in 2024:
  $636
  Thank you all so incredibly much! ❤️
  I hope you all enjoy the new release!
