ReleaseNotes: |-
  Good Afternoon Everyone,

  We're closing in on the end of the year and I somehow managed to get out one more 2023 release of Icaros.
  This time I'm skipping the Beta phase, as I don't believe any of the changes will cause any regressions.
  Check the changelog for all the details.

  I hope you've all had a wonderful fall, and as always thank you all so much for the donations,
  troubleshooting and help with the translations! ❤️

  I hope you all enjoy the new release!
