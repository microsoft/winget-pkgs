ReleaseNotes: |-
  Good Afternoon Everyone,
  I have another release today, adding thumbnailing support for EPS and INDD files, and a fix for the thumbnailing of 'tiled' HEIC files, that was reported with the previous Beta.
  Be sure to report any bugs or regressions as always.
  I hope you all enjoy the new release and have a wonderful summer! ❤️

  Icaros v.3.3.3 Beta 2
  - Added support for thumbnailing 'tiled' HEIC files (Fixes 'zoomed in' thumbnails for HEIC files)
  - Added thumbnailing support of EPS files with an embedded preview
  - Added thumbnailing support of INDD files with an embedded preview
  - Added AI, EPS, and INDD to the 'Common' and 'Most Known' presets
  - Improved thumbnailing of AI files
  - AI, EPS and INDD are now registered as image formats
  - The 'View Size' will now only show up in Windows 7 and below, as it is not relevant on newer versions of Windows
  - A couple of minor improvements
  - Updated FFmpeg
