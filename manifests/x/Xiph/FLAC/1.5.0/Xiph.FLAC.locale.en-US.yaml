ReleaseNotes: |-
  As there have been additions to the libFLAC interfaces, the libFLAC version number is incremented to 14. The libFLAC++ version number is incremented to 11.
  - General
    - Multithreaded encoding is now possible in libFLAC and through the flac command line tool
    - The GFDL license file is updated to version 1.3
    - The markdown tool documentation is now also converted to HTML, for bundling with systems that do not read manpages (e.g. Windows)
    - Decoding of chained Ogg FLAC files is now possible (philippe44, Martijn van Beurden)
    - Various fixes (Sam James, Miroslav Lichvar, Cristian Rodríguez, manxorist, kgroeneveld, Lee Carré, Jevin Sweval, braheezy, Wolfgang Stöggl)
    - Is is now possible in libFLAC, libFLAC++ and metaflac to write to a new file when changing metadata, instead of needing to overwrite an existing file
  - flac
    - Testing mode (flac -t) now parses all metadata blocks and warns the user when ID3v1 metadata is detected
    - A warning is displayed when frame numbers do not increase correctly throughout a file
    - The explain option (-H or --explain) is now removed, use the manpage or html tool documentation instead
    - Built-in help and tool documentation are improved (H2Swine)
    - When re-encoding a FLAC file from an existing FLAC file, a check is added that the MD5 sums of both files are the same
  - libFLAC and libFLAC++
    - The library interfaces have been extended. See the porting guide (part of the API documentation)
    - An error is sent when a frame is missing
    - The algorithm of the ‘loose mid side’ option has changed. Instead of checking every few frames which option is best and keeping that for the next few frames, a fast heuristic is now used. This was necessary to enable multithreading
    - Most level 0 metadata interface functions now also work with Ogg FLAC files
    - When encoding Ogg FLAC files, the callback now returns a number of samples instead of always 0 (Jesper Larsson, ziplantil)
    - When changing metadata, libFLAC now detects when an input file is a symlink, and will refuse to write data to it when an in-place rewrite of the metadata cannot happen
    - When encoding using seektable templates, unused seekpoints (with a sample number higher than the total number of samples) are converted to placeholders
  - Build system
    - Fix building on Android with API version < 24 (Steve Lhomme)
    - The microbench utility has been removed
    - Enable building with emscripten (werner mendizabal)
    - Minimum CMake version required (when building with CMake) is now formally 3.12
  - Testing/validation
    - Improve fuzzing of allocation failures
    - Various other fuzzing improvements
  - Documentation
    - The FLAC format is now specified in RFC 9639
    - The foreign metadata storage format used by the flac command line tool is now properly documented
