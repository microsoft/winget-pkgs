ShortDescription: Crushee is an image compression tool, powered by Electron and Node.js.
Description: |-
  Crushee is an image compression tool, powered by Electron and Node.js.
   It accepts JPEG, PNG, GIF, SVG, and WebP files, and will convert to JPEG, PNG, or WebP.
   It's useful for batch optimization and resizing images.
   You can carefully tune your images to meet your needs without having to re-upload or restart every time.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  - An all-new look!
  - Animations and a new layout have been implemented to (hopefully) make the _add->crush->save_ workflow clearer for users.
  - Unfortunately, dark mode is gone for now.
    It'll be back, I promise!
  - Crushee starts up way, way faster.
  - Crushing is now faster, too!
  - Crushing algorithms have been tweaked to better balance quality vs size.
  - New optimization libraries have been implemented to better shave off bytes.
  - GIFs and SVGs can now be optimized.
    The color count on GIFs can be altered when crushed.
  - You can now convert files to PNG.
  - PNGs now resize.
    I knew something didn't seem right with those file sizes...
  - Crushing large numbers of files no longer locks up the app.
    I've tested with up to 20k files and it still worked, though a bit slowly.
  - Crushed JPEGs weren't always readable on Windows.
    Now they are.
  - Status messages should no longer get stuck.
    So if you're seeing a message for a while, it's actually crunching numbers.
  - Everything is more stable in general.
    Especially on Mac.
