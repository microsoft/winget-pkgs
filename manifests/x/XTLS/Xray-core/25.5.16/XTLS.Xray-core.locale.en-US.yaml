  REALITY practice: Support X25519MLKEM768 for TLS' communication
  REALITY 抗量子更新第一弹来袭！升级服务端、客户端至该版本，REALITY target 支持 X25519MLKEM768 时将自动启用
  X25519MLKEM768 可有效预防被“现在记录、以后拿量子计算机解密 TLS 流量”，此外 #3813 (comment)
  最近有越来越多的网站开始支持 X25519MLKEM768 了，所以服务端一定要及时升级，避免新版客户端连不上
  感谢 @yuhan6665 对 REALITY 仓库的维护，以及 @mingyech @BRUHItsABunny 对 uTLS 仓库的维护
  此外从上个版本开始，auto mode 的 XHTTP TLS 默认改为 packet-up，XHTTP REALITY 默认仍为 stream-one
