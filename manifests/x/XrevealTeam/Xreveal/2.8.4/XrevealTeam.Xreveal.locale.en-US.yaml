Description: |-
  Xreveal is a Windows based application similar to AnyDVD that removes restrictions of DVD, and Blu-ray media automatically in the background.

  Xreveal works in the background to automatically and transparently enable read access of the contents of a movie DVD or Blu-ray as soon as it's inserted into the drive. The DVD/Blu-ray will become useable to your windows operating system and all programs on your computer, such as DVD/Blu-ray backup software like CloneDVD, CloneBD and others, then supporting any DVD or Blu-ray. Xreveal optionally removes region codes, thereby making the movie region free and comfortably viewable on any DVD/Blu-ray player and with any DVD/Blu-ray playback software.

  Features:
  - Works automatically in the background.
  - Removes restrictions and region code from DVDs and Blu-rays.
  - Works on-the-fly without the need to store data onto your hard disk.
  - Gets rid of user prohibitions, you can select the language and subtitle track without going through the disc's menu.
  - Can disable BD-Live to protect your privacy.
  - Allows playback of discs requiring a 3D monitor on 2D displays.
  - Running natively on Windows ARM64/x64/x86 devices.
