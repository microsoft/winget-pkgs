ReleaseNotes: |-
  Changes
    - Update Style A Bit More.
    - Added 3 More Options!

  Notes
    - Some of the new keys require that the program is run as administrator to have options to the registry keys.

  There are three provided versions:
    - `OFGB-Deps.exe`: Self-Contained. Includes required runtime dependencies but is a much larger file.
    - `OFGB.exe`: NOT Self-Contained. Drops runtime dependencies resulting in a much smaller file. Requires that .NET 8.0 Desktop Runtime be installed.
    - `OFGB-ARM.exe`: For Computers With ARM CPUs.
