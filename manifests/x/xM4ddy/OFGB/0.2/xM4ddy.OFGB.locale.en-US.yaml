  Changes
    - Fixed Crashing For Some Users When A SubKey Didn't Exist

  There Are Two Version Provided
    - `OFGB-Deps.exe`: Self-Contained. Includes required runtime dependencies but is a much larger file.
    - `OFGB.exe`: NOT Self-Contained. Drops runtime dependencies resulting in a much smaller file. Requires that [.NET 8.0 Desktop Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-8.0.4-windows-x64-installer) be installed.
