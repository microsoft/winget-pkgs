ShortDescription: XCP-ng Center is a Windows-based management tool for XCP-ng and Citrix® XenServer® environments which enables users to manage and monitor XCP-ng and Citrix® XenServer® hosts and resource pools, and to deploy, monitor, manage and migrate virtual machines.
ReleaseNotes: |-
  I'm excited to release the first version of XCP-ng Center under my maintainership, featuring several improvements and changes. Here are the key highlights of this build:
  Portable XCP-ng Center
  You can now run XCP-ng Center as a portable application! Just use the zipped release and create a data folder next to the executable. All log files and configuration data will be stored in that folder, making it easy to carry and run on different systems without installation.
  Command-Line Parameters
  I've added several command-line parameters to support specific use cases. These are particularly helpful for my workflow when deploying new XCP-ng environments for clients.
  Here are the new command parameters you can use:
  - /tempdata: Uses a path in temp for a temporary session, this gets deleted on close. This is great for someone who is setting up new XCP-ng servers at a customer site
  - /datapath: allows you to specify a path to save configuration in.
  MSI Installer
  This release uses a new MSI installer built with a custom tool I developed (replacing WiX). It should upgrade previous installations made with WiX, but if you encounter any issues, please file a bug report and I’ll take a look.
  Notice on builds 25054 and up
  The way settings are done has changed. If you have a previous version of XCP-ng Center installed, your configuration will not migrate over.
  This is due to the new settings system that was implemented in build 25054. You will need to reconfigure your settings. This change is to
  allow for a portable version of XCP-ng Center where the settings and logs will be stored in the same directory as the executable.
