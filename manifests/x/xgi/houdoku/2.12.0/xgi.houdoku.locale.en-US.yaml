ReleaseNotes: |-
  - The filesystem naming of downloaded chapters has improved:
  - Each series directory will now be named the title of the series.
  - Chapter directories will be named Chapter XY.Z - <long_id>
  - Existing downloads will continue to work, but all new chapters downloaded will be placed in the Series.Title directory.
    Houdoku will find all chapters regardless, but you may want to move existing downloads to the new directory.
  - Added a reader max page width setting, which is "Kind of a Zoom"
  - This setting applies when "fit to width" is enabled, and can restrict the maximum width from 10%-100%.
  - Basically, you can make a page take up X% of the window.
  - Added a "Mark all read" right-click menu option for series on the library page.
  - Changed the "long strip margin" setting to be "space between pages", and it now also works with the Double page layout.
  - The client now ignores Windows scaling by default.
    You can use default Chrome bindings -- ctrl-shift-plus, ctrl-minus, ctrl-0 -- to scale the interface.
  - Fixed some reader keybinds not being persisted between restarts.
  - Fixed filesystem extension sometimes ignoring decimals in chapter numbers.
  - Fixed strange UI behavior with empty category textboxes.
  - Fixed several transitive security vulnerabilities.
