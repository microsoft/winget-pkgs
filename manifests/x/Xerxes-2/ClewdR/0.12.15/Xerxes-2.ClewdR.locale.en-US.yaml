ReleaseNotes: |-
  Release Notes
  - fix: stop stripping context-1m beta token at the 200000 max_tokens threshold
  - feat: add Sonnet/Opus 1M tri-state mode (auto-probe / enabled / disabled) with probe-fail auto fallback and auto-disable
  - feat: restore OpenAI -1M model aliases for Sonnet 4/4.5/4.6 and Opus 4.6
  - fix: limit 1M probing to Sonnet 4.x and Opus 4.6 lanes
  - fix: split 429 handling for 1M flow (long-context gate 429 falls back without cooling cookie; normal rate-limit 429 still cools cookie)
