ShortDescription: High Performance LLM Reverse Proxy
Description: |-
  High-Performance LLM Proxy
  Specifically built for Claude (Claude.ai) and Gemini (Google AI Studio, Google Vertex AI)

  Core Advantages
  Full-Featured Frontend
  - Integrated React frontend providing a complete functional experience
  Efficient Architecture
  - Occupies one-tenth the resources compared to script language implementations, with ten times the performance, easily handling thousands of requests per second
  - Event-driven design, decoupled logic, supports hot reloading and multiple configuration methods
  - High-performance response caching supported by Moka technology
  - Multi-threaded asynchronous processing based on Tokio and Axum
  - Fingerprint-level Chrome simulation Rquest HTTP client
  Intelligent Cookie Management
  - Automatic classification and management of account status
  - Fine-grained polling mechanism to maximize resource utilization
  Full Platform Compatibility
  - Rust static compilation, single binary deployment, no environment dependencies needed
  - Native support for macOS/Android and other platforms
  - Extremely low memory usage (only single-digit MB)
  - No need for virtual machines or complex dependencies
  Enhanced Features
  - Built-in proxy server support (no TUN required)
  - Concurrent cache request handling
  - Gemini additional support:
    - Google AI Studio and Google Vertex AI
    - OpenAI compatible mode / Gemini format
    - Painless HTTP Keep-Alive support
  - Claude additional support:
    - OpenAI compatible mode / Claude format
    - Extend Thinking
    - Stop sequences implemented on the proxy side
    - Image attachment uploads
    - Web search
    - Claude Max

ReleaseNotes: |-
  Fix
  - Update Check: Skip update check if no_fs feature is enabled to avoid unnecessary network requests and potential errors in environments where filesystem access is not available.
  v0.11.0
  Features
  - OpenAI API Transform: Add transforms_json function to convert Claude API responses to OpenAI format with proper usage mapping and finish reason conversion
  - No-FS Configuration: Replace compile-time no_fs feature with runtime configuration option for flexible deployment scenarios
  - Enhanced Logging: Automatic log directory creation and improved file logging setup with tokio console support
  - Thinking Mode Support: Add proper thinking mode configuration with budget token support and type validation
  Improvements
  - Request Processing: Simplify Claude Web request transformation by removing API format branching and unused OpenAI compatibility layer
  - UI Cleanup: Remove padding text configuration from frontend components and related localization entries
  - State Management: Refactor middleware state handling with improved generic type support and cleaner FromRequest implementations
  - Response Handling: Unify response processing using forward_response utility and remove duplicate response transformation logic
  - Performance: Replace chrono with stdtimeInstant for more accurate request timing measurements
  - Code Organization: Restructure Gemini middleware path handling and improve import organization
  Fixes
  - Dependencies: Update multiple dependencies including clap, h2, ractor, security-framework, and zerovec to latest compatible versions
  - Docker: Complete overhaul of Dockerfile using distroless images, musl targeting, and optimized alpine-based cargo-chef builds
  - Licensing: Add proper AGPL-3.0 license declaration in Cargo.toml
  - API Compatibility: Fix return types across Claude API endpoints and correct error response type conversions
  - Frontend Dependencies: Update frontend package dependencies and resolve pnpm lock file conflicts
  Removed
  - Debug Dockerfile: Remove separate debug Dockerfile in favor of unified build process
  - Padding System: Remove token padding configuration and random text generation functionality
  - API Format Handling: Remove dual API format support in favor of unified Claude API handling
