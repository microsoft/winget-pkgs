ShortDescription: A structured editor based on GNU TeXmacs
Description: |-
  Mogan Editor is a structured editor based on GNU TeXmacs.
  Mogan is named after Mount Mogan, a famous attraction in my hometown. 墨干(Mogan) literally means "dried ink". The word is derived from 莫干(Mogan) which is a combination of 莫(Mo) and 干(Gan).
  GNU TeXmacs is for Scientists, Mogan is for Writers.
